        <p>On a November day in 1776, a 25-year-old woman named Margaret Corbin joined her husband, John, in defending Fort Washington, in Upper Manhattan, from an attack by the British. When John Corbin was killed, his wife took over at the cannon he had been firing and fought valiantly until she herself was shot.</p>
        <p>The British overtook the fort, but Margaret Corbin survived and passed into legend. Two centuries later, her heroics were commemorated on a large bronze plaque on 190th Street and Fort Washington Avenue.</p>
        <p>Last month, the spirit of Margaret Corbin came to the rescue again, for a community board in an uncomfortable situation at the other end of the city in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn. The battle this time surrounded a half-mile-long street called Corbin Place, named for one Austin Corbin, a 19th-century developer who ran the Long Island Rail Road, ousted the Montaukett tribe from its home in the Hamptons in a contested land deal and was a leader of the American Society for the Suppression of Jews.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corbin's anti-Semitism and the street name's provenance came to light in a January column by Denis Hamill in The Daily News, prompting local officials to join forces to change it.</p>
        <p>''He used the word 'exterminate,' which was a precursor to Nazism,'' City Councilman Michael Nelson of Sheepshead Bay, a leading advocate of dropping the street name, said last week.</p>
        <p>The only problem: Many residents of Corbin Place, including even a few rabbis, did not want to change their addresses or argued that keeping the name, in an area with a heavily Jewish population, was the best revenge against hatred. The debate raged on a snowy night in February, when the local community board put off a decision for a month.</p>
        <p>Then someone hit upon a solution: Margaret Corbin. On March 27, the board voted to rename Corbin Place for Margaret, not Austin.</p>
        <p>At first, Councilman Nelson's support was reluctant. ''But she is a wonderful woman, a woman of valor, this Margaret Corbin,'' he said last week.</p>
        <p>The measure moves next to the City Council, where it is likely to be approved.</p>
        <p>''It arose from nowhere, but it was the greatest compromise,'' said the board's chairwoman, Theresa Scavo. ''Brooklyn people know how to think on their feet.''</p>

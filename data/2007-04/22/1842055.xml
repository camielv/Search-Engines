        <p>Questions are on Page 30. Explanations are excerpted from the Educational Testing Service's practice exams.</p>
        <p>1. a. Overload refers to adjusting the amount of exercise to a person's present capacity; progression refers to gradually increasing exercise over time to improve fitness.  2. b. Basketball was developed at a YMCA in Massachusetts as an indoor winter activity.  3. a. The primary role was played by physicians interested in anthropometry and other medically related subjects.  4. a.  5. c.  6. b. Skipping is a combination of a step and a hop. Combining these is difficult at earlier stages of development.  7. b. For young children, such training could damage the growth plates or growth areas in the bone, typically through epiphyseal separations.  8. a. Children at this age are concerned with their own needs.  9. b. Children become increasingly aware of their environment and the individuals who infuence their surroundings.  10. b. At these ages the most profound gender differences are in positioning the arm and trunk, plus leg mechanics.  11. c.  12. b. The common strategy is to get off to a fast start and finish with the fastest runner.  13. a. Contacting the ball with the heel of a cupped or open hand provides for surface coverage of the ball and control over the ball.  14. d. Although most players, even at fairly advanced levels, will have better control with the dominant foot than with the nondominant foot, it is still essential that practice in dribbling at every level emphasize use of both feet.  15. c. All three activities require a compact arrangement of the body so that it can move smoothly through the medium (air or water). The failure to observe this would hinder movement by creating turbulence.  16. d. After skiing, walking expends the most energy, followed by bowling and volleyball.  17. b.  18. c. With age, ever-greater percentages of body cells become less metabolically active, generally causing more body fat to accumulate over time.  19. b. Lower back pain may result from muscular damage, dislocation, fracture or other problems with spinal vertebrae or discs.  20. a.</p>

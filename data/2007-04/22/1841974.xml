      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The British composer Nicholas Maw, born in 1935, is generally described as a Neo-Romantic. But that does not tell it all. His elegant works are also filled with striking modern touches that make them elusive and fresh. The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center presents the premiere of Mr. Maw's String Sextet. Preceding it are pieces by composers Mr. Maw cites as strong influences: Haydn, Schumann, Bruckner, Strauss and Britten. Friday at 8 p.m., next Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50.</p>
        <p>Speaking of the Chamber Music Society, the players of the Vermeer Quartet, founded in 1969 at the Marlboro Music Festival, come from Israel, Germany, Nebraska and New York. This eminent string quartet has announced that its current tour will be its last. The final New York concert includes works by Schubert, Britten and Dvorak. Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall; $30 to $52.</p>
        <p>Then there is the program by the Metropolitan Museum Artists in Concert, the museum's house ensemble, which boasts a roster of strong and noted players. This unusual program offers two early Schoenberg works: the audacious String Quartet No. 2 and his surprisingly effective cabaret songs, ''Brettl-Lieder.'' Works by Schubert and Brahms complete the program. Friday at 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $30.</p>
        <p>Enough with chamber music. Those who attend the American Composers Orchestra's concert may some day brag that they heard John Adams conduct three of his own works, major scores all: ''My Father Knew Charles Ives''; the Violin Concerto, with the dynamic Leila Josefowicz as soloist; and ''The Wound-Dresser,'' a profound setting of Walt Whitman's poem about his experience tending to injured Civil War soldiers. The bass-baritone Eric Owens is soloist in this vocally and emotionally challenging work. Friday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $16 to $43.</p>

        <p>The Old State House in Hartford has been given a reprieve by the governor -- for now.</p>
        <p>Gov. M. Jodi Rell announced on April 11 that she would ask legislators for the money to keep the Old State House open for the rest of the year, while a long-term financial plan is being worked out. In March, she said the state would make $600,000 available to repair the roof.</p>
        <p>Christopher Cooper, a spokesman for Mrs. Rell, said there was bipartisan support in the legislature for keeping the Old State House open.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the Connecticut Historical Society said it would have to close it this summer because of a lack of money. The $200,000 the state has been providing each year runs out June 30.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Rell said she was forming a group that would include members of her staff, the General Assembly, the Office of Policy and Management and the Commission on Culture and Tourism, as well as the state historian, to work with the historical society to develop a long-term financial plan by Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>''We are genuinely excited about the interest the governor and the legislature have shown to work this out,'' said Kate Steinway, the historical society's executive director.</p>
        <p>The Old State House, one of the state's two capitol buildings from 1796 until 1878 (the other was in New Haven) and Hartford's City Hall from 1878 until 1915, is owned by the City of Hartford and leased to the state. It gets about 36,000 visitors a year and has an annual budget of about $1 million. ''The Old State House is a treasure that is part of Connecticut's cultural identify,'' Mrs. Rell said in a statement. ''We cannot allow it to be neglected.''</p>

        <p>Gov. Jon S. Corzine was able to speak to doctors and family members yesterday for the first time since his initial surgery for the injuries he suffered in a car accident nine days ago, his doctors said. But, they added, the governor had developed a bronchial infection that the medical team was treating with antibiotics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, 60, remained in critical but stable condition in the trauma intensive care unit at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, N.J.</p>
        <p>Until Friday afternoon, he had been on a ventilator that had kept him from talking. Dr. Steven E. Ross, head of Cooper's trauma division, said the bronchitis had not prevented Mr. Corzine from breathing on his own, and despite the pain from his broken sternum and 12 fractured ribs, he was able to cough and clear his lungs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine was able to ''tolerate a small amount of clear liquids,'' Dr. Ross said. He did not say when doctors might be able to remove Mr. Corzine's feeding tube.</p>
        <p>''The governor continues to receive bedside physical therapy and has been able to tolerate well the body movements that come with dressing changes,'' Dr. Ross said in a written statement. ''Additionally, the team is pleased with the status of the leg injury, which is showing no sign of infection.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's femur was badly broken and punctured his left thigh twice. Doctors have operated on the leg three times since he was admitted to Cooper on April 12 after the accident on the Garden State Parkway.</p>
        <p>Drainage tubes have been inserted into both sides of Mr. Corzine's chest to clear fluid buildup outside his lungs, and Dr. Ross said he hoped to remove the one on the right side late Saturday.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Corzine, Anthony Coley, would not say what the governor told his family or doctors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine was not wearing a seat belt when his Chevrolet Suburban crashed on the way to a meeting at the governor's mansion in Princeton. A data recorder in the vehicle showed that it had been traveling at 91 miles per hour a few seconds before the accident.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey attorney general, Stuart Rabner, is investigating the accident to determine whether the state should tighten restrictions on the troopers who drive the governor. The crash is also under review by the New Jersey State Police, which is looking at whether the trooper driving the Suburban, Robert Rasinski, might have been able to prevent the accident.</p>
        <p>According to a police union official, investigators have asked whether Trooper Rasinski was using his cellphone at the time of the crash.</p>
        <p>The Star-Ledger of Newark reported yesterday that on the day of the accident, Trooper Rasinski had received an angry e-mail message from a police officer in Berkeley Heights, N.J., who is in the middle of a divorce and whose wife has been dating the trooper. David Jones, president of the Fraternal Order of State Police, said that Trooper Rasinski didn't open the e-mail message until he was released from the hospital.</p>
        <p>State police investigators have taken Trooper Rasinski's cellphone to corroborate his assertion that he had not used it after he picked up Mr. Corzine in Atlantic City for the trip to Princeton on the night of the crash, Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>''Whatever was happening in his personal life had nothing to do with the crash,'' Mr. Jones said. ''He was focused on driving and acting professionally when he driving Governor Corzine.''</p>

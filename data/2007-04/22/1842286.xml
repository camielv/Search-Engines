        <p>JUST about everybody likes a riddle, so here goes: What city, known in part for spectacular green spaces designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, was named by CNNMoney.com in November as one of the 20 housing markets nationwide that are likely to post the biggest home-price gains by 2011?</p>
        <p>Believe it or not, it's Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>The median home price declined last year in Fairfield, Bridgeport's fashionable neighbor to the west, but prices held steady in the desirable Black Rock section of Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the price levels are much lower in Bridgeport than in Fairfield, but officials say this will help to attract adventurous prospective residents to the city. ''Low prices, high potential, expected returns and high risks,'' summed up John Clapp, a professor at the Center for Real Estate at the University of Connecticut. ''It might be a good bet on average.''</p>
        <p>But the first part of this year has not been good for Bridgeport, Professor Clapp said. Within the city, the overall number of home sales declined 9 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with 2006.</p>
        <p>Commercial development is seen as a way to attract people to Bridgeport. The Ballpark at Harbor Yard, a minor league baseball stadium, and the nearby Arena at Harbor Yard, a sports and entertainment site used by an American Hockey League team, Fairfield University's basketball teams and theater productions, are already drawing crowds to events near the waterfront, which is seen as a great untapped asset.</p>
        <p>Now, the city is working to secure one last parcel for Steel Point, a planned $1.5 billion six-million-square-foot project on a 52-acre peninsula in the harbor. This is envisioned as including 3,500 luxury residences, a marina, a retail center, entertainment facilities, offices, a hotel and conference center and a public esplanade. The prospective developer is Midtown Equities, a Manhattan-based developer.</p>
        <p>In addition, four development teams have been selected to submit proposals by May 31 for the nearby Pequonnock site. This project would have stores and apartments, including a tower at least 10 stories high. One team includes the former Los Angeles Lakers basketball star Magic Johnson; another includes Roger Staubach, the former quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
        <p>The Pequonnock site, owned by the city and the Bridgeport Housing Authority, comprises three parcels. One is a former housing project, another a defunct Underwood typewriter factory and a third an orphaned piece of land now used as overflow parking for the Arena at Harbor Yard. The city has requested that the developers submit ''pedestrian friendly'' designs.</p>
        <p>As for the existing housing stock, homeowners say the market seems relatively strong. Lynne Interlandi, who has lived in the Black Rock section for 25 years, said she had recently sold her deceased in-laws' condominium in Black Rock in 22 hours. To her surprise, the 25-year-old one-bedroom condo, which has never been updated, had two bids at the asking price, $159,900, which she considered high.</p>
        <p>''I think we're up and coming in Bridgeport,'' Mrs. Interlandi said. ''When I first moved in here, Fairfield Avenue was filled with little mom-and-pop stores, video stores, small shops. Now it's restaurants and coffeehouses and some of the best restaurants in the city.''</p>
        <p>There are also signs that the city's long-suffering downtown may be improving. Increasing numbers of residents are moving in, many of them as renters. A former Warnaco factory was converted into 120 Manhattan-style loft rentals, which went on the market in 2004.</p>
        <p>Artists, so often the first to recolonize distressed areas, have moved into rentals in the Artspace building, a former Read's department store. ''The artists also bring a heck of a lot of personality to the building,'' said Joseph Celli, an oboist and composer who moved in two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Celli has a development of his own: the Black Rock Arts Center, a third-floor space for art shows and performances. He is backed by a 300-volunteer organization. ''We think the arts center is emblematic of the direction the city needs to be moving in in the future,'' Mr. Celli said.</p>
        <p>A founding director of the alternative art space Real Art Ways in Hartford, Mr. Celli moved back to Bridgeport to care for his aging parents, and eventually decided to move downtown.</p>
        <p>Nancy Hadley, the director of the city's Office of Planning and Economic Development, says she believes that, with its visibility as a financial news and advice Web site, CNNMoney.com's inclusion of Bridgeport on a list of cities with housing potential promised to help development efforts.</p>
        <p>According to her, one key step in Bridgeport's turnaround occurred in 2005, when city officials called on the Urban Land Institute, a Washington-based research organization, to conduct a study outlining solutions to some of the city's problems.</p>
        <p>''They ripped us apart and put us back together,'' she said, ''and we've been following that blueprint the past two years. The land is beautiful, the access is wonderful, the beach you can't beat. What we needed to do as a city was become transparent and accountable.''</p>
        <p>Bridgeport has had a recent history of public corruption. Both a former mayor and a state senator are serving prison terms, and the current mayor, John M. Fabrizi, admitted not long ago in a press conference that he had been abusing cocaine and alcohol.</p>
        <p>Despite his troubles, however, Mr. Fabrizi has been a strong advocate for making the most of the city's proximity to the water and to the wealthiest towns in the state.</p>
        <p>''We all know Bridgeport is undervalued,'' considering its location, said Gail Robinson, a local realtor who writes a blog about the Black Rock neighborhood, where she lives.</p>
        <p>''The risk is, will there be another scandal, more corruption? It always seems when we are going to get on our feet, something else happens. It isn't for people looking for a low-risk investment. But it's not a high-risk investment anymore, either. You're seeing lots of money coming in, and lots of investment taking place.''</p>
        <p>But it is the homeowners like Ms. Interlandi, as they watch new retail shops and restaurants open in their neighborhoods, who are taking the pulse of the city in a more intuitive way. ''It will be awhile, I'm sure,'' Ms. Interlandi said. ''But we have a lot of hope.''</p>

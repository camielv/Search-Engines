        <p>TOMORROW is the first day of TV-Turnoff Week, and I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I want to comply. It's a cause that has my sympathy. On the other hand, television is one of the few places where my 15-year-old son, Asher, and I can hang out together. That might sound blighted, and the penurious nature of our present relations might be all my fault, but it is what it is. Some people have Paris. We have ''Animal Cops: Houston.''</p>
        <p>Accepting this hasn't come easily. When Asher was little and controllable, it was possible to stick to my resolve of raising him with a minimum of television in his life. I wasn't allowed to watch more than half an hour a week when I was growing up, and my mother's claims that it was a waste of time, a destroyer of brain cells, a purveyor of unhealthy food and unnecessary material items, which seemed like a paranoid rant at the time, came to make sense to me as an adult.</p>

        <p>TOMORROW is the first day of TV-Turnoff Week, and I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I want to comply. It's a cause that has my sympathy. On the other hand, television is one of the few places where my 15-year-old son, Asher, and I can hang out together. That might sound blighted, and the penurious nature of our present relations might be all my fault, but it is what it is. Some people have Paris. We have ''Animal Cops: Houston.''</p>
        <p>Accepting this hasn't come easily. When Asher was little and controllable, it was possible to stick to my resolve of raising him with a minimum of television in his life. I wasn't allowed to watch more than half an hour a week when I was growing up, and my mother's claims that it was a waste of time, a destroyer of brain cells, a purveyor of unhealthy food and unnecessary material items, which seemed like a paranoid rant at the time, came to make sense to me as an adult.</p>
        <p>Eventually, however, Asher discovered the fascinations to be found inside the idiot box -- at a friend's house, wherefrom all manner of temptation emanates. Life was never the same again. The begging began. For years I informed him sweetly that he would have to turn off the TV in 10 minutes, then 5, then 2, a method designed to effect a smooth transition from one activity to the next and give him time to internalize my request incrementally. I read about this technique and it sounded both respectful and effective -- doesn't it? -- but it never worked, ever, not even once. The sequence always ended with me screaming ''Turn that thing off now!''</p>
        <p>And then something unexpected happened. In a limited way, accompanied by much grumbling, I caved. That's when television became our friend, a third presence in the room that gave us a focus during the hundreds of nights when he and I ate dinner while my husband was at work. A boy has only so much to say to his mother in the eight-hour stretch between the end of school and the beginning of the go-to-bed-now fight, so we got in the habit of watching while we ate.</p>
        <p>I know -- this goes against every piece of advice delivered in every parenting magazine and by all the family organizations in the country. Dinner is supposed to be a time for the family to connect and bond, a respite from the demands of our busy modern lives. I'm here to say that watching reruns of ''Friends,'' ''Seinfeld'' and ''Will &amp; Grace'' over steaming plates of vegetarian tacos can be a very bonding experience.</p>
        <p>Asher is an only child, and seeing all those ensembles of friends hanging out together gave him a vicarious inkling of what it feels like to belong to a robust, connected group. I, too, loved these shows, and am attracted to the fantasy of friends who stick together no matter what. It's a soothing construct, and it made our dinners the stuff of happy, if not traditional, memories.</p>
        <p>As Asher grew older we moved on to stronger stuff. It wasn't easy to find shows that suited us both. For a while we were limited to ''Storm Stories'' and other adventure shows -- particularly anything to do with mountain climbing in the snow, an activity in which neither of us will ever participate. Outside of that arena, we didn't have much in common. You'd think with hundreds of hours of programming that it would be easy, but it took years. We tried, but nothing worked. So we went along, watching in separate rooms, until we found ''The O.C.,'' which ended a four-year run in February. It was an ideal mother-son show, because the drama centered on the lives and loves of two teenage boys. For me it was a nighttime soap that filled a hole in my heart where ''Knots Landing'' used to be. Asher liked the characters, particularly Seth Cohen. Once again we belonged to groups of friends, both teenage and adults, who interlaced with each other in various combinations.</p>
        <p>We were loyal viewers from the first episode. Asher immediately got into the spirit of excess and exaggeration that makes such shows as irresistible as the corn chips he likes to eat while watching them. ''The O.C.'' had the fantasy appeal of southern California settings that are jaw-dropping from the vantage point of our heavily trafficked truck-route street in New Jersey. There was the beautiful house on the Pacific Palisades where the Cohen family lived. The idyllic Harbor High, where the kids ate their healthy California lunch on a high terrace with an ocean view. The endless broad beach, where the characters surfed and kissed and got drunk and died. It was all attractive -- both over the top and with plots topical enough to inspire Asher to ask questions about those teen subjects that need to be discussed but create too fraught an encounter when approached as a ''talk,'' like the charming episode when Seth and Summer first had sex and were less than enchanted with the experience.</p>
        <p>Lately, our viewing has further evolved into a true expression of a shared sensibility. When Asher was younger, he wanted us to watch things because he liked them. Now he leads me to movies and shows he thinks I will like. He knew I'd like ''Entourage'' and ''Da G Show''; I loved them both. He introduced me to the music of Fela Kuti and made me watch a biopic about him. I've watched it over and over since. How did you know? I ask him. It's a foolish question; the powerless always know the boss. I'm not going to be in charge of him much longer. Soon he'll be gone, off discovering bigger and more important things that he likes. I am at the stage with him where I can imagine how all this could go. We could have fun together when he is a grownup. We could know each other in a real way. That's the dream. In the meantime, ''The Colbert Report'' and ''House'' draw us together on the sofa. So be it.</p>
        <p>A couple of weeks ago Asher asked me to re-see a movie with him. ''Are you sure you want to see it again so soon?'' I asked. ''I want to see your face when you watch it,'' he said. ''You're going to love it.'' I considered telling him that one of the great pleasures of my life is watching his face as he focuses on something he enjoys, but I guess he already knows.</p>

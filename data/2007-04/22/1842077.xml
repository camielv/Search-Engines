        <p>Editorial calls on New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and lawmakers to fix state's political system by reforming campaign financing and ending gerrymandering</p>

        <p>Okay, Governor Spitzer and New York lawmakers. You finished the budget, only a few hours late, but it's done. You took your spring vacation. Now it is time to tackle one of the truly terrible, disgraceful things about New York's political scene -- the ossified, uncompetitive, self-serving system that virtually guarantees legislators jobs for life.</p>
        <p>There is more job security in Albany than there once was in Albania. There is less turnover than in the last outposts of tenured academia, a better chance of a lifelong job than in the strongest of union strongholds.</p>

        <p>Okay, Governor Spitzer and New York lawmakers. You finished the budget, only a few hours late, but it's done. You took your spring vacation. Now it is time to tackle one of the truly terrible, disgraceful things about New York's political scene -- the ossified, uncompetitive, self-serving system that virtually guarantees legislators jobs for life.</p>
        <p>There is more job security in Albany than there once was in Albania. There is less turnover than in the last outposts of tenured academia, a better chance of a lifelong job than in the strongest of union strongholds.</p>
        <p>All those years in office do not guarantee more wisdom. They mostly mean more paralysis, more petrifaction. With no fresh ideas, no fresh air, the place gets downright moldy.</p>
        <p>But here's the real problem. The legislators really don't want competition. So while Gov. Eliot Spitzer has promised to push for reform, he's going to have a very tough time actually selling it. Which means that those of us outside the Albany bubble need to start wielding needles:</p>
        <p>Reform Campaign Financing.  One vital task is to end a campaign financing system that discourages competition. The system is full of scams and loopholes. One is something called the housekeeping account, which allows political leaders to shift campaign donations into their personal larders.</p>
        <p>Another allows political action committees to give unlimited amounts to candidates. This gives Albany's powerful lobbyists even more power. Under current law, assuming he created a PAC, or gave to a New York political party and labeled it ''housekeeping'', Bill Gates could donate his entire fortune.</p>
        <p>There are other outrages. An individual may contribute a whopping $56,000 to a statewide candidate, far more than the $4,600 he's allowed to give to a presidential candidate during a whole election year. The personal use of campaign funds (country clubs, cars, even pet food ) is a scandal; enforcement by the state Board of Elections is a joke.</p>
        <p>The word in Albany is that lawmakers would much prefer a sham reform that merely nibbles at the high-end contributions and, more importantly, doesn't really close the biggest loopholes -- those for PACs and housekeeping accounts.</p>
        <p>Some lawmakers hide behind the excuse that public financing will cost money. But reform would be much less costly than letting lobbyists buy political favors at taxpayer expense.</p>
        <p>End Gerrymandering. The other basic scandal is the way legislators create their own districts. New York needs to create a truly independent redistricting commission like the one in Iowa that creates districts fairly and equitably. Right now, legislators essentially pick their own voters, a reversal of the way democracy is supposed to work.</p>
        <p>Despite protestations of innocence, the Albany crowd will try every trick in their repertoire to avoid making these changes. The State Senate has proposed term limits -- a press release, no more. And Mr. Spitzer has said he is interested in a constitutional amendment to create an independent commission. He'll need a political cattle prod to get legislators to go along.</p>
        <p>The governor and his fellow reformers are not without allies, including the state's good government groups, who speak for many ordinary voters. More than 20 of these organizations are rallying in Albany tomorrow for a ''Reform NY Day of Action.'' Mr. Spitzer and the legislature should go one better and make 2007 the Year of Reform.</p>

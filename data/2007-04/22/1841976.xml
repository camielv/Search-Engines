        <p>Many consider CARLOS SAURA, the left-wing Spanish director who challenged the restrictions of the Franco regime, to be the father of modern Spanish cinema. A leader of the movement labeled the New Spanish Cinema in the 1960s, Mr. Saura established his international reputation with sociopolitical allegories like ''Peppermint Frappé'' (1967), ''Garden of Delights'' (1970) and ''Cría Cuervos'' (1976). An international hit, ''Cría'' told the story of a precocious 9-year-old girl using the notion of arrested childhood (a recurrent theme in his work) as a metaphor for growing up under fascism. The movie, filmed while Franco was dying, was released only after his death. These are among the two dozen films directed by Mr. Saura in ''COMMITMENT AND GRACE,'' a comprehensive anthology presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>After Spain's transition to democracy, Mr. Saura largely retreated from politics to explore Spanish culture, spectacularly in three dance films: ''Blood Wedding,'' a flamenco interpretation of García Lorca's masterpiece; ''Carmen'' (1983), which was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign film; and ''Flamenco'' (1995), an elegant, fiery documentary study of flamenco styles photographed by Vittorio Storaro.</p>
        <p>''Goya in Bordeaux'' (1999), which follows the 82-year-old painter through the streets of that French city as he reflects on his life and work, is a magnificent fusion of biography and art. Another high point is the satire ''¡Ay, Carmela!'' (1990), in which Mr. Saura returned to the Spanish Civil War as a subject. Starring Carmen Maura, it tells the story of a troupe of performers with Republican sympathies arrested by Nationalists in 1938 who, to save themselves, must suddenly adjust their act. Through May 3, Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org.</p>

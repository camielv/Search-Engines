        <p>In its hunt for slogans to lure tourists, the nation's capital has never lit on the elegance of a ''Virginia Is for Lovers'' or the panache of a ''What Happens Here, Stays Here.''</p>
        <p>''A Capital City'' was fine for a while, until high murder rate in the late 1980s produced an unwanted double meaning. And while residents lined up for ''Taxation Without Representation'' license plates in 2000, that tagline was more local protest than tourist come-on.</p>
        <p>This time, Washington is taking a more studious approach. Tourism officials have hired two brand research firms to convene focus groups and conduct international surveys of attitudes. In addition, a Web site, shareyourdc.com, invites the city's 582,000 residents -- and anyone else, for that matter -- to propose slogans and take part in weekly polls.</p>
        <p>''This isn't a few people sitting around a room saying, 'Hey, let's come up with this slogan,' '' said Dan Mesches, president of Star Restaurant Group and chairman of the city's Brand Strategy Task Force, a panel of local leaders in business, travel and the arts. ''This is an extensive and exhaustive search for what people in town are thinking and what people out of town are thinking.''</p>
        <p>A sampling of submissions range from sober epigrams like ''The City of National Monuments'' to playful one-liners like ''It's Capital, by George'' and ''Your Party's Here!''</p>
        <p>Local blogs have been flooded with more irreverent proposals. ''Mistakes Were Made,'' ''Where Attorneys Roam'' and ''Dude, Where's My Car?'' are some of the printable ones.</p>
        <p>Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said he wanted a catchphrase that braids the themes of ''unity, energy and renaissance.''</p>
        <p>''You want to have a slogan where people just say, 'That's what I think about when I think about the nation's capital,' '' said Mr. Fenty. ''We want it to touch people.''</p>
        <p>With the White House, the Capitol and oceans of monuments and museums, Washington has rarely wanted for busloads of students on field trips or families on a weekend of sightseeing. In 2005, the last year of available figures, some 15 million visitors spent $5 billion here, generating $543 million in tax revenue.</p>
        <p>The search for a slogan is part of a larger ''branding'' initiative to spice up the city's image.</p>
        <p>Victoria Isley, a tourism official here, said the campaign, set to start in the fall, would try in part to sell higher-income visitors on the ''D.C. beyond C-Span'' -- a growing arts and nightlife scene, newly vibrant neighborhoods and a crop of new hotels, theaters and restaurants.</p>
        <p>''There is an old stereotype that I think still exists -- that Washington is not that fun, it closes after dark, it's a one-note town,'' said Keith Bellows, editor in chief of National Geographic Traveler and an adviser to the brand task force. ''If you want to broaden people's perspective, you need to take a different tack.''</p>

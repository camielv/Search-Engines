        <p>THE MARKET</p>
        <p>The News -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at record highs for three consecutive sessions, topping out at 12,961.98 on Friday following encouraging earnings reports.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The rise of the Dow came just two months after its biggest fall in percentage terms since March 2003, when it closed down 416.02 points, or 3.29 percent on Feb. 27. That drop followed a global wave of selling set off by a plunge in China's stock market. This time, the American market appeared to shrug off news that China may raise interest rates to cool down its economy, which grew 11.1 percent in the first quarter. The broader market struggled on the first two record days, with losing stocks outnumbering advancers, but by Friday, winners far outpaced losers.</p>
        <p>THE DIAMOND</p>
        <p>The News -- Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees' third baseman, set an American League record by hitting 12 home runs in the first 15 games of the season.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- As baseball's highest-paid player ($252 million over 10 years) he was leading the American and National Leagues not only in home runs as of Friday night, but in runs batted in, with 30, and was batting ..371. He has come through dramatically in the clutch, as well, twice hitting game-winning home runs to center field with two outs in the ninth inning.Though the season is in its infancy, there is already concern in the Yankee organization that Rodriquez might opt out of his contract at the end of the season and become a free agent. How to describe his performance so far? ''Scary,'' said his manager, Joe Torre.</p>
        <p>THE POUND</p>
        <p>The News -- The British pound rose above $2, its highest level against the dollar since 1981.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- This may not be the summer for Americans to hop across the pond for a visit. But for the British, it's another story. Travel agents in Britain have reported a 30 percent increase in bookings for American vacations in recent weeks as the pound edged upward, according to The Times of London. Europeans may be joining them, as the dollar has also been declining against the euro. The pound's rise came after a surge in British inflation led to expectations that the Bank of England would raise interest rates, increasing demand for the pound as investors look for bigger returns there. Some analysts expect the pound to remain above $2 for a while.</p>
        <p>THE INVESTOR</p>
        <p>The News -- Mutual funds distributed a record $418.5 billion to investors in 2006, surpassing the previous high set in 2000 by nearly $42 billion, according to estimates by Lipper, a fund research company.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- It was also a good year for Uncle Sam. Those investors paid at least $23.8 billion in taxes on their capital gains, dividend and interest income, according to Lipper. Still, the tax bite was $7.5 billion less than in 2000, because of reductions in the tax rates. But Lipper warned that ''the tax holiday of sorts is over'' because mutual funds can no longer carry forward losses from the bear market of 2000 to 2002 to offset future gains. Over all, investors in mutual funds experienced what Lipper called ''another banner year'' with stock funds returning an average 14.78 percent.</p>
        <p>THE HAIRCUT</p>
        <p>The News -- John Edwards, one of the Democratic presidential candidates, spent $400 for a haircut in Los Angeles, his campaign said.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Actually, it was $800, for two haircuts in recent months, both by the Beverly Hills hairstylist Joseph Torrenueva. He usually charges $175, but upped the fee to $400 because he went to Mr. Edwards rather than seeing him at his salon. The last political haircut to make big headlines was in 1993, when former President Bill Clinton paid $200 for a trim by Christophe, another Beverly Hills stylist, as Air Force One sat at Los Angeles International Airport. Mr. Clinton was skewered then, as Mr. Edwards was last week. ''John Edwards has a new campaign slogan,'' joked Jay Leno. ''Shampoo, rinse, repeat.''</p>

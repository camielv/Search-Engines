        <p>He had six wives, gout, a feud with the pope and a heck of time producing a male heir. And on June 28 -- 498 years after he acceded to the throne of England -- Henry VIII will get his own permanent exhibition at the Hampton Court Palace outside of London. ''Young Henry VIII,'' the first segment of an exhibition honoring the 500th anniversary of Henry's reign, will feature paintings from the Royal Collection and audiovisual displays that explore the history of the Tudor Dynasty, the themes of war and European expansion, and Henry's personal life, including his relationship with Catherine of Aragon up to the arrival of Anne Boleyn.

The Eurail Group is offering two new regional passes: Czech Republic and Germany, and Poland and Germany. The passes, which allow for 5, 6, 8 or 10 days of travel between two bordering countries within a two-month period, have first- and second-class versions. For example, the price for the second-class, five-day Germany-Poland pass is $320 per person (www.eurail.com).  This summer, a 19th-century flour mill in Venice will make its debut as a luxury hotel. The Hilton Molino Stucky Venice, housed in a neo-Gothic Revival building along the Canale della Giudecca (above), will offer 380 rooms, a rooftop pool, and a private landing jetty. Rates are expected to start at 750 euros, or $1,020 at $1.36 to the euro(www.molinostuckyhilton.com). TourCrafters (www.tourcrafters.com) is offering hotel deals in Italy this summer, like the four nights for the price of three deal at the Hotel Brasile in Rome (rates start at 100 euros).  Trafalgar has a new eight-day CostSaver Spanish Experience vacation. Rates start at $1,035 a person (www.trafalgar.com).</p>

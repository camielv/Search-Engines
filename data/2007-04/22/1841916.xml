        <p>OUT OF PAKISTAN: Mohsin Hamid's second novel, ''The Reluctant Fundamentalist'' (it's reviewed on Page 8 by Karen Olsson), makes a mighty debut on the fiction list at No. 6. Hamid's book has made news, in part because of the provocative opinions of its protagonist -- a cultivated young Pakistani, working in New York after graduating from Princeton, who finds himself sympathizing with the 9/11 attackers. (He is pleased ''that someone has so visibly brought America to her knees.'') Hamid himself straddles two worlds; raised in Pakistan, he attended Princeton and Harvard Law. His wife is a star of ''Jutt and Bond,'' a popular sitcom in Pakistan. ''There's much more fear between Pakistan and America, between the Muslim world and the West,'' Hamid told Terry Gross on NPR. ''The novel reflects and plays on that fear.'' Hamid's previous book, a moody ''Gatsby''-like novel called ''Moth Smoke,'' was reviewed here in 2000 by Jhumpa Lahiri. She liked it a lot, particularly Hamid's ''lean, hip, present-tense'' prose.</p>
        <p>SMOKE RINGS: Paula Deen, the Georgia-based Food Network star, has had best-selling cookbooks before, but this week she's near the top of the nonfiction list with a memoir called ''Paula Deen: It Ain't All About the Cookin'.'' Her book isn't going to put you in mind of Anthony Bourdain's rowdy ''Kitchen Confidential'' or Mary Karr's ''Liars' Club,'' but, thankfully, it's not an entirely bland concoction, either. The book goes down like a handful of sneakily spicy nuts; the heat lingers. Deen writes about her family's feuding, about her agoraphobia, about the time she pointed a gun (unloaded) at her alcoholic first husband, and about her own foul mouth. (Deen boasts that she was the first Food Network star to get bleeped on the air.) It's a little odd, then, that she's so squeamish about another topic: ''I'll tell you something else,'' she writes. ''In all the things that have been written about me, there's something that's been left out of the tellin'. I'm a smoker. There, I said it. Hardly anyone outside my family knows that, and it embarrasses me.'' O.K., she should probably quit. But aren't Southern food and cigarettes, in their way, as venerable a combination as caviar and Champagne?</p>
        <p>UNDER THE RADAR: Twenty-five years ago, in the spring of 1982, Anne Tyler's breakthrough book, ''Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant,'' cracked the Top 15 of the hardcover fiction list. In July 1983, Tyler reviewed, on the Book Review's cover, James Wilcox's classic first novel, ''Modern Baptists.'' It was the kind of rave that can make a career. ''Every reviewer, no doubt, has methods for marking choice passages in a book,'' Tyler wrote. ''Mine is a system of colored paper clips; yellow means funny. 'Modern Baptists' should be thick with yellow paper clips on every page, but it does even better than that. While I was reading it, I laughed so hard I kept forgetting my paper clips. Mr. Wilcox has real comic genius. He is a writer to make us all feel hopeful.'' But somehow it never quite happened for Wilcox, whose subsequent novels, for all their sublime comedy, have flown under the radar. His new one, ''Hunk City,'' is reviewed on Page 34.</p>

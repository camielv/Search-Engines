        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am so glad that The Times has identified and not forgotten that former Gov. Christie Whitman was the original source of the pension mess in New Jersey. Your April 15 editorial ''History's Painful Fallout'' is a rare effort to assign responsibility for the current state of budgetary affairs here.</p>
        <p>I am familiar with the debacle because my wife was and is a pension participant. What soured my insides more than anything else about the mess was the indifference of the Democrats at the time to the very obvious fiscal gimmickry, and the boastful pride the Republicans exhibited at the deliberate decision to not fund the pension because, at the time, it was fully funded and well reserved.</p>

        <p>I am so glad that The Times has identified and not forgotten that former Gov. Christie Whitman was the original source of the pension mess in New Jersey. Your April 15 editorial ''History's Painful Fallout'' is a rare effort to assign responsibility for the current state of budgetary affairs here.</p>
        <p>I am familiar with the debacle because my wife was and is a pension participant. What soured my insides more than anything else about the mess was the indifference of the Democrats at the time to the very obvious fiscal gimmickry, and the boastful pride the Republicans exhibited at the deliberate decision to not fund the pension because, at the time, it was fully funded and well reserved.</p>
        <p>They all (legislators and governor) exhibited and voted their worst instincts during those years, and since then things have only gotten worse in Trenton. What will it take to deliver us from this selfish, short-sighted and dilettante style of governance we now suffer in New Jersey?</p>
        <p>Daniel Wilton  Spring Lake</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It's about time the plain truth came out. I realize that you have space limitations and could not go into it more deeply, but although you mention former Gov. Jim Florio's dip in the polls, it was more serious than that.</p>
        <p>The public reaction to Mr. Florio was pure hate: there is no other way to describe it. He made crucial mistakes for all his excellent intentions, such as the taxes on heavy trucks and paper products, and the revolt against those taxes not only caught fire here in New Jersey but proliferated elsewhere. It became a fever -- almost no one taking a moment to acknowledge the services those taxes were paying for.</p>
        <p>So Christie Whitman rode the waves of that surge of revolt. I said then that some Democrat was going to have to pay dearly -- and here we are.</p>

        <p>GOLDSMITH--Frieda Kittay. The Board of Trustees, management and staff of the Jewish Home &amp; Hospital mourn the passing of a generous benefactor, Frieda Kittay Goldsmith. For over 37 years, Mrs. Goldsmith has supported Kittay House, named in honor of herself and her first husband, Sol Kittay. Since 1970, Kittay House has provided affordable independent living with support services for seniors. Mrs. Goldsmith's thoughtfulness and generosity has enabled Jewish Home to provide the amenities that make a significant difference in the lives of Kittay tenants. She will be warmly remembered by all who had the privilege to know her. We're extremely grateful to Mrs. Goldsmith and send our heartfelt condolences to her son Jeffrey Kittay, her daughter Arlyn Imberman and the entire family. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Kittay House, 2550 Webb Avenue, Bronx, NY 10468. Gene D. Resnick, M.D. Chairman of the Board Audrey S. Weiner, DSW President/CEO $(6$)GOLDSMITH--Frieda Kittay. Cherished wife of the late A. Philip Goldsmith and the late Sol Kittay. An elegant woman and role model of femininity, she brought grace and beauty to all she knew. Fluent in many languages and very much involved in the world of the arts, in particular French history and culture. Her wit sparkled like a jewel and she brought laughter and wisdom through her extraordinary ability as a supreme hostess and raconteur. The world is a lesser place without her. Beloved mother of Jeffrey Kittay and his wife Eva, Arlyn Imberman, and Linda Strulovic; adored grandmother of Sesha and Leo (Kim) Kittay, Thomas and Alberto Strulovic, and Deborah and Liane Radel; dear great grandmother of Micah and Asa Kittay; loving aunt to her nieces and nephews, and special cousin to Eleanor and Robert Sorin. Services 1:00PM Sunday April 22, 2007 at Plaza Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Ave. NYC. In lieu of flowers, contributions in her memory may be made to the Kittay House, 2550 Webb Ave., Bronx, NY 10468.</p>

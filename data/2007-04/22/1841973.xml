        <p>Lately it seems as if black-and-white photography is being discovered for the first time. More than a few galleries have been showing early work from the 1970s by well-known photographers. Whether the interest in this period is nostalgic, with pictures that appear elegiac, or just the next trend, black and white is clearly having a moment. In contrast to the wall-size, super-saturated color photography dominating the market in recent years, the smaller black-and-white images from the 1970s take on the quality of rare, quaint handmade objects.</p>
        <p>On view at PACE MacGILL is a show of work by TOD PAPAGEORGE called ''Passing Through Eden -- Photographs of Central Park.'' From the clothing and hairstyles, the people in these pictures are typical of that era, and they sit on benches, lie on the grass, have picnics, or linger. Most are unaware of the camera, un-self-consciously being who they are.</p>
        <p>Mr. Papageorge, director of Yale's graduate program in photography since 1979, used to go ''shooting'' on the streets of New York a couple of times a week with Garry Winogrand and Joel Meyerowitz in the 1960s. That kind of street photography defined what later came to be called the snapshot aesthetic. Here Mr. Papageorge captured authentic moments on his photography walks through Central Park in the 1970s. Composed with keen observation and not a little wit, his black-and-white pictures seem chiseled from the light, every detail precision-cut; the prints glow as if illuminated from within by the silver of the paper itself. Nostalgia or novelty notwithstanding, they are as pure as photography gets. 32 East 57th Street, Midtown.</p>

        <p>Connecticut prides itself on being green. It claims to have been the first state to open a recycling center. The state has proposed spending millions more to clean up Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>But when it comes to noise pollution, and giving residents some relief from the roar of the highways, Connecticut has given the same answer for more than 15 years: it's not a priority.</p>
        <p>Try telling that to the thousands of people living next to the ever-more-congested Interstates 95 and 91, where the sound of motorcycles speeding up and 18-wheelers downshifting is a constant din.</p>
        <p>In a positive move, the legislature's Joint Committee on Transportation has approved a bill that would authorize a study on where sound barriers are needed the most. The money would enable the Department of Transportation to measure the sound levels in different areas and draw up a priority list, based on noise, of where the walls should go. That is the fairest way to proceed.</p>
        <p>Building the walls does not come cheap. The cost is more than $1 million a mile. But the state has done next to nothing on this issue since 1990. That is when Gov. Lowell Weicker, faced with a huge budget deficit, canceled the program.</p>
        <p>Since then, only those who lived near a highway that was undergoing expansion could qualify for the wooden structures, which are often 15 feet high. In those instances, the state has used federal money to construct the walls.</p>
        <p>When the program ended, there were 131 areas on a waiting list. After a hiatus of 17 years, no doubt even more areas will clamor for help. The initiative is overdue.</p>

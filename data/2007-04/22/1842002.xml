        <p>To the Editor: In the years since I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal, more prestigious positions have opened up, as the ''Why We Travel: West Africa'' (April 8) segment amply demonstrates. Yet the young interviewee's seven-month internship with Human Rights Watch in Dakar, Senegal, seems to have taught her little if anything.</p>
        <p>She refers to a trip she took as ''this crazy loop through West Africa,'' commencing with something she terms a ''ghost train.'' I have taken this same trip, and yes, it is a very tough one, but I do not recall it proceeding at ''about five kilometers an hour.''</p>
        <p>So many people in this young woman's position seem to regard the travel period after their brief -- and apparently meaningless -- internships as a tour through their private preserve during which they can degrade whomever they please.</p>
        <p>And then there is the interviewee's seatmate, whom she flippantly names Madame Crazy. Yes, I have seen aberrant and at times bizarre behavior in Senegal, a land with very little help for mental health problems, and yet it is the home of many proud and generous people.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the possibility that Mme. Crazy might just have had a skin condition, not uncommon in such an arid land, was overlooked. I suffered the same while in the Peace Corps, and would not give my experience there for all the Human Rights internships in the world.</p>

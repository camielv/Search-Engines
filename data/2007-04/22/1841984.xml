        <p>9 P.M. (TV Land) 2007 TV LAND AWARDS -- My how they've, um, grown. The Brady Bunch reunites to receive the Pop Culture Award -- and to mix it up in a song-and-dance routine with Kelly Ripa, second from right above, the ceremony's host -- at this fifth annual tribute billed as ''the ultimate celebration for the TV generation.'' Other nods go to Lucille Ball (the Legacy of Laughter award, accepted posthumously by her children, Lucie and Desi Arnaz Jr.), ''Hee Haw,'' ''Taxi,'' ''Heroes'' (the Future Classic award) and ''Roots,'' in honor of its 30th anniversary. Presenters include Carol Burnett, Valerie Bertinelli, Mackenzie Phillips, Sharon Stone, Morgan Freeman, Kirstie Alley, and Kathy Garver and Johnny Whitaker, a k a Cissy and Jody of ''Family Affair.''</p>
        <p>6:30 P.M. (Fox) EBERT &amp; ROEPER -- The rocker John Mellencamp gives his thumb a workout as guest critic.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) THE SIMPSONS -- After becoming the laughingstock of the P.T.A. when she reveals that she doesn't have an e-mail address, Marge explores the Internet and joins a popular role-playing fantasy game in which Bart turns out to be the most fearsome player.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (13, 49) DOGS THAT CHANGED THE WORLD: THE RISE OF THE DOG -- They display the greatest diversity of any mammal, and yet, from the eensy weensiest Chihuahua to the most overgrown St. Bernard, all dogs have descended from a common ancestor: the wolf. This two-part ''Nature'' special uses new information on canine evolution to examine how the 300 breeds recognized today wound up so different, and why they long ago secured their place as the best-loved animals on the planet.</p>
        <p>8:30 P.M. (Nickelodeon) PRIVATE WORLDS: KIDS AND AUTISM -- ''Nick News With Linda Ellerbee'' checks in on children living with varying degrees of autism. Dr. Temple Grandin, a designer of livestock handling facilities and the author of ''Unwritten Rules of Social Relationships: Decoding Social Mysteries Through the Unique Perspectives of Autism,'' talks about living ''outside the norm.'' Ms. Ellerbee says: ''Autism is not a mental illness. It's not contagious, and it's not a choice. And while kids with autism have been described as living in their own private worlds, they are also living in our world. Therein lies the challenge for all of us: How do we live differently together?''</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (VH1) CELEBRITY FIT CLUB 5 -- Eight overweight celebrities, including Maureen McCormick, Tiffany and Da Brat, try to lose weight for charity.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (CBS) CROSSROADS: A STORY OF FORGIVENESS -- Dean Cain stars in this Hallmark Hall of Fame take on a true story about a man who transforms his yearning for revenge, after his wife and daughter are killed in a crash caused by a teenage street racer, into something more positive. Peri Gilpin plays the lawyer who helps him on his quest.</p>

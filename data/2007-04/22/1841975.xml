        <p>Stephen Petronio has always had a talent for choosing interesting musical partners. Last year he enlisted the singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright for the lyrical ''Bud Suite,'' a work that will be shown again when the STEPHEN PETRONIO COMPANY opens this week at the Joyce. For his most recent piece Mr. Petronio has chosen a song by the avant-garde vocalist Antony, whose ''For Today I Am a Boy'' will be used for a new solo for Davalois Fearon, one of the company's most expressive and appealing dancers. The program also includes ''The Ship Song,'' an extract from Mr. Petronio's recent work for the Sydney Dance Company, and a revival of his 1997 ''ReBourne,'' to music by those avatars of punk-influenced hip-hop, the Beastie Boys. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m., next Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $40.</p>
        <p>The NEW YORK CITY BALLET'S spring season opens Tuesday with a week of 10 all-Balanchine masterworks -- a tribute to its co-founder, Lincoln Kirstein, whose birthday centenary is being celebrated throught the season. After trying out a schedule of fixed programs during the winter, the company appears to have reverted to the model of different combinations of ballets on each night, a relief to those who liked to deliberate over whether to see, say, ''Concerto Barocco,'' ''Duo Concertant'' and ''Symphony in Three Movements'' with ''Square Dance'' (Wednesday night) or with ''The Four Temperaments'' (Thursday). Take note of Kyra Nichols -- the company's reigning ballerina, due to retire at the end of the season -- in ''Pavane'' on Tuesday and Friday nights. And the wonderful Nikolaj Hübbe, recently appointed as the next director of the Royal Danish Ballet, appears in ''Apollo'' (Saturday matinee) and ''Square Dance'' (Wednesday and Friday nights). Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $30 to $86.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night Symphony Space will play host to some 15 contemporary dance, tap, and ballet companies in ''DANCE SAMPLER: FROM TAP TO TOE.'' As ''Fall for Dance'' has proven, mixed bills like this are an enjoyable way to introduce audiences to the kinds of work that may not have been seen before, and to suggest something about the state of the art. For $15 this program, which includes Christopher Williams, Chamber Dance, Hilary Easton and Company and Rumba Tap, is a great deal. 7 p.m., 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org.</p>

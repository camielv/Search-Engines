        <p>Q. If I know that a friend of mine will be arriving late to an appointment, I will save a parking place for her by standing in an open spot and waving away cars nonchalantly. I've heard both arguments: ''You can't do that in New York!'' and ''That's New York!'' What's the rule here?</p>
        <p>A. Forget custom; the city says you can't do it. ''No matter how 'New York' its practitioners claim, those who plant themselves in a parking space in an attempt to reserve it don't have a leg to stand on,'' said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman.</p>

        <p>Q. If I know that a friend of mine will be arriving late to an appointment, I will save a parking place for her by standing in an open spot and waving away cars nonchalantly. I've heard both arguments: ''You can't do that in New York!'' and ''That's New York!'' What's the rule here?</p>
        <p>A. Forget custom; the city says you can't do it. ''No matter how 'New York' its practitioners claim, those who plant themselves in a parking space in an attempt to reserve it don't have a leg to stand on,'' said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman.</p>
        <p>The law is clear, he said in an e-mail message: It is unlawful to try to reserve a parking space, or prevent someone else from taking it, by standing in the spot, using hand signals or placing any objects in the roadway, including unauthorized street signs.</p>
        <p>Doubles, Triples and Cuffs</p>
        <p>Q. At Ebbets Field, where the Brooklyn Dodgers played, there used to be an ad on the outfield fence for Abe Stark's men's clothing store that read, ''Hit Sign, Win Suit.'' Is there any record of how many ballplayers did hit the sign and win a suit?</p>
        <p>A. Tricky answer: There were two Abe Stark signs, and the first was a lot easier to hit than the second, as Bob McGee explained in ''The Greatest Ballpark Ever: Ebbets Field and the Story of the Brooklyn Dodgers'' (2005, Rutgers University Press).</p>
        <p>Abe Stark opened a clothing store on Pitkin Avenue in 1915. He later took over the billboard space in Ebbets Field once occupied by Bull Durham tobacco.</p>
        <p>A onetime Brooklyn outfielder, Overton Tremper, recalled the original Stark sign in the 1920s, which was much bigger than the later one. ''It covered the right field wall,'' Tremper told Mr. McGee, ''top to bottom.''</p>
        <p>Murray Rubin, whose father worked for Abe Stark from 1919 until 1959, was quoted in the book: ''Many balls hit the original Stark sign. My father told me that on some evenings, he altered more suits for players than for paying customers.''</p>
        <p>In 1931, the ''Hit Sign, Win Suit'' ad was moved to a 3-foot high, 30-foot long space under the scoreboard, making it a fiendishly difficult target, especially since the sign had to be hit on the fly to count, and since, later on, right fielders Dixie Walker and Carl Furillo kept Mr. Stark's inventory well protected.</p>
        <p>After the sign change, ''my dad rarely saw any players,'' Murray Rubin said.</p>
        <p>But hitting the sign was not impossible. According to Mr. McGee, Mel Ott of the Giants collected the first two suits in 1931.</p>
        <p>In later years, sign-hitters were surely rare. Pee Wee Reese, who played with Furillo in the '40s and '50s, said that when Furillo was in right field, ''nobody ever hit it.''</p>
        <p>Bumps on the Trees</p>
        <p>Q: Here's a question for spring. Why do so many trees in the parks have large burls on the trunks?</p>
        <p>A: Not to worry, says the Parks Department. Burls -- those round woody growths on the trunks of spruce, birch and other trees -- sometimes weaken trees but do not kill them.</p>
        <p>According to Ashe Reardon, a department spokesman, a burl begins life as a gall, a tumor on plant tissue caused by fungi, insects or bacteria. Evidently, only slight irritation to the bark causes a gall. Once started, the burl grows with the tree.</p>
        <p>An affected tree may grow a single burl or many. Trees with burls seem to be found in clusters. That is suggestive of insects like leafhoppers or aphids transmitting the malady, he said.</p>

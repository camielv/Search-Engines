        <p>It is never easy to stay on top. That is particularly true of scholastic chess programs, where the yearly turnover of students means that any school good enough to win a championship one year could lose its best players to graduation.</p>
        <p>Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn has proved to be an exception. Over the last 15 years, Murrow, which was the subject of a book, ''The Kings of New York,'' because of its success at chess, has won or tied for first in seven national high school championships.

        <p>It is never easy to stay on top. That is particularly true of scholastic chess programs, where the yearly turnover of students means that any school good enough to win a championship one year could lose its best players to graduation.</p>
        <p>Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn has proved to be an exception. Over the last 15 years, Murrow, which was the subject of a book, ''The Kings of New York,'' because of its success at chess, has won or tied for first in seven national high school championships. It secured its latest victory last weekend, tying for first with Catalina Foothills High School in Tucson, Ariz.</p>
        <p>It was the fourth consecutive top finish for Murrow, which also won three in a row from 1992 to '94. During the years that it did not win, Murrow had five top-10 finishes, according to Eliot Weiss, the team's coach and a math teacher at the school. Murrow has had a succession of accomplished players, including Irina Krush, an international master.</p>
        <p>What has kept Murrow on top? Partly it is location, location, location. Brooklyn has long been a magnet for immigrants, with many top players coming from Eastern Europe. In its recent run, Murrow was led by Sal Bercys, who was born in Lithuania, and Alex Lenderman, who came from Russia.</p>
        <p>Weiss said that the team used to be entirely dependent on its Eastern European connections: ''People used to say I should go to Red Square and put up a sign saying 'Murrow High School' or stand at J.F.K. with a sign saying 'Murrow.' '' But he said that was no longer true. Now, he said, the team has players from the Caribbean and some who are American-born.</p>
        <p>Still, the team will face challenges to continue its success because Bercys and Lenderman, both international masters, are graduating.</p>
        <p>Lenderman won individual honors, collecting 6 1/2 out of 7 points to finish first on tiebreaks. He clinched it in the last round by beating Daniel A. Yeager of Pennsylvania, a master.</p>
        <p>The opening was a Slav Defense. The particular system that Yeager chose as White is one that Lenderman does not think much of. ''It gives Black easy equality,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yeager's 9 e3 is rare and rather slow. White usually plays 9 Nbd2 or 9 Nc3 to try to play e4 soon after.</p>
        <p>Instead of 15 cd cd 16 e5, Yeager might have tried 15 Rad1 to maintain the tension in the center.</p>
        <p>Yeager's 19 Qb4 was a mistake, as after 19  Bc2, he was forced to trade queens and then play 21 b4, entombing his dark-squared bishop behind his own pawns, with no hope of counterplay. Instead, he could have tried 19 Qe3, when after 19  Bc2 20 b4, the possibility of being able to attack on the kingside at least gives White some play.</p>
        <p>Once Lenderman invaded on the light squares, Yeager had little hope.</p>
        <p>After 29  R8c2, Yeager could have tried 30 Kf4, but rather than be tortured for the rest of the game, he gave up.</p>

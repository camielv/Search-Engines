        <p>''The fashion of tomorrow has always seemed to me more lovely than the fashion of today,'' wrote Paul Poiret in his 1931 autobiography, ''King of Fashion.'' By then, the designer's illustrious reign had all but faded (he died in 1944 penniless and appropriately bitter), but his heyday in Paris before the First World War would guarantee his legacy. In the simplest of terms, he was a draper rather than a tailor, credited with liberating fashion from an exaggerated corseted silhouette that made a woman look like an hourglass -- or as he put it, as if she were ''hauling a trailer.'' He was also the father of a certain opium-den chic, prone to heady metallic embroideries and the color red, an Oriental streak that was probably attributable to his belief that in a previous life he was an Oriental prince. Now the king is back. A Poiret retrospective opens at the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 9, an event already much anticipated in the fall collections, where his influence was apparent on everyone from Proenza Schouler to Prada. (The clothes on these pages will be hitting the sales floor right about when the show closes on Aug. 5.) All the attention would not have been lost on Poiret, who made little distinction between designer and despot. ''He must follow out his idea, cost what it may,'' he wrote of himself in the third person. ''He will not be followed the first year, but he will be copied the next.'' And the next.</p>

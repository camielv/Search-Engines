        <p>It's not always possible to eat lunch in a historic landmark, and a nationally registered one at that. But at Louis' Lunch you can, even at 1:30 a.m. -- just be sure not to ask for mustard or ketchup.</p>
        <p>Louis' was established in 1895, but its landmark status owes more to the hamburger, which it has been credited with creating in 1900. The diminutive brick building, with diamond-shaped windows, large red shutters and dark wood everywhere inside, appears to have changed little since that event, although it was relocated in 1967 and reassembled brick by brick. It seats about 20 and is operated by Ken Lassen, grandson of the original owner.</p>

        <p>It's not always possible to eat lunch in a historic landmark, and a nationally registered one at that. But at Louis' Lunch you can, even at 1:30 a.m. -- just be sure not to ask for mustard or ketchup.</p>
        <p>Louis' was established in 1895, but its landmark status owes more to the hamburger, which it has been credited with creating in 1900. The diminutive brick building, with diamond-shaped windows, large red shutters and dark wood everywhere inside, appears to have changed little since that event, although it was relocated in 1967 and reassembled brick by brick. It seats about 20 and is operated by Ken Lassen, grandson of the original owner.</p>
        <p>So hamburgers are understandably what Louis' is all about. The beef used is more than 90 percent lean, freshly ground every morning, hand-pressed into large patties and grilled vertically in antique cast-iron broilers. Instead of on buns, the patties are served between toasted slices of white bread, with caramelized onion, a cross-cut of tomato, and cheddar cheese spread. Mustard and ketchup are considered taboo, but feel free to ask for salt. Louis' also serves an eggy potato salad ($3.50) as well as nine different types of potato chips ($1.50 a bag) and soft drinks ($1.50) made by Foxon Park Beverages, an East Haven soda manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Carved initials of generations of patrons mark just about every surface of wood within Louis' -- a clubby, casual flourish reinforced by a reliance on paper plates and napkins, and, for the salad, plastic forks. Burgers, priced at $4.75, are a relative bargain, considering Louis' place in culinary history.</p>
        <p>Louis' Lunch, 261-263 Crown Street, New Haven; www.louislunch.com. or (203) 562-5507. Open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday; noon to 2 a.m. Thursday to Saturday; closed Sunday and Monday, and major holidays. No credit cards accepted.</p>

        <p>Shop Boyz</p>
        <p>In an era when Senator Barack Obama is routinely described as a rock star, do actual musicians still have any claim on the term, or indeed any use for it? Never fear: three Atlantans named Fat, Meanie and Sheed -- known collectively as Shop Boyz -- have formed an exploratory committee. In their raucous hip-hop hit, ''Party Like a Rockstar'' (OnDeck), they cast an admiring eye on that quaint tradition known as rock stardom. Electric guitars provide the treble, a slow-rolling drum machine provides the bass and the three rappers provide the sociological commentary. The call goes out, seven times: ''Party like a rock star!'' Then the nasal response: ''T-t-t-totally, dude.'' Apparently it's a lifestyle defined by golf (''with the Osbournes''), yachting (''with Marilyn Manson'') and surfing (while ''screaming, 'Cowabunga!' ''), as well as ''a skull belt and wallet chain'' and plenty of stage-diving: ''I'm jumping in the crowd just to see if they would carry me.'' The song is already a regional hit. Universal Republic recently signed the trio, hoping to turn ''T-t-t-totally, dude'' into hip-hop's newest catchphrase. The committee's finding: if you really want to party like a rock star, it helps to be a rapper.</p>
        <p>Gowns</p>
        <p>Gurgling electronics. Open-ended folk songs. Jagged buildups. Soft landings. It's hard to get a handle on ''Red State'' (Cardboard), the warm and weird new CD from the Los Angeles-formed, Bay Area-based band called Gowns. The group revolves around a partnership between Erika Anderson, who often plays guitar, and Ezra Buchla, who often plays electronics. In her gently (or ungently) assertive singing and his quietly crazed murmuring, you can hear refracted echoes of punk rants and indie-rock ballads. After about 40 minutes of crashing and flickering, there's a surprise: a halfway garbled song called ''Cherylee'' suddenly mutates into something more forthright. ''You've gotta write down all your symptoms even though it's obscene/You've gotta stay there underwater till you get yourself clean,'' Ms. Anderson sings, and it sounds as though she's shivering.</p>
        <p>Rihanna</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Rihanna was merely the latest young pop star to coo a summer hit (''Pon de Replay'') over a dancehall reggae beat. But her 2006 album, ''A Girl Like Me,'' spun off a series of hits, including the ludicrous but somehow irresistible pop lament ''Unfaithful.'' Apparently she's not done yet: her new single is ''Umbrella'' (Island Def Jam), an icily elegant song built around that singularly inelegant word. There's a serviceable introductory rap by Jay-Z, but the booming backbeat is much more than serviceable. The song was produced by Christopher Stewart, known as Tricky, who augments the beat with something unexpected: a few electro-rock keyboard stabs. (Or is that a keytar?) Rihanna's voice, nimble and cool, is perfectly suited to this sort of thing. ''You can stand under my umbrella,'' she keeps singing, though that last word gets mutated: ''Um-ba-rella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh.'' Ridiculous, in the best sense of the world.</p>
        <p>Stephan Bodzin</p>
        <p>The German producer Stephan Bodzin has spent the past few years tantalizing dance-music fans with singles and remixes. Next month Mr. Bodzin releases his long-awaited debut album, ''Liebe Ist '' (Herzblut), and it's deceptively straightforward: 11 danceable instrumental tracks, all 6 to 8 minutes long, built entirely from computerized plinks and plonks. Each one is a tool, meant to give D.J.'s an artful way to keep people moving. And each one is a little marvel of electronic engineering: the gestures are small, but there are so many that it seems misleading to call Mr. Bodzin a minimalist. ''Meteor'' uses an irrepressible synthesizer figure to nod slyly at the club-conquering genre known as progressive house; ''Fahrenheit'' builds drama from a smudged bass line and a descending arpeggio. Nonclubbers may be pleased to discover that these soothing, spring-loaded tracks have plenty of other uses: this is also music to tidy your room by, music to read by, music to write newspaper articles by.</p>
        <p>Brad Paisley</p>
        <p>He's one of country's most mischievous stars, and (not counting some Christmas songs) he's got a good streak going: his last three singles -- ''When I Get Where I'm Going,'' ''The World'' and ''She's Everything'' -- all topped Billboard's country chart. Perhaps not coincidentally, they were all pretty earnest, which means now it's time for something different: ''Ticks,'' the first single from Mr. Paisley's next album, ''5th Gear'' (Arista Nashville), due out in June. For the hero of this love story, the moonlight rendezvous and the stroll ''through a field of wildflowers'' are merely the prelude; when that's done, he confides, ''I'd like to check you for ticks.'' Mr. Paisley emphasizes the jokes with bawdy guitar licks, but that's not really necessary. All we need is his selfless reminder: ''You never know where one might be.''</p>

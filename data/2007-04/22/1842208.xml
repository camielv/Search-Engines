        <p>The Checking In column last Sunday, about increased hotel development in Lower Manhattan, referred incorrectly to four hotels being developed by the McSam Hotel Group. At 20 Maiden Lane, the hotel will be a Wyndham, not a Holiday Inn Express, and it will have 113 rooms, not 101. At 99 Washington Street, the hotel will be a Holiday Inn with 370 rooms, not 371; it is not unnamed. At 8 Stone Street, a hotel yet to be named will have 400 rooms, not 192; it is not a Doubletree. And at 33 Beekman Street, a hotel yet to be named will have 350 rooms, not 288; it is not a Westin.</p>

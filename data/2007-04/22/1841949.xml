        <p>I am a musician who would like to visit Paris and sing. Any suggestions? -- Catherine O'Brien, St. Pauls, New South Wales, Australia</p>
        <p>There are many options for you, depending on what kind of singing you want to do in Paris. Busking on the Pont St. Louis near Notre-Dame is popular with young musicians from all over.</p>
        <p>For an alcohol-fueled group sing-along that's fun, there are a number of chanson (song) bars where patrons are not only encouraged to sing old French ballads, but are sometimes even handed lyrics at the door. Two solid picks for chanson are Le Vieux Belleville (12, rue des Envierges, 33-1-44-62-92-66; www.le-vieux-belleville.com), in the 20th Arrondissement, and Chez Adel (10, rue de la Grange-aux-Belles; 33-1-42-08-24-61), in the 10th. If you are semiprofessional and want to sing onstage, e-mail your MySpace page to sergei.artistic@wanadoo.fr for a potential spot at La Flèche d'Or (102 Bis, rue de Bagnolet, 33-1-44-64-01-02, www.flechedor.fr), in the 20th.</p>
        <p>A site you may want to check out is the music-minded parisnormal.blogspot.com, which has a list of other indie music-friendly places. In addition to La Flèche d'Or, they say good things about La Maroquinerie (22 rue Boyer, 33-1-40-33-35-05, www.lamaroquinerie.fr) in the 20th and Point Éphémère (200 Quai de Valmy, 33-1-40-34-02-48, www.pointephemere.org) in the 10th.</p>
        <p>If you are a classical singer, you can contact the American Cathedral ( 33-1-53-23-84-00; americancathedral.org), which has a choir and might accept you on a short-term basis. And if none of those options are what you're looking for, you can also post a more specific request at the Paris-based English-language magazine Fusac (French USA Contacts), www.fusac.fr, which has a music category in its ''small ads.''</p>
        <p>When planning your trip, you may want to consider going on June 21 for the Fête de la Musique (fetedelamusique.culture.fr), a festival where amateurs and professionals sing and play in public spaces all over France.</p>

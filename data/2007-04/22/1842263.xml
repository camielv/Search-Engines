        <p>According to the citizens of this small, poor farming town in rural northern Nigeria, hardly one vote was cast in today's historic presidential election.</p>

        <p>According to the citizens of this small, poor farming town in rural northern Nigeria, hardly one vote was cast in today's historic presidential election.</p>
        <p>''They sent us away, all of us,'' said Mikailu Musa, a 40-year-old farmer who had lined up at 10 a.m. to vote for an opposition candidate, but was chased away by young toughs. ''There was no election here.''</p>
        <p>Less than a mile away, official election tally sheets, carted around by heavily armed police officers, told another story -- just about everyone in town had voted, almost all of them for the ruling party.</p>
        <p>''Voting is finished now,'' said one election official, declining to give his name. It was just 2:30 p.m., and balloting was scheduled to continue until 5. But all the ballots had already been marked, he said.</p>
        <p>Thus went Nigeria's presidential election, amid chaos and delay in some parts of the country on Saturday, with a botched attempt to crash a tanker truck into the headquarters of the electoral commission in Abuja, the nation's capital, as well as violent protests and ballot-box snatching.</p>
        <p>Almost everywhere ballots arrived late, and presidential ballots were printed without vital information to identify candidates and prevent fraud.</p>
        <p>Races for legislative seats were postponed for lack of ballots in some places. Voting began late and went very slowly in others. There were widespread reports of shortages of presidential ballots in several states.</p>
        <p>The problems, occurring on the heels of disputed state elections on April 14, raised the possibility that the presidential election might not produce a credible winner, plunging the nation into crisis. And it dimmed hopes that Nigeria could, for the first time, pass power from one fairly elected government to another.</p>
        <p>Voting proceeded peacefully in some areas. In Jos, the capital of Plateau State, which has been racked by interethnic violence for years, voting started late, but polls stayed open to allow everyone in line to cast their ballots, according to election observers.</p>
        <p>But in other places there were serious problems. Here in Dandume, the irregularities pointed to open manipulation of the vote by election workers, accompanied by the police and officials of the governing People's Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that hardly anyone had been seen voting, reported turnout had been high, as much as 100 percent, according to tally sheets, with the vast majority of votes going to the governing party.</p>
        <p>By midafternoon all the ballots here had been used up and bundled into ballot boxes, which were escorted to a counting center by heavily armed policemen. The boxes contained neat stacks of ballots, the vast majority of which appeared to be marked with thumbprints in the governing party's box.</p>
        <p>Inside the counting center, workers hunched over worksheets that contained improbable figures -- in one district, Sayyadi Dispensary, exactly 1000 voters had cast ballots for Senate, and exactly 900 had gone to the ruling party. Muhammadu Buhari's All Nigeria People's Party had won only 20 votes.</p>
        <p>In the presidential voting, far fewer ballots had been reported cast, just 300, suggesting that ballots for president had been in short supply. Most of the tally sheets featured such unlikely round numbers and lopsided results.</p>
        <p>Presidential ballots, printed at the last minute to accommodate a court ruling that required that a leading candidate be reinstated, were in short supply. At one polling station here in a nearby opposition party stronghold, Funtua, just 200 presidential ballots were delivered for 882 registered voters.</p>
        <p>In Rimin Gado, a local government area in the northern state of Kano, the last-minute ballots arrived at a dilapidated schoolhouse a few hours before polls were set to open, but had neither the names nor pictures of the 25 candidates, only their party symbols and party initials. None of the ballots were numbered, either.</p>
        <p>''The lack of numbering is the most problematic issue, because it means there will be no accountability,'' said Abdel Aziz Usman of the Network for Justice, a monitoring group, in Kurami, a northern town.</p>
        <p>Such irregularities will no doubt form part of the legal battles that are likely to follow the election, Nigeria's third since emerging from decades of on-and-off military rule. President Olusegun Obasanjo is stepping down on May 29 after two four-year terms, the most the Constitution allows.</p>
        <p>National police officials said in a news conference in Abuja that men had tried to drive a tanker full of an unidentified substance into the Abuja headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission, which is responsible for the election.</p>
        <p>The driver leapt from the vehicle but left a rock on the accelerator, officials said. The truck crashed, but itdid not explode.</p>
        <p>State elections on April 14 were marred by widespread ballot stuffing, rigging and intimidation in many areas, leading international observers to call for the cancellation of results in as many as 10 of the 36 states. The governing People's Democratic Party won 27 of 36 governorships and state legislatures.</p>
        <p>In Katsina State, there were pockets of violence. In the town of Malumfashi, young supporters of Mr. Buhari set tires afire to block the main road to protest the theft of ballot boxes before anyone was allowed to vote.</p>
        <p>''We have no elections in Nigeria; the politicians just choose who they want,'' said Hamis Lawal, a 22-year-old grade school teacher.</p>
        <p>In the countryside of Katsina, which is the home state of two of the leading presidential contenders, far from the glittering capital and the wealthier coastal regions, it is easy to forget that Nigeria produces more than two million barrels of oil a day and is the second wealthiest nation in Africa.</p>
        <p>The governing party ticket reflects an effort to assuage the grievances of two important parts of the country that feel left out of Nigeria's oil bonanza over the past decade.</p>
        <p>Umaru Yar'Adua, a presidential candidate, hails from Katsina, one of the poorest states in the country, which ranks near the bottom on just about every measure of human development -- child mortality, literacy, life expectancy and income.</p>
        <p>He has a reputation for honesty and competence, but his critics say that he has failed in efforts to develop the state despite a relatively large allotment of the country's shared oil wealth.</p>
        <p>His running mate, Goodluck Jonathan, is the governor of Bayelsa State, part of the oil-rich Niger Delta. He inherited his post after the state's governor was impeached and arrested on charges of stealing public money.</p>
        <p>The former governor spent more than $27 million on a new governor's lodge for himself, even as much of the state lived in darkness because it is not hooked up to the electrical grid. Bayelsa remains one of the poorest and least-developed states in the country, despite its oil bonanza. It gets 13 percent of the value of the oil it produces.</p>
        <p>The main opposition candidates, Vice President Atiku Abubakar and Mr. Buhari, a former military ruler, have mixed records.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abubakar was customs chief during military rule, and like many top government officials, has since amassed a vast fortune that he has explained, cryptically, as coming from ''wise investments.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buhari has a reputation for incorruptibility, but his term as military ruler, from 1983 to 1985, was marked by serious human-rights violations.</p>
        <p>In Funtua, a stronghold of support for Mr. Buhari, when two polling stations finally opened around noon, many people marked their ballots with a thumbprint for Mr. Buhari's All Nigeria People's Party.</p>
        <p>They stood in the shadow of the blackened walls of the magistrates court, which Mr. Buhari's supporters torched after the announcement of results of polling on April 14 was delayed by election officials, raising fears of vote tampering.</p>
        <p>''Things were better when Buhari was our leader,'' said Hajara Yakubu, 60, a grandmother of 18. ''We had security. We did not have corruption.''</p>

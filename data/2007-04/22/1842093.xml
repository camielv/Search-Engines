In all, 1,627 school board seats were available throughout the state and elections were held in 544 districts, according to statistics compiled by the state's Department of Education.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>DESPITE heavy flooding and power failures in some parts of the state, school elections went ahead as scheduled in all but three communities last week, with voters approving 78 percent of the school budgets, up sharply from 52 percent of school budgets approved last year.</p>
        <p>In races for school board seats, there was no shortage of candidates in some corners of New Jersey, like Newark and Jersey City, where the school boards wield little power and serve mainly in advisory roles. But in several places, including some suburban districts like East Windsor in Mercer County and Butler in Morris County, there were fewer candidates than seats available. In all, 1,627 school board seats were available throughout the state and elections were held in 544 districts, according to statistics compiled by the state's Department of Education.</p>
        <p>In Butler, a small borough with about 8,000 residents, there were no candidates at all for an open seat with a one-year term on the school board. Only 28 people took the time to vote, and an accountant and mother of two, Tracy Luciani, 34, won with 15 write-in votes.</p>
        <p>She said she had been mulling a run for several months, but decided to mount her campaign only a week before the election. She will take her seat on the board on Monday. ''I'm not sure what to expect, to be quite honest with you,'' she said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>In East Windsor, there were no candidates on the ballot for a seat with a three-year term. Officials said that might have been the case because it had not been widely publicized that a longtime board member was stepping down. The victorious write-in candidate, Stuart Dolgon, a former board member who has said he will probably not serve, garnered 49 votes (or several more, if votes for ''Stu'' and ''Stu L'' and ''Dalgon'' are counted). Other votes went to ''Bo Bo the Clown'' and ''Rosy Odonnel.''</p>
        <p>Only 14 percent of registered voters showed up on what was a cold, drizzly day last Tuesday. The turnout was down almost two percentage points from last year.</p>
        <p>But this year, a large number of schools that sought voter approval for additional financing beyond their normal spending got the money. According to statistics from the New Jersey School Boards Association, 46 percent of the additional financing requests put before voters won passage, up from 33 percent last year.</p>
        <p>At issue for many towns in New Jersey is the state's financing of schools. While aid was increased this year for the first time in five years with Gov. Jon S. Corzine promising $580 million in new spending, the state provided only 38 percent of total financing to schools, well below the national average of 50 percent, according to the National Education Association.</p>
        <p>''It's quite simple: Additional state aid helps to alleviate the burden on property taxes and promotes community support for the schools,'' said Edwina M. Lee, the executive director of the school boards association.</p>
        <p>Despite the surge in budget approvals, some voters used the election to send a strong message that they are weary of property tax increases. In the regional school district of Princeton (which comprises the borough and the township), voters rejected a spending proposal of $56.2 million -- the first time a budget has been rejected there since 1991. Once a school budget is voted down, it passes to the local town council, which then decides which budget cuts to make.</p>
        <p>THREE districts did not hold elections because of the flooding from last week's storm, according to state officials. Fairfield Township Elementary in Essex County and Bound Brook and Manville in Somerset County postponed elections, the first cancellation of any kind since a snowstorm in 1982 halted elections in North Jersey.</p>
        <p>In Jersey City, Gerald McCann, who served nearly two terms as mayor in the 1980s and early 90s, and was convicted of bank fraud in 1991, won by 21 votes over a candidate backed by the local teachers' union. The losing candidate, Jenny Garcia, said she was planning to challenge the results and was seeking a recount. Mr. McCann did not return calls seeking comment.</p>

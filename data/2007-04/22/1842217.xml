        <p>Mr. Davis, 62, said that it was ''time to introduce younger and more progressive management'' to New Balance, known for offering several widths in its running shoes, and for manufacturing them in the United States, at five sites in Maine and Massachusetts; the company is based in Boston.</p>
        <p>Named as Mr. Davis's successor was Robert T. DeMartini, 45, who was vice president for consumer products at Tyson Foods and has worked at Procter &amp; Gamble and Gillette.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, who has an estimated net worth of $2 billion, will not be idling away his days in retirement. He will remain chairman of the family-owned New Balance, where his wife, Anne Davis, is vice chairwoman.</p>

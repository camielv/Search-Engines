        <p>Truman and Minhee Cho, the founders of Paper + Cup, a graphic design firm in Brooklyn known for its hip, whimsical stationery, see eye-to-eye at work. ''Everything we make, we think of together,'' Ms. Cho said. ''I'm always looking for mundane objects on the sidewalk that I can translate onto paper.'' Her husband, Truman, who also works as a technological engineer at EMI Records, agreed. ''We make napkin drawings at breakfast and dinner,'' he said. ''Minhee comes up with the designs on the computer, and then I pull back the reins because she goes so far out there.'' Simply put, Ms. Cho said, ''He edits me.''</p>
        <p>In terms of wardrobe, it is her husband who could use some editing. ''He owns more than double the clothing that I do,'' said Ms. Cho, 32. ''I usually just wear jeans and a comfortable shirt.'' Here, she wears a Tracy Reese cotton eyelet top, Paige jeans and Chie Mahara shoes. Mr. Cho, also 32, wears an Etro jacket over a Thom Browne shirt and a Dries Van Noten sweater. His jeans are by John Varvatos, and his sneakers are Jack Purcells by John Varvatos. ''Clothes are functional art pieces,'' he said.</p>

        <p>The Chos, who recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary, went to the same elementary school in Orange County, Calif., but didn't start dating until after college. They share a childlike sensibility that clearly influences their designs. ''We're really into kung fu movies right now,'' Ms. Cho said. ''They inspire us to keep things lively.''</p>

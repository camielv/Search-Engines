        <p>Senator Barack Obama of Illinois told several hundred black political organizers yesterday in Manhattan that African-Americans had been ''complicit in diminishing ourselves'' by talking about blacks in the same sort of degrading terms that the radio host Don Imus recently used about the Rutgers women's basketball team.</p>
        <p>''I've heard those words around the kitchen tables,'' Mr. Obama said, speaking to members of the Rev. Al Sharpton's group, the National Action Network at its ninth convention. ''All of us have been complicit in diminishing ourselves, and engaging in the kind of self hatred that keeps our young men and young women down. That's something we have to talk about in this election.''</p>

        <p>Senator Barack Obama of Illinois told several hundred black political organizers yesterday in Manhattan that African-Americans had been ''complicit in diminishing ourselves'' by talking about blacks in the same sort of degrading terms that the radio host Don Imus recently used about the Rutgers women's basketball team.</p>
        <p>''I've heard those words around the kitchen tables,'' Mr. Obama said, speaking to members of the Rev. Al Sharpton's group, the National Action Network at its ninth convention. ''All of us have been complicit in diminishing ourselves, and engaging in the kind of self hatred that keeps our young men and young women down. That's something we have to talk about in this election.''</p>
        <p>Several audience members applauded or nodded; they did, too, when Mr. Obama, who is seeking the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, said he did not want black votes simply because he was black.</p>
        <p>''That's not what America is about,'' he said. ''I want it to be because of what I've done, and how I've lived, and the principles I stand for, and the ideas I promote.'' He promised to improve the public education and health care systems, and affirmed his longstanding opposition to the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>While the audience warmly received Mr. Obama, it was not an especially rousing affair. One of his rivals, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, received more standing ovations when she spoke on Friday to the group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton are competing for the endorsement of Mr. Sharpton, who said he would make his choice among the Democratic field in a few weeks. (John Edwards of North Carolina and other candidates have spoken at the annual convention.)</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton have been courting Mr. Sharpton, Mr. Sharpton's associates said. She has been determined to lock up political and fund-raising support on her home turf, and a Sharpton endorsement would help with her task of vying for black votes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obama and Mr. Sharpton have good ties, but associates of Mr. Sharpton say he feels a natural rivalry with Mr. Obama; Mr. Sharpton ran for president in 2004 and has worked to become an influential and visible leader.</p>
        <p>The Sharpton-Obama-Clinton dynamic was made unusually plain at one point yesterday when Mr. Obama, pausing in his remarks, looked at the podium and said, ''There's something humming down here.''</p>
        <p>''That's Sharpton's BlackBerry,'' Mr. Obama added, and then quickly quipped, ''Is that Hillary calling?''</p>
        <p>As the audience laughed, he said: ''I was just checking. I wasn't sure.''</p>

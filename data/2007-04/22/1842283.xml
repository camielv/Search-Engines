        <p>Every time Alex Rodriguez walks to the plate at Yankee Stadium, the smooth voice of Mims, a rapper from Washington Heights, serenades him for each step and for each practice swing.</p>
        <p>''This is why I'm hot,'' raps Mims, a line that becomes infectious almost instantly. ''This is why I'm hot. This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot.''</p>
        <p>When Rodriguez picked ''This Is Why I'm Hot'' to be his musical anthem, he could not have imagined how snugly it would match his performance. Rodriguez is definitely hot with 12 home runs and 31 runs batted in in his first 16 games, hotter than any major leaguer.</p>
        <p>''I'm the most illiterate music person,'' Rodriguez said. ''Someone told me it was the hottest song.''</p>
        <p>Mims, who grew up on 164th Street and often stared at the Stadium from the roof of his apartment building, said that he was flattered that Rodriguez hears his tune before attacking pitches.</p>
        <p>''I can see why someone would use it,'' Mims said in a telephone interview. ''What is hot? It's all about being confident. For him to hit homers, he's got to be confident.''</p>
        <p>Before there was a Mims, the rapper who wears Yankee caps in his videos, there was a Shawn Mims who loved collecting baseball cards. Mims said he still keeps his cards in his apartment and he still loves the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''People get tired of seeing the Yankees win,'' Mims said. ''Not me. Let them win another one.''</p>
        <p>Though Mims was scheduled to be in Boston this weekend for a charity event, he did not expect to see the Yankees play the Red Sox. Still, Mims had a playful message for Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>''Hey, man, how much is A-Rod making this year?'' Mims said. ''Tell him I'll take a small percentage for being a motivator.''</p>

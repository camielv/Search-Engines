        <p>Editorial credits government at all levels, advocacy groups and private citizens for improving water quality in Long Island Sound; holds much remains to be done and there is never quite enough money for job</p>

        <p>Some people refer to Long Island Sound as the Urban Sea, which by itself is enough to make you nervous. An estimated 20 million people live within a 50 mile drive of its shores, and centuries after the first European explorers came to trade with the Indians, people are still moving to the coasts, eating up open space, trampling wildlife habitats and paving over land in ways that reduce nature's capacity to filter and clean contaminated runoff.</p>
        <p>The remarkable thing is that the Sound is doing as well as it is; though hemmed in by the densest population area in America, this 110-mile-long body of water has, against all odds, remained one of America's great estuaries. Water quality has improved, osprey and striped bass, among other species, have made dramatic recoveries.</p>

        <p>Some people refer to Long Island Sound as the Urban Sea, which by itself is enough to make you nervous. An estimated 20 million people live within a 50 mile drive of its shores, and centuries after the first European explorers came to trade with the Indians, people are still moving to the coasts, eating up open space, trampling wildlife habitats and paving over land in ways that reduce nature's capacity to filter and clean contaminated runoff.</p>
        <p>The remarkable thing is that the Sound is doing as well as it is; though hemmed in by the densest population area in America, this 110-mile-long body of water has, against all odds, remained one of America's great estuaries. Water quality has improved, osprey and striped bass, among other species, have made dramatic recoveries.</p>
        <p>But much remains to be done. Water quality in the Sound's urbanized western end remains only fair to poor; lobster harvests remain perilously low; some tidal marshes are turning into mud flats, for reasons not entirely clear; and water temperature is rising, distressing not only the lobsters but other fish species.</p>
        <p>The main culprit, though not the only one, is nitrogen from urban and agricultural runoff and from the many municipal sewage treatment plants that empty their partially treated wastewater in the Sound and its tributaries. Nitrogen, useful as fertilizer on land, is fatal to water bodies, where it stimulates the growth of bacteria and algae and robs the water of oxygen.</p>
        <p>In 1994, after considerable prodding from the federal Environmental Protection Agency, New York and Connecticut approved a comprehensive cleanup plan, and, in 1998, set a goal of reducing by 58.5 percent the nitrogen reaching the Sound from waste treatment plants in about 80 communities along the Sound and in New York City.</p>
        <p>The results, so far, have been impressive -- a 25- to 30-percent reduction in nitrogen, roughly speaking, a figure that is sure to improve once an agreement struck last year between New York City and Albany to upgrade four plants along the East River kicks in. These plants produce nearly half the nitrogen that enters the Sound, and it is not stretching things to say that failure to live up to this agreement, which will cost the city at least $700 million, could ruin the entire effort.</p>
        <p>Backsliding by the city would also gravely insult the local communities that, at considerable cost, have tried to reduce their own contribution to the problem. Norwalk and Stamford, Conn., have been particularly aggressive in upgrading their treatment plants. Westchester County, which was lagging, has become much more active.</p>
        <p>Congress could also help. Two bills approved in recent years await full funding. One is the Long Island Sound Restoration Act, which authorizes $40 million a year over 5 years in matching grants to help modernize treatment plants. The other is the Long Island Sound Stewardship Act, which President Bush signed last October and which provides $25 million a year in matching funds for the acquisition of open space essential to the health of the Sound. Funding these programs would provide not only a financial but psychological boost to the local communities to whom the cleanup job has largely been entrusted.</p>

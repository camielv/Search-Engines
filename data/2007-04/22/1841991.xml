        <p>Shostakovich: Violin Concertos Nos. 1, 2  Sergey Khachatryan, violinist; Orchestre National de France, conducted by Kurt Masur. Naïve V 5025; CD.</p>
        <p>WHILE not yet staples, the two violin concertos by Shostakovich are steadily claiming places in the repertory. There are many fine recordings, including those by the great violinist for whom they were written, David Oistrakh.</p>
        <p>Still, a new recording of both works performed by the young Armenian violinist Sergey Khachatryan, with Kurt Masur conducting the Orchestre National de France, is an exciting addition to the catalog. Beyond the technical excellence and stylistic sensitivity of the performances, the brilliant Mr. Khachatryan (who was born in 1985), Mr. Masur and the accomplished orchestra powerfully convey the dusky, rich and weighty sound world of this music, though the recording engineers surely deserve some credit for the results.</p>
        <p>The Concerto No. 1 in A minor, the better-known work, is one of Shostakovich's most unorthodox and volatile compositions. After finishing it in 1948, Shostakovich, then in disfavor with the Soviet cultural police, withheld it until a more relaxed climate allowed its premiere with the Leningrad Philharmonic in 1955. It is written in four strangely gripping movements. A pensively lyrical Nocturne is followed by a fitfully grotesque Scherzo with a staggeringly difficult violin part. Then a tragic Passacaglia leads to a ruminative and consoling solo cadenza, before the work concludes with a Burlesque whose aggressively upbeat energy is at once astounding and disturbing.</p>
        <p>The Concerto No. 2 in C sharp minor, from 1967, is a more modest work in three movements with a somber and steady Moderato, a reflective Adagio and a brusque finale. But in this inexorable and arresting performance, the music teems below its deceptively Neo-Classical surface.</p>
        <p>The tousle-haired and charismatic Mr. Khachatryan, who two years ago won the Queen Elisabeth competition in Brussels, increasingly seems a major artist. He has been a particular favorite of Mr. Masur's. They make dynamic partners here.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a retired music theater educator, I read ''Calling All Jocks and Brainiacs Onstage'' (April 15), about ''High School Musical,'' with encouragement and a little dismay. Getting students involved in music theater yields many secondary benefits such as building self-esteem, being part of a group enterprise and even some improvement of study skills and grades. But it should also be meeting some primary artistic and educational goals as well.</p>

        <p>As a retired music theater educator, I read ''Calling All Jocks and Brainiacs Onstage'' (April 15), about ''High School Musical,'' with encouragement and a little dismay. Getting students involved in music theater yields many secondary benefits such as building self-esteem, being part of a group enterprise and even some improvement of study skills and grades. But it should also be meeting some primary artistic and educational goals as well.</p>
        <p>It is commendable that these arts educators are taking into account where the students are. But one also hopes that they also move on to provide their students with artistic experiences beyond what is simply facile and commercially popular. Parents should encourage and even demand such artistic quality as well.</p>
        <p>I hope that two years from now these schools have used this experience to develop music theater programs that present works that truly challenge students. These programs can become be a vital and stimulating part of the school community and can offer students something that Disney and the rest of the mall culture cannot.</p>

        <p>New York City Councilman Tony Avella, who is also chairman of Council's zoning committee, is battling Department of Buildings over complaint that his backyard swimming pool in Whitestone, Queens, violates city's zoning rules; photo (S)</p>

        <p>In a corner of the small backyard behind his two-story house in Whitestone, Queens, City Councilman Tony Avella has an aboveground pool. He opens it each year around Memorial Day, holds family gatherings around it in summer, and covers it during the off-season with a blue tarp weighed down by detergent bottles filled with water.</p>
        <p>The pool, which is about 12 feet in diameter, sits no more than two feet from Mr. Avella's backyard fence, where it, or the pool that preceded it, has sat since he and his wife moved in 15 years ago. To Mr. Avella's chagrin, however, the placement of the pool violates the city's zoning rules, specifically a ''quality of life'' requirement that all pools behind one- or two-family houses must be at least five feet from the lot line. The issue was reported in The Queens Tribune, a weekly paper.</p>

        <p>In a corner of the small backyard behind his two-story house in Whitestone, Queens, City Councilman Tony Avella has an aboveground pool. He opens it each year around Memorial Day, holds family gatherings around it in summer, and covers it during the off-season with a blue tarp weighed down by detergent bottles filled with water.</p>
        <p>The pool, which is about 12 feet in diameter, sits no more than two feet from Mr. Avella's backyard fence, where it, or the pool that preceded it, has sat since he and his wife moved in 15 years ago. To Mr. Avella's chagrin, however, the placement of the pool violates the city's zoning rules, specifically a ''quality of life'' requirement that all pools behind one- or two-family houses must be at least five feet from the lot line. The issue was reported in The Queens Tribune, a weekly paper.</p>
        <p>Mr. Avella, who has already announced his candidacy for mayor in 2009, is not simply a councilman. He is chairman of the Council's zoning committee and one of the loudest foes of the Department of Buildings.</p>
        <p>The violation carries a fine of up to $2,500; because he contested the charge at a hearing of the Environmental Control Board this month, the maximum fine would be $400. Still, his predicament struck him as a little silly.</p>
        <p>''I can't get the D.O.B. to go after the real unscrupulous developers,'' Mr. Avella said one morning last week as he stood next to the pool. ''And this is who they go after.''</p>
        <p>The violation, which came in response to an anonymous complaint, was issued in November 2005, but the hearing was pushed back until this April 10, as Mr. Avella was initially in talks with the agency to resolve the issue without a hearing, he said. After the hearing, he held a press conference in his backyard.</p>
        <p>''It's a ridiculous, arbitrary rule,'' he said, ''and D.O.B. can't come up with a reason why it exists.''</p>
        <p>Kate Lindquist, a department spokeswoman, said the rule was adopted in the 1960s to keep swimmers' noise and splashed water away from neighbors' yards.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Avella's high profile, she said, the agency planned to treat his case like any other. ''When a complaint comes in,'' Ms. Lindquist said, ''we respond to the complaint.''</p>
        <p>A decision is expected within a few months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Avella predicts that he will lose. If that happens, he said, he will most likely sue the city to draw more attention to the rule and get it changed or abolished, an action that would require approval from the City Planning Commission.</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome, he added, the pool will remain where it is for the time being. ''For me, it's the issue,'' Mr. Avella said, ''and not just going along.''</p>

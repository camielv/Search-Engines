        <p>Anchoring the Sound end of Mamaroneck's busy main street, the Tea House could not be in a more convenient location. A perfect stop for a restorative, unhurried cuppa and much more, this charming spot is around the corner from the Emelin Theater, down the block from the movie house, and a short stroll across Boston Post Road from the boatyard and from pretty Harbor Island Park.</p>
        <p>The front of the shop is roomy and serene, fitted out like a relaxing garden room, with plants, a dozen glass-topped tables and cushioned wicker chairs. Bring a book, or leaf through the pile of magazines, while you wait for your fresh juice or smoothie, cappuccino or chai ($6 to $10 for a two-cup pot).</p>

        <p>The front of the shop is roomy and serene, fitted out like a relaxing garden room, with plants, a dozen glass-topped tables and cushioned wicker chairs. Bring a book, or leaf through the pile of magazines, while you wait for your fresh juice or smoothie, cappuccino or chai ($6 to $10 for a two-cup pot).</p>
        <p>Or you may want to cruise the back of the shop, where almost two dozen jars of loose teas from China, India, even the Caucasus, line the shelves. Shekhar Bose, the owner, is usually in the shop and is pleased to discuss the provenance and characteristic of a particular tea and will try to match a tea to a customer's taste.</p>
        <p>Fresh muffins, cakes and cookies are on hand to go with the beverages, but more substantial items are available as well, like mulligatawny or cream of wild mushroom soup ($5.25); vegetable samosas (two for $5); quiche; and soft, warm nan wraps ($9) enclosing tandoori chicken, beef kebab or vegetable.</p>
        <p>In addition to the loose teas, packaged blends of teas -- many from Bromley -- and sacks of La Colombe coffee blends pack the shelves. Bottles of assorted chutneys and bars of chocolate are also for sale. Any of the dozens of lovely pots and tea sets on display would make a nice gift for tea-drinking friends.</p>
        <p>The Tea House, 143 Mamaroneck Avenue, Mamaroneck; (914) 381-8019. Open Tuesday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Sunday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.</p>

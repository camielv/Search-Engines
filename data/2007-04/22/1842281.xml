        <p>Tough to Hit  Mark Buehrle of the White Sox, who no-hit Texas in his last start, is scheduled to start tomorrow against Kansas City. Johnny Vander Meer, with the Reds in 1938, is the only pitcher to throw no-hitters in consecutive starts. Vander Meer no-hit the Boston Bees, 3-0, on June 11, then no-hit the Dodgers, 6-0, on June 15. Vander Meer pitched 21 consecutive hitless innings that season.</p>
        <p>A Baseball Hat Trick  Last Monday, first baseman Aubrey Huff of the Orioles could not handle a spinning grounder hit by B. J. Upton of the Devil Rays, then overthrew first base on the same play. Baltimore catcher Paul Bako, who was backing up first, grabbed the wild throw and threw wildly as Upton advanced to third. The last time a team made three errors on a single play was on May 23, 1998, when the Astros did it against the Padres.</p>
        <p>It Could Be Worse  Players off to slow starts at the plate should take solace. Richie Scheinblum, with the 1969 Indians, went 0 for 30 in April.</p>
        <p>Watch List  Toronto's Aaron Hill is having a good year in average (.306) and runs batted in (11). While Hill improved his average by 17 points with nearly 200 more at-bats in his second season last year, he does not figure to compete for a batting title any time soon. He will not face the Royals' pitching staff again for a while, either. After going 7 for 11 in three games against Kansas City, he was 5 for his last 27 and on his way back to earth.</p>
        <p>The Cubs' Rich Hill is 3-0 with a 0.41 earned run average. The left-handed Hill, 27, has used a dominant curveball to strike out 18 in 22 innings. In his first 14 big-league appearances in 2005 and 2006, he had a 9.20 E.R.A. But his current results correspond with his minor league numbers, when he averaged more than 12 strikeouts per nine innings.</p>
        <p>Long labeled a top prospect, Wilson Betemit survived the Dodgers' experiment with Julio Lugo last year and is their starting third baseman. How has he responded? By getting 5 hits in his first 38 at-bats. If Betemit cannot find his stroke, the Dodgers could give up on their plans of switching the top prospect of the moment, Andy LaRoche, to the outfield.</p>

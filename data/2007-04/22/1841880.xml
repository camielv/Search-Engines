        <p>HOCH--Frank W. The Phelps Memorial Hospital Center community mourns the passing of long-time friend, Frank W. Hoch, who was associated with the Hospital since 1968. He served on The Phelps Board of Directors for 15 years, including a term as Chairman. He was instrumental in the planning and funding of the expanded Emergency Training Center, which will be located in Phelps' new Medical Services Building. The Emergency Training Center will carry the Hoch name, serving as a reminder of Frank and Lisina Hoch's extraordinary support over many decades. We extend our deepest condolences to Frank's devoted wife Lisina, his children Steven, Alix, Daphne, and Roland, and the entire Hoch family. C. Edward Midgley, Chairman, Bd of Dir; Keith F. Safian, President and CEO; Elio Ippolito, M.D., President of the Medical Staff.</p>

        <p>EDGAR ALLAN POE &amp; THE JUKE-BOX: Uncollected Poems, Drafts, and Fragments, by Elizabeth Bishop. Edited and annotated by Alice Quinn. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $15.) Although she published only some 90 poems in her lifetime, Elizabeth Bishop (1911-79), one of the most respected of American poets, won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. She was gay, an alcoholic, an expatriate and essentially an orphan, but her poems -- intimate without being self-revelatory -- hid the harrowing nature of her life. ''Edgar Allan Poe &amp; the Juke-Box'' is a collection of previously unpublished poems and prose pieces culled by Alice Quinn, poetry editor of The New Yorker, from Bishop's papers at Vassar College. Our reviewer, David Orr, called Quinn's notes ''superb'' and said some of the poems here ''can stand alongside anything The New Yorker got its hands on back in the 1950s or '60s.''</p>
        <p>NEWS OF PARIS: American Journalists in the City of Light Between the Wars, by Ronald Weber. (Ivan R. Dee, $16.95.) This is a richly anecdotal history of the American newspaper people -- Ernest Hemingway and Henry Miller among them -- who flocked to Paris during the 15 years after the armistice that ended World War I. A WRITER AT WAR: A Soviet Journalist With the Red Army, 1941-1945, by Vasily Grossman. Edited and translated by Antony Beevor and Luba Vinogradova. (Vintage, $15.95.) As a special correspondent for the Soviet Army's newspaper, the novelist Vasily Grossman chronicled everything from the German advance across Ukraine to the final push into Berlin. In ''A Writer at War,'' Antony Beevor, a British historian, combines excerpts from Grossman's notebooks with lucid historical commentary to tell the story of the war through Grossman's eyes.</p>
        <p>THE ACCIDENTAL, by Ali Smith. (Anchor, $13.95.) Smith's novel -- which won Britain's Whitbread Book Award and was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize -- concerns an attractive, enigmatic stranger who is taken in by an unhappy family and exposes the secrets and desires of its members, one by one.</p>
        <p>SWEET AND LOW: A Family Story, by Rich Cohen. (Picador, $14.) Cohen's rollicking account of his family and the business it built begins with his grandfather, who invented the sugar substitute Sweet'N Low, which went on sale in its iconic pink packets in 1957. Cohen, whose branch of the family was disinherited in a power struggle, tells of the gradual unraveling of the family and its fortune, and detours through the histories of sugar, dieting, packaged foods and Jews in New York. In the Book Review, Kate Zernike said Cohen, the author of ''Lake Effect'' and ''Tough Jews,'' has ''a terrific eye for detail, the little things that affix people and places in our memories, the gestures and miscues that shape family history.''</p>
        <p>WHERE GOD WAS BORN: A Daring Adventure Through the Bible's Greatest Stories, by Bruce Feiler. (Harper Perennial, $14.95.) In his books ''Walking the Bible'' (2001) and ''Abraham'' (2002), and again in ''Where God Was Born,'' Feiler -- accompanied by an Israeli archaeologist -- visits biblical sites throughout the Middle East, rereading the scriptural episodes that took place there.</p>
        <p>MILK, by Darcey Steinke. (Bloomsbury, $9.95.) Steinke's idiosyncratic fourth novel explores sexual and religious obsession through the intertwined lives of three Brooklyn outcasts: Mary, a new mother transformed by the birth of her baby; her friend, Walter, a lonely gay Episcopal priest; and John, a lapsed monk who craves intimacy with a woman.</p>
        <p>HOUSE THINKING: A Room-by-Room Look at How We Live, by Winifred Gallagher. (Harper Perennial, $14.95.) From Thomas Jefferson at Monticello through California's mid-20th-century Case Study houses, Gallagher, author of ''The Power of Place,'' gives a room-by-room architectural history and presents enlightening stories about how people choose to organize their belongings.</p>
        <p>SKINNER'S DRIFT, by Lisa Fugard. (Scribner, $15.) Fugard, the daughter of the South African playwright Athol Fugard, tells two stories in her riveting first novel. The first is the tale of a South African family farming in the 1980s near the Limpopo river: Martin van Rensburg, a stuttering, hard-drinking Afrikaner; his sensitive English wife, Lorraine; and their daughter Eva, who grows up loving and hating the farm. Fugard also adopts the point of view of the African laborers to help tell a larger tale of race, class, injustice and the corrosive legacy of apartheid in South Africa.</p>
        <p>SOUND AND FURY: Two Powerful Lives, One Fateful Friendship, by Dave Kindred. (Free Press, $15.) An honest, affectionate dual biography of the oddest couple in sports -- Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell -- ''Sound and Fury'' portrays both men as modern-day Columbuses, each amplifying the other's fame.

        <p>Gunmen killed the chairman of the Falluja City Council on Saturday, striking a blow to American and Iraqi efforts to develop a functioning representative government in the volatile western province of Anbar.</p>
        <p>Sami Naib al-Jumaili, who was slain in a drive-by shooting in front of his house, was at least the third leader of the Falluja City Council killed by insurgents. Another resigned after receiving death threats.</p>
        <p>Though police investigators said they did not know who killed Mr. Jumaili, suspicion has fallen most heavily on the extremist insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, which has conducted an intimidation and murder campaign against politicians and tribal leaders in Anbar who have cooperated with the Iraqi and American authorities.</p>
        <p>Maj. Jeffrey Pool, a spokesman for the American military command in Falluja, said the assassination was ''designed to cause fear and to intimidate the populace to cow them into submission.''</p>
        <p>In the northern oil city of Kirkuk, gunmen stormed the house of a Kurdish family on Saturday, killing all four family members, including an 8-year-old girl who was beheaded, according to Brig. Gen. Adel Zain al-Abdeen, the chief of the local police.</p>
        <p>Police investigators and neighbors of the victims said they had no idea why the attackers had singled out the family, which included the girl's parents and her 18-year-old sister.</p>
        <p>Killings have been on the rise in Kirkuk in recent months as tensions have escalated between Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen in advance of a referendum, expected to be held before the end of the year, to decide whether the city should join Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>
        <p>Also on Saturday, three American soldiers were killed and six were wounded in three separate attacks in and around Baghdad, the American military said. The military also reported that a Polish soldier was killed and four were wounded when their vehicle was struck by a bomb Friday on a roadway in Diwaniya, south of the capital.</p>
        <p>In Baghdad, a car bomb exploded in the Shiite enclave of Sadr City on Saturday, killing two and wounding five, an Interior Ministry official said.</p>
        <p>A volley of at least six mortar shells exploded in and around the capital's fortified International Zone on Saturday afternoon, wounding at least two people, the Interior Ministry official said.</p>
        <p>An official in Adhamiya, a predominantly Sunni Arab neighborhood in Baghdad, lashed out at the Americans on Saturday for their decision to build a 12-foot wall along the eastern flank of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Daood Salman al-Adami, acting head of the Adhamiya council, said that the American military had asked him to sign a document assenting to the wall before they began construction last week, but that he refused to do so until he had polled the community.</p>

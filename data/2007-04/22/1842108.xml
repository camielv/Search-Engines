        <p>CANADA'S government regularly steps in when major artworks are sold to foreigners. Now a 1905 Ford Model C is caught up in the country's control over cultural property exports.</p>
        <p>The car was made by Ford Motor of Canada in its first year of operation, in what is now Windsor, Ontario. For 29 years, the Model C has been on loan to the Canadian Transportation Museum in nearby Essex.</p>
        <p>Because the car is a direct link to the beginning of what became Windsor's dominant industry, it has been an important part of the museum. Mickey Moulder, the museum's co-chairman, said the institution did not know the car was a protected icon. ''It was a surprise,'' said Mr. Moulder, a retired manager for Ford Canada. ''We didn't know it had anything to do with culture.''</p>
        <p>The Model C's newfound status followed the recent death of the car's 92-year-old owner, Ted Dudley. Mr. Moulder said the museum could not match a $75,000 offer for the car that Mr. Dudley's estate received from a collector in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>After The Windsor Star newspaper reported that the car was moving on this summer, the Canadian government took notice and said the Ford could not leave Canada without a cultural property export permit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moulder said that he had never heard of that requirement and added that vintage cars regularly roll out of Canada without permits. But Len Westerberg, a spokesman for the Department of Canadian Heritage, said any vehicle more than 50 years old with a value of more than 3,000 Canadian dollars needed an export permit.</p>
        <p>If the estate decides to proceed with the sale and applies for a permit, a number of steps can occur. Most likely, the government will give Canadians two months to four months to produce a matching offer that would keep the car in the country. Ford Canada owns the only other known Canadian-made Model C.</p>

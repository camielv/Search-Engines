        <p>Long Beach Condo  $879,000</p>
        <p>NASSAU: 260 West Broadway</p>
        <p>A two-bedroom, two-bath condo on the fifth floor of the Meridian, a new oceanfront building with 24-hour concierge service and a pool. Two indoor parking spaces and a one-year membership at a nearby gym are included. Barbara Ruotolo, Topper Realty (516) 286-9527; www.topperrealestate.com</p>
        <p>COMMON CHARGE: $384 a month; taxes: $12,000 a year</p>
        <p>PROS: The building is next to the boardwalk and the beach, and within walking distance of the train station.</p>
        <p>CONS: The terrace is on the side of the building, so the ocean view comes with a parking lot in the foreground.</p>
        <p>Arts and Crafts Bungalow  $1,199,000</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN: 678 East 22nd Street (near Farragut Road)</p>
        <p>A detached house near Brooklyn College with five bedrooms, one full and two half baths, a garden, a deck, a garage and a porch. Brooklyn Properties (718) 788-3888; www.Brooklynproperties.com. Open house, Saturday and Sunday, 12 to 2 p.m.</p>
        <p>TAXES: $2,942 a year</p>
        <p>PROS: Meticulously restored inside and out, this perfectly proportioned house has the original center staircase, leaded glass windows, beamed ceilings, a decorative mantel and a butler's pantry as well as an updated eat-in kitchen.</p>
        <p>CONS: There is only one full bath.</p>
        <p>Upper East Side Condo  $925,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 225 East 86th Street (between Second and Third Avenues), #1203</p>
        <p>A one-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath unit with a washer/dryer in a doorman building. Lauren Zidel (212) 585-4558, Iris Klatsky (212) 452-4407, Stribling &amp; Associates; www.stribling.com</p>
        <p>COMMON CHARGE: $1,156 a month; taxes: $825 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: The apartment has open city views, which can best be appreciated from the spacious terrace, and a dining solarium. A walk-in closet and additional built-ins provide plenty of storage.</p>
        <p>CONS: Some buyers might find the layout, which is spread out over four levels, a bit too quirky.</p>
        <p>Waterfront Contemporary  $2,295,000</p>
        <p>CONNECTICUT: 274 Pine Creek Avenue, Fairfield</p>
        <p>A five-year-old cypress-clad contemporary designed by Roger Ferris &amp; Partners with two large bedrooms, two and a half baths, floor-to-ceiling built-ins, gas fireplace and radiant-heat floors. Charles Zylstra, Nicholas H. Fingelly Real Estate (203) 257-5727, www.fingelly.com</p>
        <p>TAXES: $19,180 a year</p>
        <p>PROS: The angled spaces make this house visually arresting. Horizontal cypress louvers and remote-controlled shades afford privacy.</p>
        <p>CONS: The house would not lend itself to a third bedroom. Although the garage holds two cars, it is of older construction and is across the street.</p>
        <p>Garment District Loft  $1,795,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 28 West 38th Street (between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas), #3W</p>
        <p>A two-bedroom, two-bath floor-through co-op with a washer and dryer for sale by the owner, a broker. Jim Gricar, Brown Harris Stevens (212) 588-5660; www.brownharrisstevens.com</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $1,943 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: This airy loft is made for entertaining. The living room has a built-in media system that includes a 72-inch flat-screen digital television. The open kitchen comes with Viking appliances, a walk-in pantry and two-inch-thick marble counters. In addition to the dining area, there is a lounge area that could be converted to a small third bedroom. The bathrooms have been sleekly renovated with limestone and bluestone tile.</p>
        <p>CONS: The bedrooms face south onto a construction site, where a 10-story office building is being built.</p>

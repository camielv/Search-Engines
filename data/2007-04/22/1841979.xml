        <p>The lineage of dogs can be traced to wolves; we know that. But according to the novel work of the Swedish geneticist Peter Savolainen, who analyzed DNA from breeds around the world, dogs can be traced to a point of single origin in East Asia thousands of years ago. In a two-part PBS series beginning on Sunday (and continuing next Sunday) ''Nature'' presents ''DOGS THAT CHANGED THE WORLD,'' a look at the species, from its evolutionary history to the impact it is making on 21st-century medical care.</p>
        <p>Dogs, dogs and more dogs. A golden retriever puppy named Thomas takes center stage in the BBC America movie ''AFTER THOMAS,'' which makes its debut on Sunday at 8 p.m. The film, based on a true story, deals with a young couple struggling to raise an autistic son. The father would like to place the boy in a good boarding school to help him. The mother resists. The marriage is strained. But things begin to improve immeasurably for the child with the arrival of Thomas, who can reach the boy in a way that no mere human can.</p>
        <p>A telepathic person, a brilliant person, a stripper, a man who can stop time -- these are a few of the strangely connected characters who have made the NBC drama ''HEROES'' so compelling. The fate of the world confronts them when the series returns on Monday at 9 p.m.</p>

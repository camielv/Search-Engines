        <p>HARTMAN--John Wheeler. Management, Innovator, Author, Philanthropist. John Wheeler Hartman of Ocean Reef, Key Largo, Florida, died on April 5th, 2007 at the age of 84. He was predeceased by his wife of 56 years, Esther Kelly Bill Hartman. In 1946.

In 1975, Mr. Hartman introduced the publishing industry's first decentralized participatory management plan and Employee Stock Ownership Trust. Bill employees at all levels were encouraged to make management contributions and decisions. Several of Mr. Hartman's unconventional innovations, such as his ''Bottoms Up Management'' theory, remain to this day as case studies at Harvard's Business School.

He has authored nine books including More Second Thoughts and Maverick Management. He later became a contributing columnist to other publications, such as Advertising Age, Business Marketing, and the Ocean Reef Free Press.

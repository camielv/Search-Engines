        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was very interested in your article about the statues formerly on the facade of the Exchange Court building (Streetscapes, April 1). In the mid- or late 1950s, my father came home one day and announced, ''I have found General Wolfe.'' He packed us in the car and took us to a junkyard in Brownsville.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was very interested in your article about the statues formerly on the facade of the Exchange Court building (Streetscapes, April 1). In the mid- or late 1950s, my father came home one day and announced, ''I have found General Wolfe.'' He packed us in the car and took us to a junkyard in Brownsville.</p>
        <p>There, looking through a high fence, we saw the top of a very large bronze statue. Dad told us he was just passing by -- he worked for Con Ed in that district -- and recognized the statue. My brothers remember the incident, but, like me, never expected to learn anything more. Thank you for clearing up an old mystery. Maybe I'll see it again if I ever go to Calgary.</p>

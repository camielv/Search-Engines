        <p>RADWELL--Jeanne, 86, died at home peacefully on April 16, 2007, surrounded by loved ones. She was adored, admired and respected by a large, loving extended family, by friends, old and new, and by most gracious caretakers. Her loss will be felt by her daughters Laura and Amy and son-in-law Chick, her grandsons Zachary, Luke and Dylan, Jason and his wife Christine, her great-granddaughter Zarah-Louise, sister Shoy and brother-in-law Norman and sister-in-law and brother-in-law Shirley and Sam. Blessed by a 50 year marriage to the late Louis Radwell, she lived her life with grace, compassion, and a genuine interest in those around her. She elegantly endured life's travails with a strong spirit and sense of joy. We mourn an accomplished, inspirational woman of unfailing warmth and wit. Donations can be made to Comprehensive Community Hospice, 1 Delaware Drive, Lake Success, NY 11042.</p>

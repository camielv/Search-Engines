      <block class="full_text">
        <p>TAXPAYERS in a group of Nassau County school districts where property taxes are high, and incomes generally are not, are among those who stand to gain the most from the record $23 billion in state aid and tax relief that Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the State Legislature agreed to in the new budget this month.</p>
        <p>The Carle Place School District will get a 20 percent increase in combined state aid and School Tax Relief, or STAR, the state rebate program for homeowners. Hicksville will receive 5 million new dollars for its schools and taxpayers. West Hempstead will get $1.2 million in new aid and $1.3 million in new STAR rebates.</p>
        <p>''We fit that little niche where our taxpayers pay high property taxes but their relative income is not at the top tier,'' said W. Michael Mahoney, the superintendent in Carle Place. His district's windfall is nearly twice the 11 percent average increase statewide.</p>
        <p>''We're thankful for it,'' Mr. Mahoney said. ''It allows us to reach out to our taxpayers and keep the tax levy down.''</p>
        <p>Detailed projections by the governor's office of the budget's impact on each of the state's 672 school districts show that the biggest winners receive the full impact of two new initiatives: a tax rebate program whose benefits diminish as income climbs, and a new category of state aid for counties with high tax rates that mostly benefits Long Island.</p>
        <p>Some wealthy districts on the East End of Suffolk, like Bridgehampton, Southold and Hampton Bays, also get big increases.</p>
        <p>The projections show that some of the biggest losers, on the other hand, are affluent districts in Westchester County. Places like Chappaqua, Briarcliff Manor and Byram Hills have many homeowners who do not qualify for the new STAR rebates. The rebates decline for taxpayers as their adjusted gross incomes rise above $120,000, and are eliminated for those with incomes of more than $250,000.</p>
        <p>Most Westchester districts also do not qualify for the new class of state aid to high-tax counties. Under the program, produced in last-minute budget negotiations, districts in Nassau and Suffolk split $70 million, while Westchester got just $1.2 million.</p>
        <p>Democratic Assembly members have called the program retribution by the Republican majority in the Senate for the defeat last year of a Republican state senator from Westchester, Nicholas A. Spano. Republican legislators have denied acting out of revenge.</p>
        <p>Altogether, the April 1 budget deal between the Legislature and the governor largely canceled out any major redistribution of education funding. The regional status quo that has guided the distribution of state aid for decades shifted only slightly: New York City will get a larger slice of the $23 billion pie than it received last year -- 36.7 percent compared with 36.5 percent. So will Long Island -- 14.3 percent of the total next school year compared with 14.2 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Westchester's share will remain the same next year, 4.4 percent, while the share going to upstate districts will fall, to 42.9 percent from 43.3 percent.</p>
        <p>''There are two factors that really drove aid downstate,'' said Paul Francis, the governor's budget director. ''One is that by sending more money to high-needs districts, that's going to drive more money downstate because of New York City and certain suburban districts. The other is that a disproportionate amount of aid that was directed in the final negotiations went to New York City and Long Island.''</p>
        <p>Some groups had hoped to see the state spend more on poorer districts, and there was a small movement in that direction. In addition to New York City's increase, suburban districts that the state classifies as poor, or high need, will also get slightly more in aid, 8.8 percent of the total compared with 8.7 percent last year. This category includes districts in Mount Vernon, Peekskill, Hempstead, Roosevelt and Wyandanch.</p>
        <p>But the STAR program and high-tax aid also shifted money toward districts with the lowest needs. That category, which includes most districts in Westchester and Long Island, will get 8.4 percent of the total package next year, up from 8.2 percent this year.</p>
        <p>''You can say both sides won,'' said Geri D. Palast, executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, which has sued the state to force it to spend more money in New York City. Ms. Palast said her group was happy because more money was being spent in the city, and because the state passed a formula for aid that, if followed, would continue to send more money to poor districts. ''The test will be next year,'' she said, referring to the 2008 budget. ''Will the formula really drive the aid?''</p>
        <p>Westchester Democrats said they would try to amend the budget bill to get more high-tax aid to their districts. ''Nassau, Suffolk and Orange were not cut out of the STAR program,'' Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky said. ''Why was Westchester cut out of the high-tax aid program?''</p>
        <p>Lisa P. Davis, president of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association, said, ''We do have a lot of diversity of wealth within the county, and that's not coming through when you look at the numbers.''</p>
        <p>All of the new state money will help blunt the effect of property tax increases this year, which districts say may average 6 percent or more. In Carle Place, for instance, the district's budget calls for a tax increase of 3.99 percent. The average additional STAR rebate for someone with an income of under $120,000 is $532, which would easily cover the additional tax for most homeowners, estimated at $235.</p>

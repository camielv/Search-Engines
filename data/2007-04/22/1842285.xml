        <p>Next weekend will lack the sizzle of the 2006 draft, which featured two Heisman Trophy winners (Reggie Bush and Matt Leinart) and leading players from two national championship teams (Bush, Leinart and Vince Young). But teams that need a wideout are in luck. This is a deep group of receivers and contains the best player in the draft, Georgia Tech's Calvin Johnson. He is so good that the Raiders will consider taking him with the first overall pick. But they, like a lot of teams near the top of the draft, need a quarterback. That could be a problem because there are not many top quarterbacks in the draft beyond Louisiana State's JaMarcus Russell and Notre Dame's Brady Quinn. Quinn's stock has fluctuated in the past year and his fate, like Leinart's last year, will be one of the intriguing stories Saturday. The top priority for every team, though, is clear: to avoid players with significant character issues. The new personal conduct policy allows the commissioner to discipline teams that consistently have players in trouble. Below, a look at each team's needs.</p>
        <p>By JUDY BATTISTA</p>
        <p>1. OAKLAND -- Needs plenty on offense, but quarterback remains a top priority on a team that has Randy Moss and Jerry Porter. The Raiders have never traded down in the first round.</p>
        <p>2. DETROIT -- Could consider a quarterback, but really needs help on defense, especially defensive end and cornerback. Will listen to plenty of trade offers to move down.</p>
        <p>3. CLEVELAND -- Lots of offensive needs, including quarterback and running back.</p>
        <p>4. TAMPA BAY -- Desperate for Calvin Johnson, it could try to move up if he is available.</p>
        <p>5. ARIZONA -- An offensive tackle who could start immediately.</p>
        <p>6. WASHINGTON -- A pass-rushing defensive end; the team had just 19 sacks in 2006.</p>
        <p>7. MINNESOTA -- Could use a quarterback, with Tarvaris Jackson penciled in at starter, but also needs playmakers on offense to help whoever the quarterback is.</p>
        <p>8. ATLANTA (from Houston) -- Offensive line, safety, receiver, defensive end.</p>
        <p>9. MIAMI -- The need for a quarterback is overwhelming, with Daunte Culpepper's health still in question. Also needs lots of bodies on offensive line.</p>
        <p>10. HOUSTON (from Atlanta) -- Needs a second receiver to pair with Andre Johnson and give new quarterback Matt Schaub more weapons. It could also use a starting-caliber cornerback.</p>
        <p>11. SAN FRANCISCO -- Improved defense with free agency spending spree, but still needs help just about everywhere, especially on the defensive line and the back end of the secondary.</p>
        <p>12. BUFFALO -- Willis McGahee is gone, so the Bills need a running back. Also needs linebackers.</p>
        <p>13. ST. LOUIS -- Improving the run defense is critical.</p>
        <p>14. CAROLINA -- Safety and tight end are its most urgent needs, but linebacker could use an infusion of help, too.</p>
        <p>15. PITTSBURGH -- Linebacker and cornerback for a defense that will still be a 3-4, but will likely become a 4-3 under the new coach, Mike Tomlin.</p>
        <p>16. GREEN BAY -- A running back and a wide receiver would give Brett Favre more weapons in the West Coast offense.</p>
        <p>17. JACKSONVILLE -- Safety is only hole in an otherwise stellar defense. A top-flight receiver would help Byron Leftwich.</p>
        <p>18. CINCINNATI -- Needs a big defensive tackle to shore up run defense. Also could use linebacker help. Biggest need: spotless character players.</p>
        <p>19. TENNESSEE -- Suspension of Pacman Jones makes cornerback a need, but first priority should be receiver.</p>
        <p>20. GIANTS -- Linebacker, cornerback and left offensive tackle.</p>
        <p>21. DENVER -- Receiver, pass-rushing end and depth at safety for a team that barely missed the playoffs.</p>
        <p>22. DALLAS -- Needs help across the board on defense, particularly at cornerback.</p>
        <p>23. KANSAS CITY -- Aging team needs youth everywhere, but especially at wide receiver, offensive line and cornerback.</p>
        <p>24. NEW ENGLAND (from Seattle) -- First of two first-round picks for team that was extremely active in free agency; will try to get younger at linebacker and get help in secondary.</p>
        <p>25. JETS -- Cornerback is an overwhelming need.</p>
        <p>26. PHILADELPHIA -- Linebacker and depth in secondary.</p>
        <p>27. NEW ORLEANS -- Cornerback and depth at linebacker and on the defensive line.</p>
        <p>28. NEW ENGLAND -- See No. 24.</p>
        <p>29. BALTIMORE -- Needs cornerback to replace the aging Samari Rolle, in addition to a linebacker and offensive tackle.</p>
        <p>30. SAN DIEGO -- Most talented team in N.F.L. doesn't need much beyond a No. 1 receiver.</p>
        <p>31. CHICAGO -- Uncertainty over the futures of linebacker Lance Briggs (seeking trade) and defensive tackle Tank Johnson (could face suspension) make their positions a need. But the team's weakness is offense.</p>
        <p>32. INDIANAPOLIS -- Defense was picked over in free agency; needs tackle, linebacker and cornerback.</p>

        <p>Re ''The Pilotless Plane that Only Looks Like Child's Play'' (April 15), about unmanned aerial vehicles used by the military:</p>
        <p>The Air Force is not desiring to ''control the deployment of unmanned airplanes,'' as the article said, but is recommending that it be designated the Department of Defense executive agent to oversee the purchasing process for medium- and high-altitude U.A.V.'s. The associated authority would let the Air Force standardize and streamline U.A.V. purchasing to produce substantial cost savings benefiting all the military services.</p>

        <p>Re ''The Pilotless Plane that Only Looks Like Child's Play'' (April 15), about unmanned aerial vehicles used by the military:</p>
        <p>The Air Force is not desiring to ''control the deployment of unmanned airplanes,'' as the article said, but is recommending that it be designated the Department of Defense executive agent to oversee the purchasing process for medium- and high-altitude U.A.V.'s. The associated authority would let the Air Force standardize and streamline U.A.V. purchasing to produce substantial cost savings benefiting all the military services.</p>
        <p>As executive agent, the Air Force would merge duplicative programs, increasing economies of scale, and enhance how U.A.V.'s work together for all the services. Separate from the issue of executive agency, the Air Force advocates that medium- and high-altitude U.A.V.'s be controlled jointly. The result would be that intelligence from U.A.V.'s would be distributed to the greatest number of troops on the ground, sea and in the air.</p>

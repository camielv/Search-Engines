      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>THE Connecticut State Legislature recently rejected a bill that would in effect force oil companies to charge the same price for their gasoline everywhere in the state, from Greenwich to Putnam. The proponents of the bill, however, have vowed to fight on and make Connecticut the first state to do this. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of confusion about what a uniform statewide gas price would mean.</p>
        <p>First, some explanation. Oil companies do not set a uniform wholesale price for gasoline across the state. Instead, they decide the price to charge by grouping gas stations into areas, or zones, that have similar markets -- a practice called zone pricing. (The oil companies do not get together to determine the number of zones, location of zones or prices in the zones -- that would be price collusion and it's illegal.) If Connecticut bans zone pricing, each oil company would still decide what price to charge in the state, but local market conditions would become largely irrelevant.</p>

        <p>THE Connecticut State Legislature recently rejected a bill that would in effect force oil companies to charge the same price for their gasoline everywhere in the state, from Greenwich to Putnam. The proponents of the bill, however, have vowed to fight on and make Connecticut the first state to do this. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of confusion about what a uniform statewide gas price would mean.</p>
        <p>First, some explanation. Oil companies do not set a uniform wholesale price for gasoline across the state. Instead, they decide the price to charge by grouping gas stations into areas, or zones, that have similar markets -- a practice called zone pricing. (The oil companies do not get together to determine the number of zones, location of zones or prices in the zones -- that would be price collusion and it's illegal.) If Connecticut bans zone pricing, each oil company would still decide what price to charge in the state, but local market conditions would become largely irrelevant.</p>
        <p>What does this mean for consumers? It means that wholesale prices would be the same in, say, north-central Connecticut, Litchfield County and Fairfield County, even though they are all very different markets.</p>
        <p>North-central Connecticut is average for the state in both the income of consumers and the number of gas stations per resident. That is, neither incomes nor gas stations per resident are unusually high or low relative to the rest of state. The typical gas station in this area probably pays a wholesale price for its gasoline that is about average for the state and charges a price at the pump that is also about average. We can think of this station as representing the ''average'' station in Connecticut in the sense that it faces neither extremely high or low demand nor number of competitors.</p>
        <p>Next consider a station in a part of Connecticut like Litchfield County, where either the number of competitors is high so local competition is fierce or demand for gas is relatively low or both. This station charges a lower price than the average station does. In return it will negotiate lower wholesale prices for its gas and other supplies, lower wages for its employees and lower rent for its land. Gas distributors to this station have an interest in seeing it survive. Thus, local market conditions force oil companies to sell gas to this station at a wholesale price lower than what it would typically charge.</p>
        <p>Now consider the fate of the station in a place like Fairfield County where incomes and demand are high or competition is scarce or both. This station can charge prices at the pump that are above the average. While the station would still like to negotiate low wholesale gas prices, low wages, low costs for other supplies and low rent in order to earn above average profits, no one is willing to play along.</p>
        <p>These three stations illustrate zone pricing at work. To see that this is good for consumers, consider what would happen if a single wholesale price for gas was instituted.</p>
        <p>If the state were to force oil companies to charge the lowest wholesale price, distributors would be tempted to restrict supply to Connecticut and focus on more profitable markets. That withdrawal of supply would drive up gasoline prices in the state.</p>
        <p>What about the highest wholesale price? Well, let's hope that's not what they do. It would clearly raise all pump prices a lot everywhere but is fortunately unlikely to occur. That leaves us with a wholesale price somewhere in the middle. To be precise, let's suppose it's the average wholesale price you'd find in north-central Connecticut.</p>
        <p>The stations in areas where there is low income but lots of competition like our Litchfield example would see higher wholesale prices under the ban. Those stations, already operating on thin margins, will be forced to raise prices at the pump or go out of business.</p>
        <p>And what about stations in Fairfield? These stations will find that wholesale prices have fallen, which means their costs are lower. These stations would be stupid to pass on the costs to consumers in the form of lower prices at the pump. Why? Because the pressure to pass on lower costs is minimal. So, prices at the pump for consumers in this area won't fall.</p>
        <p>How do we know this? Using actual Connecticut data for a recent three-year period, we found that prices at the pump would have risen in about 80 percent of the state. They would have remained unchanged in only Fairfield County, where incomes are highest and the number of stations per resident is lowest.</p>
        <p>State legislators should think again about the effects of banning zone pricing. It will harm most, if not all, Connecticut consumers, especially those with the lowest incomes.</p>

        <p>To a first-timer, the letters that arrive in spring from financial aid offices can be a head-scratcher: no two packages are alike. Private institutions, especially, interpret family finances in different ways; some have deeper pockets; some fail to meet ''demonstrated need'' (the difference between the cost of attending and the amount a family is deemed able to pay, according to a need analysis formula). According to an annual College Board survey, the private colleges below provide aid packages that meet the highest percentage of need. In reviewing offers, remember: loans have to be paid back, grants do not.</p>
        <p>KEY:</p>
        <p>COST: Tuition, fees, room and board  AVERAGE AID PACKAGE: Given freshmen with need  SELF-HELP: Work-study and need-based loans  NON-NEED: Grants and scholarships, excluding athletic awards  PERCENTAGES: % of applicants getting this aid (non-need: % of class)  ALL DOLLAR FIGURES IN THOUSANDS (for freshman class, 2005)</p>

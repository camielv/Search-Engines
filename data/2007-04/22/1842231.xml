        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for your continued support of New Orleans (''Broken Promises to a Broken Gulf,'' editorial, April 17).</p>
        <p>The $110 billion that was initially committed after Katrina was divided up over the five states that were hit, and much of it went to cleanup work that was contracted out by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Amazingly, there were so many layers of management involved that a great deal of money was wasted.</p>
        <p>For example, the people hauling trash from the city streets were paid about $12 an hour, lived in cars and tents, and didn't have access to plumbing or electricity. However, they worked for a subcontractor, who worked for a subcontractor, who worked for a subcontractor. The ''blue roofs'' that FEMA put on homes usually cost much more than if they had been installed by locals, who couldn't bid for the jobs.</p>
        <p>In other words, the country was robbed, but not by citizens of this area.</p>
        <p>I don't blame the people of this country for losing interest in us. But I do blame people here and across the country, and our Congress, for their lack of vision in choosing and following this administration blindly as it drags our country further into a black hole.</p>
        <p>Melody Lee  Kenner, La., April 18, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I worked alongside residents of the hard-hit Ninth Ward neighborhood in New Orleans as part of a recent teenage group trip to help in the rebuilding effort.</p>
        <p>I was struck that although after 19 months most of their neighborhood was still boarded up and empty, residents did not react with anger when asked if they were getting any government help now. They seemed completely resigned to the fact that help would not be coming and that they would have to do it all themselves.</p>
        <p>Their spirits seemed broken. It broke my heart.</p>

        <p>As a licensed funeral director and founder and chairman of Service Corporation International, the mortuary operator, R. L. Waltrip knows something about untimely passings. And this year, Mr. Waltrip faces the sad prospect of watching 2.8 million stock options he holds expire worthless.</p>
        <p>The company, based in Houston, is still on the mend from an expansion binge that mostly ended in 1999. Its stock has not risen above $12.33 in the past year. Thus, 400,000 options with an exercise price of $14.81 would have expired worthless on March 10, according to Service Corporation's recently filed proxy statement. And 800,000, exercisable at $19.47 a share, expire May 12.</p>

        <p>As a licensed funeral director and founder and chairman of Service Corporation International, the mortuary operator, R. L. Waltrip knows something about untimely passings. And this year, Mr. Waltrip faces the sad prospect of watching 2.8 million stock options he holds expire worthless.</p>
        <p>The company, based in Houston, is still on the mend from an expansion binge that mostly ended in 1999. Its stock has not risen above $12.33 in the past year. Thus, 400,000 options with an exercise price of $14.81 would have expired worthless on March 10, according to Service Corporation's recently filed proxy statement. And 800,000, exercisable at $19.47 a share, expire May 12.</p>
        <p>There is still some hope, though, for a group of 1,613,003 options, exercisable at $12.88 each, expiring Nov. 9.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waltrip declined to comment, according to a spokesman, Greg Bolton. But there is no need to feel too sorry for him. He has 3.6 million other options expiring through 2010 with current unrealized gains of about $27 million.</p>
        <p>And, though he is no longer chief executive, he remains well paid. His 2006 salary and incentive compensation totaled $6 million, including $176,751 to provide him with a car, driver and security around his home.</p>

        <p>In Katonah, a community group and a local business owner have formally filed their opposition to an attempt by Martha Stewart's company to trademark the wealthy hamlet's name for a line of furnishings and other home décor merchandise.</p>
        <p>The Katonah Village Improvement Society and Andrew Hall Baren, the owner of Katonah Architectural Hardware and Katonah Paint and Hardware, filed their objection with the Patent and Trademark Office on April 11.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baren's brother, Ian Baren, 43, said the family had already spent tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees fighting the trademark application. ''We simply want to protect our name recognition without confusion with other products,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lydia Landesberg, the society's president, said that while she personally felt neighborly toward Ms. Stewart -- who bought a 153-acre estate in the village, which is part of Bedford, in 2000 -- she also felt it was wrong for Ms. Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, to trademark the town's name for commercial use.</p>
        <p>''Instead of being identified with our little town,'' Ms. Landesberg said, the name Katonah ''is going to be identified with housewares.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Landesberg also noted that the Martha Stewart line of Katonah furniture, already available at Macy's, did not accurately reflect the town's design history.</p>
        <p>''We have a historical Victorian district, and she's selling Chippendale and Queen Anne furniture,'' Ms. Landesberg said.</p>
        <p>Asked if she feared that the trademark would lead to an influx of tourists in secluded Katonah, Ms. Landesberg said many visitors from the New York area already came to the town to visit its museum. But, she said, ''there's a certain kind of tourist who comes for culture and another who comes to gawk and look for celebrities.''</p>
        <p>John Cuti, general counsel for Ms. Stewart's company, said it was seeking the trademark only to prevent knockoffs of Ms. Stewart's Katonah products, not to stop local merchants from using the town's name for their own business needs. In cases where those needs might violate the trademark, the company would gladly work out ''coexistence agreements,'' Mr. Cuti said.</p>
        <p>The town's chamber of commerce takes no issue with the trademark plans, said its president, Ron Romanowicz.</p>
        <p>''Our only goal is to protect local merchants so they can use the name as well,'' he said. ''We're not look at whether this is bad for our town's identity.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, he said, he wished the company were not pursuing the trademark in the first place. ''Who needs to own the name Katonah for anything?'' he asked.</p>

        <p>Correction of Apr 15 article about New York Philharmonic (S)</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article last Sunday about potential candidates for music director of the New York Philharmonic misspelled the surname of a guest conductor who has impressed the orchestra's musicians. He is Ludovic Morlot, not Merlot. The article also misidentified the work that Gustavo Dudamel, who will take over as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 2009, conducted in his debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was Mahler's First Symphony, not his Fifth Symphony. The article also gave an incorrect surname in some references for a conductor who will lead the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. He is Jaap van Zweden, not von Zweden.</p>

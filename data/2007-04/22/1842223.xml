        <p>As a single event, the shootings last week at Virginia Tech were horrific in scale. But every day in the United States, dozens of people die from gunfire.</p>
        <p>In 2004, the most recent year for which figures are available, an average of about 81 people died everyday from gunfire in the United States. The chart below gives a rough accounting of who was killed, and how.</p>
        <p>All told, 29,569 people were killed that year by firearms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another 64,389 were injured, about 176 per day.</p>
        <p>On the chart, each bullet represents one of the those 81 deaths. They are grouped by the age of the victims, and color-coded to indicate the cause of each fatality:</p>
        <p>The daily figures are approximations, rounded to the nearest whole number from this calculation: Total 2004 deaths in each group, divided by the 366 days that year.</p>
        <p>Because some minority groups have relatively fewer gun deaths, they don't appear in a daily tally. But 281 American Indians were killed by guns in 2004, the same proportion of that population as whites; 398 Asians were killed, a rate one-third of whites.</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 29, 2007, Sunday  A chart last Sunday on daily gun deaths in the United States included an extraneous symbol in some editions. The symbol, a bullet, represented a single death of a person over 40. There should have been 39 bullets depicted, as the text indicated, not 40.</p>

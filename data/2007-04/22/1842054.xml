        <p>NORMALLY, Denis Leary is the one impressing audiences with his scabrous stand-up comedy act or as the tough-guy firefighter Tommy Gavin on the TV series, ''Rescue Me.''</p>
        <p>But last Saturday, Mr. Leary stood onstage at the town hall in Washington ''stunned and awed,'' he said, by the talent of 23 students whose poems and essays were chosen to be recited by 10 area celebrities in the second annual ''Celebration of Young Writers.''</p>
        <p>''I'm completely blown away to be surrounded by all of these gifted kids,'' said Mr. Leary, who was the M.C. for the event, a fund-raiser for the After School Arts Program, which has students from 32 towns enrolled in more than 100 workshops, from dance to drama, painting to poetry, across the state.</p>
        <p>The students, ages 5 to 17, sat on the stage as their works were read, some so small that their feet swung from the chairs.</p>
        <p>First was Jack Burns, 5, a pupil at Rumsey Hall School in Washington, in a blue blazer and tie, whose poem was titled, ''Untitled.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leary, who also wore a blue blazer rather than his signature leather jacket, recited:</p>
        <p>I was on a blue plane to Denver.</p>
        <p>I saw a bucking bull at the fair.</p>
        <p>The bull was bucking a cowboy</p>
        <p>and I was eating a hot dog.</p>
        <p>There was Daniel O'Connell-Santos, 15, from Shepaug Valley High School in Washington, whose poem, ''Love Is a Thing That Purrs,'' was recited by Fran Brill Kelly, a ''Sesame Street'' puppeteer from Bethlehem.</p>
        <p>Daniel, scuffing his foot across the floor, said he was ''thoroughly embarrassed.''</p>
        <p>His poem, about someone who has played hard to get, ends:</p>
        <p>But once you give up trying</p>
        <p>And just want to be left alone</p>
        <p>That darn thing calls you five times</p>
        <p>And purrs with the sweetest tone.</p>
        <p>Another Shepaug student, Alex Maddalena, 17, dedicated his poem, ''Forgive Me Father, for I Have Sinned,'' about President Bush and the Iraq war, to his teacher, Wendy Youngblood, who sat in the audience, wiping away mascara-gray tear streaks.</p>
        <p>The writer Frank McCourt, of Roxbury, recited a poem, ''Count Greffi,'' by Alexander Adam, 16, a Gunnery School student. It began:</p>
        <p>Here, where money is searching for bright ideas,</p>
        <p>and the bright ideas are searching for money.</p>
        <p>Where your sense of direction gets you lost,</p>
        <p>and ladies of 5th, Lexington and Park look pretty,</p>
        <p>Whatever the cost</p>
        <p>The poem ended to applause, and Mr. McCourt remarked, ''I think Walt Whitman is up there applauding, too.''</p>
        <p>The event, which included a silent auction of items donated by area residents, raised $37,000.</p>

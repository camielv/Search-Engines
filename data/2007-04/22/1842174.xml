        <p>AS teenagers clustered near bodegas, and old men hobbled past with their canes, Virginia Martinez was busy in the back of her tiny shipping store on Westchester Avenue in Hunts Point one afternoon late last month, preparing her three children for their trip to Mexico.</p>
        <p>Lucía, a thickset woman of 18 with shiny braces on her teeth, helped her mother shut densely packed suitcases that weighed in at the airline limit of 70 pounds each.</p>
        <p>Alejandro, 14, ran to the barbershop across the street for a haircut, gushing about how excited he would be to play soccer with his Mexican cousins.</p>
        <p>Raul said nothing. A shy 5-year-old with wide eyes and dark hair that fit his head like a snug cap, he clung to his mother's leg and eyed the preparations with curiosity.</p>
        <p>The three young people, dreaming of Mexican dances and homemade tamarind candies, were traveling to Acatlán de Osorio, their mother's hometown in the state of Puebla, 110 miles southeast of Mexico City. The week between Palm Sunday and Easter brings the town's annual fair, a traditional celebration that many Mexican communities hold at various times of the year.</p>
        <p>More and more Mexicans may be arriving in New York, but like the Martinez family, they remain linked to the country of their birth by annual pilgrimages to their hometown fairs. One common destination is Puebla, which is the native state of about half of New York City's 450,000 Mexicans, according to Robert Courtney Smith, an associate professor at Baruch College. Even if the immigrants have come to New York illegally and cannot risk leaving the United States, they reaffirm their Mexican identity by sending money to finance these hometown festivities.</p>
        <p>''People will save up money all year long to be able to go to this,'' Professor Smith said. ''This could be the central social event of their entire year.</p>
        <p>''For second-generation kids, it changes the way they experience assimilation and settlement,'' he continued, ''because they have this entire other way of understanding what being Mexican means down there.''</p>
        <p>Such is the case for the Martinez children. They were all born in the United States and say they do not want to live in Mexico, but they also say they feel more Mexican than American.</p>
        <p>Lucía, a senior at Crotona Academy High School who aspires to become a United States customs agent, said that she couldn't wait to eat tortas de camaron -- shrimp fritters -- and to stay in her grandmother's house three blocks from Acatlán's town center. Alejandro lit up recalling the fun he'd had at last year's fair. ''They got carnival rides, the wheel of fortune, little games,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At 6 p.m., a van arrived to ferry them to the airport. Their plane would leave at midnight.</p>

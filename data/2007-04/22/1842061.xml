        <p>GETTING into Harvard isn't easy, but statistically, it's more likely if you attend public or private high school in New York City. In the last five years, students from the five boroughs have been admitted at a rate five to eight percentage points higher than that of the overall applicant pool.</p>
        <p>''It runs totally counter to urban legend,'' says William R. Fitzsimmons, Harvard's dean of undergraduate admissions and financial aid, referring to the belief that Harvard is so eager for geographic diversity that students from regions with fewer applicants have a better shot. His philosophy: ''If the 19th person from Stuyvesant is better than the only kid from North Dakota, take the kid from Stuyvesant.'' (For those living in North Dakota, Stuyvesant High School is a public math-and-science powerhouse in lower Manhattan.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzsimmons, chairman of the subcommittee that reviews New York City's applicants, fields 800 to 900 applications a year.</p>
        <p>Speaking one snowy afternoon as he read folders from this year's hopefuls, he explained the admissions discrepancy: ''There are just so many great kids from New York.''</p>

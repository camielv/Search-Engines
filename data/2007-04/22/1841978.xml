        <p>In our ever-recyclable culture things don't get old; they become ''vintage.'' This week is a particularly interesting one for vintage theater. ''Biography,'' a comedy by a largely forgotten American playwright, S. N. Behrman, is resurrected by the Pearl Theater. And a whole company, the legendary Living Theater, springs back onto the scene with a new home and a new version of one of its most controversial works.</p>
        <p>The big event is the return of the LIVING THEATER, the celebrated avant-garde company founded by Judith Malina and Julian Beck. This unabashedly radical troupe hit its stride in the early 1960s, winning its third Obie award in 1963 for ''The Brig,'' the autobiographical play by Kenneth H. Brown about the brutality of a Marine Corps prison. Itinerant for many years, the company now has a permanent space to play in, and Ms. Malina, still very much in charge (Mr. Beck died in 1985), will direct the new production. ''The Brig'' opens Thursday at the Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, livingtheatre.org; $20 to $30.</p>
        <p>The experimental theatrics of the Living Theater seem remote from today's scene, but the high comedy exemplified by the work of Mr. Behrman is probably a further stretch. ''BIOGRAPHY,'' produced on Broadway in 1932, is the story of a painter setting out to write her memoirs. Trouble arises when a key player in her past, now a prominent political figure, registers an objection. The third major character is the radical publisher, intent on getting his author to tell all. J. R. Sullivan directs. ''Biography'' opens Sunday at the Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802, pearltheatre.org; $40 to $70.</p>

        <p>OPENING a club in a New York institution like the Chelsea Hotel, a veritable vertical village whose arty flophouse allure Arthur Miller described as the ''high spot of the surreal,'' is a double-edged pursuit.

        <p>OPENING a club in a New York institution like the Chelsea Hotel, a veritable vertical village whose arty flophouse allure Arthur Miller described as the ''high spot of the surreal,'' is a double-edged pursuit. While the address is easy to remember, its reputation may set up certain expectations.</p>
        <p>But on a recent Saturday night, the patrons at Star Lounge, the new nightclub cocooned in the hotel's basement, weren't feeling nostalgic, neither for the boho ghosts of William Burroughs, Edie Sedgwick and Dylan Thomas, nor for Serena, the eccentric boîte the Star Lounge replaced.</p>
        <p>''I've never been here before,'' said Lisel Ashlock, 30, a graphic designer from California. ''It feels like we are in a fancy submarine, like a club I went to in B.V.I.'' B.V.I.? ''The British Virgin Islands,'' she explained as strobe lights flashed and bounced off the low ceilings of the main lounge.</p>
        <p>There are allusions to the old hotel -- the V.I.P. section is named Room 100, after the room where Sid was supposed to have stabbed Nancy, and cheeky cocktails like the Hooker and the Actor refer to infamous residents. But Serena had been swept away.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to put my own stamp here,'' said Charles Ferri, an owner, who opened Star Room in the Hamptons last year, and plans to bring it back this summer. ''I didn't want people to say, 'It's Serena, but juiced up.' I wanted it to be a more discreet type of lounge where people can feel like they can open themselves up.''</p>
        <p>On this night, all three chambers were crammed with bottle-buying revelers who took turns pouring mixed drinks and dancing atop the banquettes. When D.J. Kiss, a former model, spun ''Bizarre Love Triangle'' by New Order, three women squealed and lost themselves in a diaphragm-expanding, high-school-exalting singalong.</p>
        <p>Before its official opening, Star Lounge played host to private events (like a record-release party for Patti Smith, a former tenant) that were in keeping with the hotel's celebrity draw. Starting next week, current resident and girl about town Lola Schnabel (daughter of the painter Julian) will take over D.J. duty on Monday nights. And at Tuesday's karaoke party, Josh Hartnett and Heather Graham, Mr. Ferri's girlfriend, become rock stars.</p>
        <p>''I prefer that night to the weekends here,'' said Rachel Wolff, 30, a trend forecaster. ''It's a more fashion crowd and people come to get discovered.''</p>
        <p>Star Lounge  222 West 23rd Street  New York (212) 255-4646</p>
        <p>GETTING IN -- Say you have a reservation for a table with bottle service, especially on weekends.</p>
        <p>DRESS CODE -- Collared shirts (untucked) for men; skinny jeans and midriff-baring shirts for women.</p>
        <p>SIGHTINGS -- Josh Hartnett, Heather Graham, Sienna Miller.</p>
        <p>SIGNATURE DRINK -- The Startini (Level vodka, Cointreau, peach liquor, cranberry and lemon juice, star fruit garnish), $16.</p>

        <p>Candyce Renée Major, 24, a registered nurse from Sydney, Australia (pictured with her boyfriend, James Clinch, 23): ''We were traveling in Cologne for the Christmas markets -- we were excited to see these markets and the Cologne Cathedral. However, we were also sad that we were away from home and away from our families for these Christmas festivities. The whole weekend we were thinking of our parents. It was Christmastime: The shopping was something for us, something for them, something for us, something for them. In this photo, the people walking past are a blur, so the focus is on us. That's the way we think of our holidays: We take it easy and at our pace, but so many people still live everyday lives and still have to do everyday things. So we can pause and stop time for as long as we like, yet people still move on.''</p>

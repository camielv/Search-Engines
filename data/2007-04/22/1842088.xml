        <p>At Amy's Omelette House in Long Branch, the humble egg is a showoff. The menu lists more than 200 kinds of supersize omelets, 10 variations on eggs Benedict, and eggs prepared every which way.</p>
        <p>Basic omelets here are made with three eggs. The port wine cheese and turkey omelet ($6.95) is an interesting alternative to the classic ham and Swiss combination ($6.75). The mushroom and scallion omelet ($6.75) is one of many vegetarian options.</p>

        <p>At Amy's Omelette House in Long Branch, the humble egg is a showoff. The menu lists more than 200 kinds of supersize omelets, 10 variations on eggs Benedict, and eggs prepared every which way.</p>
        <p>Basic omelets here are made with three eggs. The port wine cheese and turkey omelet ($6.95) is an interesting alternative to the classic ham and Swiss combination ($6.75). The mushroom and scallion omelet ($6.75) is one of many vegetarian options.</p>
        <p>Amy's more unusual omelets have playful names and inventive ingredients. The Lumber Jack mixes salmon, Canadian bacon and Monterey Jack cheese ($8.50). The hefty Manhandler is a meat-lover's choice with ham, turkey, bacon, sausage and cheese ($7.75). There are seafood omelets, too. The Sea Garden has crab meat, Monterey Jack cheese, tomato and hollandaise sauce ($8.75).</p>
        <p>Amy's country omelets use four eggs and are stuffed with home fries in addition to their fillings (the basic omelets have potatoes on the side). They are enormous and good to share.</p>
        <p>The choices don't end with eggs, though: Amy's also serves fluffy pancakes and thick-sliced French toast. Granny's pancakes with apples, walnuts, raisins and honey are tempting ($7.95), and the cinnamon almond French toast ($7.75) is tasty too. Belgian waffles and crepes are other sweet choices.</p>
        <p>Breakfast is served all day at this family-run restaurant, whose tables and booths can accommodate a crowd of about 220 people. The menu also features sandwiches and burgers, and even some dinners, like meatloaf ($13.95). But breakfast is by far Amy's biggest draw and has been since the Kopsaftis family, which used to own Mariner's Cove in Brielle, opened the restaurant in 2003. A second Amy's location in Burlington, which opened in 2005, has a similar menu but is not open for dinner.</p>
        <p>Amy's Omelette House, 444 Ocean Boulevard (Route 36), Long Branch; (732) 222-1206. Open Monday to Saturday, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sunday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.; www.youramys.com.  Also in Burlington at Route 130 South and High Street; (609) 386-4800; open daily 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>

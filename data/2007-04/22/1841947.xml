        <p>''They say Picasso is buried in his,'' Enrique Seseña says with a touch of pride. Mr. Seseña should know: his family has been making the object in question, the traditional Spanish cape, since 1901. When his grandfather opened his shop of the same name at the turn of the last century, there were dozens of tailors on Madrid's Calle de la Cruz, not far from the Puerta del Sol. Today, the street pulses with tapas bars and nightclubs, and Seseña is the only place on the block that recalls that earlier age, dedicating itself solely to the capa española.</p>
        <p>It is unlike any other cape. The classic model consists of two layers -- a 16-foot circle whose front folds are lined with red velvet, and a smaller circle that falls about the shoulders -- made of a singular kind of wool flannel, so dense it needs no hemming. The fabric comes from the town of Béjar, near Salamanca northwest of Madrid and known for its expertise in weaving cape wool. ''A cape that isn't made from that kind of fabric is not a good cape,'' Mr. Seseña says.</p>

        <p>''They say Picasso is buried in his,'' Enrique Seseña says with a touch of pride. Mr. Seseña should know: his family has been making the object in question, the traditional Spanish cape, since 1901. When his grandfather opened his shop of the same name at the turn of the last century, there were dozens of tailors on Madrid's Calle de la Cruz, not far from the Puerta del Sol. Today, the street pulses with tapas bars and nightclubs, and Seseña is the only place on the block that recalls that earlier age, dedicating itself solely to the capa española.</p>
        <p>It is unlike any other cape. The classic model consists of two layers -- a 16-foot circle whose front folds are lined with red velvet, and a smaller circle that falls about the shoulders -- made of a singular kind of wool flannel, so dense it needs no hemming. The fabric comes from the town of Béjar, near Salamanca northwest of Madrid and known for its expertise in weaving cape wool. ''A cape that isn't made from that kind of fabric is not a good cape,'' Mr. Seseña says.</p>
        <p>Inside the shop, the capes are cut and sewn by hand. In front, the finished products -- some with embroidery around the edges, all with decorative silver clasps -- drape from specially made wooden hangers. Prices range from 545 to 980 euros ($741 to $1,333 at $1.36 to the euro). There is also a line of more modern capes in bright colors for women (195 to 680 euros), though the traditionally male capa española went unisex long ago.</p>
        <p>First-time buyers are given a lesson in how to wear the cape. Draping it loosely around himself (''Never fasten the clasp! There's so much fabric, you'll choke yourself''), Mr. Seseña throws a fold over his shoulder with a flourish, so that the crimson velvet flashes. ''There,'' he says, glancing in the mirror with satisfaction. ''The cape shouldn't dominate you. You should dominate the cape.''</p>
        <p>Picasso knew how to dominate his Seseña cape; so did Gary Cooper. Federico Fellini bought four, only to be outdone by Yul Brynner, who bought six. Hillary Clinton and Nicolas Cage are more recent clients. ''The Spanish cape is a very suggestive piece of clothing,'' Mr. Seseña says. ''It can be traditional and bohemian all at once.''</p>

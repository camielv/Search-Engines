        <p>INTERNATIONAL 3-18</p>
        <p>Making Detainees Talk in Iraq  In the joint American and Iraqi operation to clear insurgents from dangerous neighborhoods, American troops are confronted with a problem: how to deal with their Iraqi counterparts' aggressive interrogation techniques, including beatings.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>A military investigation has found that the Marine Corps chain of command in Iraq showed a routine and blatant disregard for the lives of Iraqi civilians that contributed to its ''willful'' failure to investigate an attack by marines that killed 24 unarmed Iraqis.  18</p>
        <p>Kremlin Tightens Grip on Radio  Radio news in Russia has been a rare bright spot in a darkening media landscape. But new rules imposed on Russia's largest independent radio news network leave an increasingly small number of news outlets not managed by the government.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>New Defiance in Israeli Settlers  Jewish settlers evacuated from Gaza by the Israeli government 20 months ago are showing greater assertiveness in protesting the moves. They are taking advantage of the weakened position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who, after the rise to power of Hamas and Israel's war with Hezbollah in Lebanon last summer, is in no position to challenge the settlers.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>About a dozen masked Palestinians bombed and set fire to the American International School in Beit Lahiya, north of Gaza City, school officials and Palestinian security officials said, causing extensive damage, but no injuries.</p>
        <p>10</p>
        <p>Nigeria Vote Begins in Chaos  Nigeria's presidential election began amid chaos, with a botched attempt to smash a truck bomb into the headquarters of the electoral commission in the nation's capital and with ballots arriving late to polling places and lacking vital information to identify candidates and prevent fraud.</p>
        <p>3</p>
        <p>NATIONAL 20-27</p>
        <p>Infant Death Rate Up in South  For decades, Mississippi and neighboring states with large black populations and expanses of enduring poverty made steady progress in reducing infant death. But progress has stalled, and in recent years the death rate has risen in Mississippi and several other states.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Gunman's Silence and Rage  From the beginning, Seung-Hui Cho did not talk, and his mother agonized over his brooding behavior. Interviews with investigators, relatives, classmates and teachers show how Mr. Cho progressed from silence to murderous rage, and how he meticulously prepared for his final hours.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Giuliani's Immigration Stance  A decade ago, as mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani often defended illegal immigrants. But now he is running for president, and the politics of immigration in the post-9/11 world is vastly different.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION 29-34</p>
        <p>More Men Living Downtown  Men now outnumber women in Lower Manhattan by a ratio of 126 to 100, a disparity usually seen only in towns with prisons or military bases.  29</p>

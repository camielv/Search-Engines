        <p>When Angelina Jolie wore Rag &amp; Bone's mushroom-hued Mac Herring raincoat in a fashion spread for Vogue earlier this year, she loved it so much, she got one for herself. The coat's ensuing popularity was such that the company was moved to recut another batch in the more summery, lighter-colored fabric for warmer months. Now, shoppers can buy from a final shipment of the lighter Mac Herring. For the truly good planners, Rag &amp; Bone has responded to high customer demand by reissuing the Mac in navy, olive and plaid for fall ($510 in natural, $550 in navy, olive or plaid for pre-order), all at Barneys New York in Manhattan, (212) 826-8900.</p>

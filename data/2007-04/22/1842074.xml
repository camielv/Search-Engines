        <p>AFTER three years without a permanent superintendent, the Roslyn School District has found its new leader. On April 12, the school board unanimously voted to offer the position to John A. Richman, who has been the superintendent of the nearby Plainedge School District for the last eight years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richman, 59 and a resident of Rockville Centre, will start his new job on July 1 at a salary of $250,000, a little less than the $257,000 that he now is paid.</p>

        <p>AFTER three years without a permanent superintendent, the Roslyn School District has found its new leader. On April 12, the school board unanimously voted to offer the position to John A. Richman, who has been the superintendent of the nearby Plainedge School District for the last eight years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richman, 59 and a resident of Rockville Centre, will start his new job on July 1 at a salary of $250,000, a little less than the $257,000 that he now is paid.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richman said that he had decided a year ago to leave the Plainedge district.</p>
        <p>''I was ready for a change, and I think the district was ready for a change as well,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Pat Zinke, president of the Plainedge School Board, echoing Dr. Richman's comment, said, ''It came to the point when we all agreed on the need for a new perspective.''</p>
        <p>The Plainedge board voted unanimously to hire the assistant superintendent, Christine P'Simer, to take over as the new superintendent.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richman's priority as superintendent in Roslyn, he said, is ''to move beyond the financial side of the school district, and to bring back Roslyn to the prominence that it used to have.''</p>
        <p>After the resignation in 2004 of Frank Tassone, who is serving a prison sentence for his role in the district's $11 million embezzlement scandal, the district began a search for a new superintendent in the fall of 2005.</p>
        <p>Since 2004, the district has had two interim superintendents, David Helme and Gerard W. Dempsey, both of whom came out of retirement to hold the position temporarily.</p>
        <p>Dani Kline, the Roslyn School Board president, expressed enthusiasm for Dr. Richman, who was selected from more than 35 applicants.</p>
        <p>''We felt that Dr. Richman had the unique combination of vision, experience and focus on student achievement that we really needed to bring back stability to our school district,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richman has a doctorate in educational administration from Columbia University's Teachers College.</p>
        <p>He recently became an adjunct assistant professor at Hofstra University in the Department of Educational Leadership.</p>

        <p>THE NOISETTES, an English band that comes to the Mercury Lounge on Monday night, represent the latest volley in a long trans-Atlantic interchange. The Noisettes are a trio with a volatile female lead singer, Shingai Shoniwa (who also plays bass); she can be frantic, flirtatious, playful and pensive, in songs that leap from punk to hard rock to math-rock to something like swing. So the Noisettes are a rejoinder to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs from New York City. But the Yeah Yeah Yeahs owe a lot to English bands like X-Ray Spex and Siouxsie and the Banshees, who in turn were inspired by Patti Smith, who</p>
        <p>Anyway, the Noisettes have their own flair. The songs on their new album, ''What's the Time Mr. Wolf?'' (Universal Motown), are sinewy and full of surprises, like irregular meters and sudden stylistic mutations. Ms. Shoniwa belts advice -- ''Scratch your name into the fabric of this world before you go'' -- and feisty declarations: ''We complement each other just like Satan and Christ.'' They're on a quadruple bill that also includes LOOKER, a New York City band drawing on girl groups and punk; one song exults in being ''hopped up on pheromones.'' 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side; (212) 260-4700; $12.</p>
        <p>Speaking of PATTI SMITH -- rocker, poet, three-chord shaman -- she's playing three New York City shows this week, all on one night: Tuesday. ''The Bowery Sesssions'' marks the release of her new album, ''Twelve,'' which is a collection of songs by others, including Jimi Hendrix, Tears for Fears and Nirvana. After more than three decades of writing and performing Ms. Smith has more than enough of her own material to fill three sets without repeating a song, should she choose. 6, 8:30 and 10:30, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $17; sold out.</p>

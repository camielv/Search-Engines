        <p>If you were asked to come up with an immutable law of job searching, one of them might be this: The lower the unemployment rate, the less time it takes to find a new job.</p>
        <p>But the world can work in unexpected ways, and so it does now. National unemployment dropped to 4.5 percent in the first quarter of this year, and yet it took job seekers a median 3.6 months to land a new position, according to a survey by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, the outplacement firm.</p>

        <p>If you were asked to come up with an immutable law of job searching, one of them might be this: The lower the unemployment rate, the less time it takes to find a new job.</p>
        <p>But the world can work in unexpected ways, and so it does now. National unemployment dropped to 4.5 percent in the first quarter of this year, and yet it took job seekers a median 3.6 months to land a new position, according to a survey by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, the outplacement firm.</p>
        <p>That compares with 2.7 months in the first quarter of last year, when the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent.</p>
        <p>The reason? Opportunities are so abundant in many fields that workers are not willing to settle for just any job. This is especially true for jobs that require four-year degrees, where unemployment is under 2 percent, according to Challenger.</p>
        <p>Have you always dreamed of a job with a four-day week working five-hour days with 12 weeks of vacation and free espresso drinks? Based on the numbers, this would be a good time to look for it.</p>

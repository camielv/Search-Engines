        <p>A 40-year-old Bronx man was arrested at Shea Stadium on Friday night during the Mets' game after being accused of trying to blind Atlanta Braves players with a high-power flashlight, the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Frank Martinez, who was sitting behind home plate, was accused of shining the flashlight at pitcher Tim Hudson and shortstop Édgar Rentería before Hudson pitched to the Mets' Endy Chávez in the eighth inning. The second-base umpire, Paul Emmel, who was also affected, alerted security officials, and the game was stopped while Martinez was taken to Shea's security office.</p>

        <p>A 40-year-old Bronx man was arrested at Shea Stadium on Friday night during the Mets' game after being accused of trying to blind Atlanta Braves players with a high-power flashlight, the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Frank Martinez, who was sitting behind home plate, was accused of shining the flashlight at pitcher Tim Hudson and shortstop Édgar Rentería before Hudson pitched to the Mets' Endy Chávez in the eighth inning. The second-base umpire, Paul Emmel, who was also affected, alerted security officials, and the game was stopped while Martinez was taken to Shea's security office.</p>
        <p>''In a game in which the ball can travel upwards of 110 miles per hour, the defendant's alleged actions were dangerous to both spectators and players,'' Brown said. ''This was definitely not the defendant's most shining moment.''</p>
        <p>Martinez was charged with interference with a professional sporting event and second-degree reckless endangerment. If convicted, he faces up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine.</p>

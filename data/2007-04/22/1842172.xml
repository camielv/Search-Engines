        <p>Article on Jose Adames, teacher's assistant at Washington Heights middle school who has been waging poster campaign in Upper Manhattan in his two-year quest to replace Michael Bloomberg as New York City mayor; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>LAST week, a fastidious 63-year-old with a salt-and-pepper mustache named Jose Adames was leaning against a lamppost on West 171st Street, posing for a photograph. A bystander, Carmen Cabrera, noticed the fuss and asked his name. ''Oh!'' Ms. Cabrera said when the man replied. ''I've always wondered, where is that gentleman I read so much about?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cabrera had probably not read much about Mr. Adames in the city's newspapers, which have barely reported his two-year quest to replace Michael Bloomberg as mayor. Nor does she read the minutes of Community Board 12, at whose meetings Mr. Adames usually speaks until shooed from the podium.</p>

        <p>LAST week, a fastidious 63-year-old with a salt-and-pepper mustache named Jose Adames was leaning against a lamppost on West 171st Street, posing for a photograph. A bystander, Carmen Cabrera, noticed the fuss and asked his name. ''Oh!'' Ms. Cabrera said when the man replied. ''I've always wondered, where is that gentleman I read so much about?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cabrera had probably not read much about Mr. Adames in the city's newspapers, which have barely reported his two-year quest to replace Michael Bloomberg as mayor. Nor does she read the minutes of Community Board 12, at whose meetings Mr. Adames usually speaks until shooed from the podium.</p>
        <p>But many people who have walked through Upper Manhattan know Mr. Adames's name from the thousands of his stickers and fliers that paper the area's newspaper boxes, phone booths, bus stops and lampposts.</p>
        <p>''!Bloomberg! Learn to Lose,'' they read. ''Adames is the Mayor!'' ''!Bloomberg! Stop conspiracy, resign now.''</p>
        <p>Most lay out a jumble of accusations against the mayor, whom Mr. Adames accuses of filing invalid voter petitions during his 2005 campaign. (Mr. Adames has pursued his case in court, unsuccessfully, since 2005.)</p>
        <p>''He's an equal opportunity flierer,'' Martin Collins, the community board's former chairman, said the other day, speaking from a phone booth that, he noted, had an Adames poster plastered above each phone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins confronted Mr. Adames at a board meeting in February. ''I stood up,'' he recalled, ''and I said to him, 'I have a question: Will you stop littering the community with your fliers?' People in the audience applauded. He said, 'No.' ''</p>
        <p>Kathy Dawkins, a spokeswoman for the Department of Sanitation, said Mr. Adames had never been fined because his posters do not provide his address or telephone number, which the department requires to issue a summons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adames, a teacher's assistant at a Washington Heights middle school, is a gentler character than his fliers might suggest. The other day, at a McDonald's, he described his methods. In warm weather, he goes out by himself up to three times a week, putting up about 300 fliers and stickers per excursion. He estimates that he has posted more than 20,000 in the past two years, at a cost of more than $8,000, almost all of which he paid himself.</p>
        <p>As an adhesive, he favors glue. ''Sometimes I use tape,'' he said. ''But that's rare, because people can rip it off.''</p>

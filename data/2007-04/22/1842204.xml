        <p>The stock market soared last week, propelling the Dow Jones industrial average to a record close on three successive days and ending the week at a new high.</p>
        <p>A series of corporate earnings reports that exceeded Wall Street's expectations appeared to be the principal reason for the market's buoyancy, but there was strong economic data as well.</p>
        <p>In a report on inflation on Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, was running at a 2.5 percent annual rate through March -- lower than had been anticipated on Wall Street, and 0.2 percentage point below the annual rate through February.</p>
        <p>Honeywell shares rose 9.3 percent for the week, the best showing among the Dow Jones industrials. The company reported a 21 percent gain in first-quarter earnings.</p>
        <p>For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 349.85 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 12,961.98. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index jumped 31.50 points, or 2.2 percent, to close at 1,484.35. The Nasdaq composite index rose 34.45 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 2,526.39. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.67 percent from 4.76 percent the previous week.</p>

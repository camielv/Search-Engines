        <p>The 'Phantom' Strikes Again  The dictionary defines ''phantom'' as something that seems to appear to the sight but has no physical existence. Tell that to the actors, musicians and stagehands at the Majestic Theater, where ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' the longest-running show in Broadway history, will hit the 8,000-performance milestone at its matinee tomorrow. The Andrew Lloyd Webber Tony Award-winning musical about a furtive masked figure smitten with a young soprano at the Paris Opera House will observe the occasion with a special presentation during the curtain call, and the cast and crew will celebrate with a private party. Since its debut on Broadway on Jan. 26, 1988, the show has been seen by 11 million people in New York and grossed nearly $645 million, according to a press representative. The worldwide box-office take was put at $3.2 billion.</p>
        <p>Nelly Furtado's Weekend  The pop singer Nelly Furtado was the big winner (and the host) when the Junos, Canada's equivalent of the Grammys, were awarded in Toronto on Sunday, Reuters reported. Ms. Furtado, 28, above, took the prizes for best single, best album and fans' choice, after winning for artist and pop album the night before. Bob Rock, the Canadian rocker-turned-producer, was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame for his work with bands including Metallica, Aerosmith and Mötley Crüe.</p>
        <p>Up and Coming in Germany  With 150 works by Cézanne, Monet, Gauguin and Rodin, among others, a major exhibition of 19th-century French art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art is to open in Berlin on June 1 at the Neue Nationalgalerie, the Berlin tourism board announced yesterday, The Associated Press reported. Organizers of the show, to run through Oct. 7, hope to achieve the success attained at the same museum in 2004, when 1.2 million visitors turned out for an exhibition drawn from the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. The 18th-century Staatsoper opera house, top, in Berlin is expected to undergo three years of major renovation beginning in 2010, The Associated Press reported. ''Everything must be taken out,'' said Peter Mussbach, the general manager. ''This is a gigantic task.'' Gutted at the end of World War II and reopened by East German authorities in 1955, the house was last renovated in 1986. In 2002 a hydraulic stage elevator collapsed during a performance of Mozart's ''Don Giovanni.'' Mr. Mussbach said that during renovations, expected to cost $174 million, operas would be staged at an alternative site, but he declined to specify where. In Hamburg, Germany, the foundation stone was laid yesterday for the new Elbe Philharmonic concert hall, bottom left, a $322 million structure designed by the Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron and scheduled for completion in 2010, The Associated Press reported. The 360-foot-tall futuristic complex is atop an old coffee warehouse on a spit of land jutting into the Elbe at one end of Hamburg's busy harbor. It will feature two concert halls, one with 2,150 seats; the other, 550, as well as a luxury hotel, bars and restaurants, apartments and a viewing platform.</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 5, 2007, Thursday  Because of an editing error, a report in the ''Arts, Briefly'' column on Tuesday about the Juno awards, Canada's equivalent of the Grammys, misidentified the site of the awards ceremony. It was Saskatoon, Saskatchewan -- not Toronto.</p>

        <p>Re ''Religion and Truth,'' by Stanley Fish (column, March 31):</p>
        <p>Just because religious texts make truth claims doesn't mean the Bible shouldn't be studied academically in schools. We need not ''bracket'' those claims any more than we do when we study sociology or chemistry.</p>
        <p>At the Catholic school where I teach, students explore different traditions and perspectives. One goal is a more thoughtful engagement with their own faith commitments.</p>
        <p>Right now, my world religions students are reading excerpts from the Bhagavad-Gita. Does the fact that none of them (so far) have accepted the lordship of Krishna make it pointless to study it?</p>
        <p>Al Grindon  Atlanta, March 31, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Advocacy and Teaching'' (column, March 24), Stanley Fish rightly railed against teachers who use classrooms as platforms for political advocacy. But in ''Religion and Truth'' (column, March 31), he scolds teachers in religious studies departments for adopting pedagogical strategies that avoid advocacy in the classroom.</p>
        <p>The problem stems from Mr. Fish's idea that absolutist belief claims are a religion's kernel, while its stories, practices and rituals are its shell. Religions are more like onions. They consist of layers of stories, practices, rituals, superstitions and yes, beliefs. There is no one ''kernel.''</p>
        <p>The academic study of religion ensures that college students are acquainted with these layers, and literate when it comes to the plurality of religious identities they encounter every day.</p>
        <p>Warren Frisina  Hempstead, N.Y., March 31, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is chairman of the religion department, Hofstra University.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Stanley Fish says that secularists who teach or study the Bible in schools ignore, or ''bracket,'' its most central parts, or its ''truth claims.'' He concludes by asking: ''But if you're going to cut the heart out of something, why teach it at all?''</p>
        <p>But there is a crucial difference between studying a religion's truth claims, or teaching what they are, and agreeing with them, or defending them as true.</p>
        <p>Does Mr. Fish think that Plato's ''Republic'' should not be studied or taught by those who believe in democracy, or that Bach's B minor Mass should not by studied or sung by atheists?</p>
        <p>Peter Achinstein  Baltimore, March 31, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of philosophy at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Most religions share a belief that God is transcendent, so human knowledge of God is limited and religious ''truth'' of any kind is at best an approximation. All religions share a quest for truth, with each being capable of reflecting some of God's glory but none able to express the fullness of divine truth.</p>
        <p>The human truth found in religion is best described as a family resemblance and not the simplistic all-or-nothing epistemology of Stanley Fish.</p>
        <p>(Rev.) Mitchell Brown  Wilmette, Ill., March 31, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Stanley Fish has less faith in the powers of liberal education than those who designed curriculums at American universities during the cold war. In that era, thousands of students were introduced to the thought of Marx through original texts. Perhaps some became Communists, but the overwhelming majority did not.</p>
        <p>If one can study Marx without becoming a Marxist, can one not study the Bible without becoming ''Judeo-Christian''?</p>
        <p>John Connelly  Kensington, Calif., March 31, 2007</p>

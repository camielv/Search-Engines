        <p>Representative Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Republican who has challenged his party to take a stronger stance against illegal immigration, formally declared his presidential candidacy here on Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tancredo held no rallies and delivered no political speeches on his first day as an official candidate. Instead, he made his announcement on Iowa's most prominent conservative radio talk show, saying he was entering the race because no other Republicans were going to make illegal immigration ''the primary issue of their campaign.''</p>
        <p>''The great tradition of the melting pot in America is not working,'' Mr. Tancredo said. ''The melting pot is cracked.''</p>
        <p>In an hourlong appearance on the show on WHO-AM, Mr. Tancredo fielded questions from the host, Jan Mickelson, as well as listeners, primarily on immigration. Mr. Tancredo said he chose the venue -- followed by more than 20 interviews throughout the day on stations across the country -- because talk radio had helped advance his views.</p>
        <p>''They're the ones who brought me into the party, so I'm going to dance with them,'' he said. ''It has given me a megaphone I never would have had.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tancredo, 61, has served in Congress since 1999, representing the Sixth District, largely south and east of Denver. For years, he has traveled across the country speaking against proposals by President Bush and other Republicans to initiate a guest-worker program to create a path for immigrants to live legally in the United States.</p>
        <p>He has focused much of his attention on Iowa, where the 2008 presidential race begins next year and where discontent over illegal immigrants working in packing plants and elsewhere has been percolating for years. His intention is to force other Republican candidates, particularly Senator John McCain of Arizona, former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, to address illegal immigration.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Tancredo, the field of formally declared Republican candidates expanded to six.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tancredo made his announcement as other candidates began disclosing their reports on fund-raising in the first quarter of 2007. He acknowledged that he did not have the money his rivals would have.</p>
        <p>''We have something they don't have: a group of people out there who are there because of an issue,'' Mr. Tancredo said. ''They're never going to have that. They can use their 100 million to try and buy constituency. I have it. It's natural. It's there.''</p>

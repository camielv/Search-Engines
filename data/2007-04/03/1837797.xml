        <p>The bidding yesterday lasted less than four minutes. The rare Stradivarius violin went for a high -- but not a record -- price of $2.4 million.</p>

        <p>The bidding yesterday lasted less than four minutes. The rare Stradivarius violin went for a high -- but not a record -- price of $2.4 million.</p>
        <p>There was a stirring in the packed auction room of Christie's in Rockefeller Center when Lot 255, the violin made by Antonio Stradivari in 1729 and the last item of the more than four-hour auction, was posted on the auction display.</p>
        <p>A dozen telephone operators alerted bidders on the phone; notice was also sent to Internet bidders; bidders at Christie's readied their numbered white auction paddles.</p>
        <p>The bidding started at $700,000 and rose quickly. A violin dealer on his cellphone whispered, presumably to a client, ''One million eight -- we're out, right?''</p>
        <p>Three minutes passed and the auctioneer, the wry Hugh Edmeades, paused and said, ''Waiting patiently at two point four million.'' Then he said ''fair warning'' and reached for his gavel. Someone blurted, ''Wait.'' Scattered laughter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edmeades did not say ''going once, going twice,'' but simply repeated the last bid once again. No further bids.</p>
        <p>The violin goes to someone, Mr. Edmeades declared, gaveling the sale to a close, ''in the room.''</p>
        <p>All eyes and cameras turned to a slightly startled man in gold-framed glasses and a gray suit, Ric Heinl, a violin dealer from Toronto.</p>
        <p>Are you the buyer? a cameraman asked. No, Mr. Heinl said. Can you name the buyer? No, he said, his client wants to remain anonymous. The final price, with Christie's commission, is $2.7 million.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Heinl's client gets for 2,775,294 Canadian dollars is what is known as a ''late period'' Stradivarius, which is not from Stradivari's ''golden period'' of 1700 to 1720. The record $3.5 million price last year was for such a golden violin.</p>
        <p>Like other violins, a Strad weighs little, less than 23 ounces, or about the weight of a regular box of raisin bran.</p>
        <p>And, like the surviving notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, Stradivarius violins are named for their owners.</p>
        <p>The one up for auction yesterday is known as ''The Solomon, Ex-Lambert.'' It was acquired in 1922 for about $5,000 for Dorothy Mary Murray Lambert, one of the few female violinists in Britain at the time. It was later acquired for $49,000 by Seymour Solomon, a founder of Vanguard Records, the label of Paul Robeson and Joan Baez.</p>
        <p>In due time, the Stradivarius will be known by a new name, perhaps Canadian.</p>

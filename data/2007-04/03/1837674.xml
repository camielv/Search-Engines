        <p>Listening to a patient's heart is a time-honored way for doctors to detect a variety of health problems. But it is not enough just to put a stethoscope to someone's chest, and studies have found that many doctors don't really know how to interpret what they are hearing.</p>

        <p>Listening to a patient's heart is a time-honored way for doctors to detect a variety of health problems. But it is not enough just to put a stethoscope to someone's chest, and studies have found that many doctors don't really know how to interpret what they are hearing.</p>
        <p>A new study suggests that a single session of auditory training can make a difference, at least for a while.</p>
        <p>The researchers, led by Dr. Michael J. Barrett, a cardiologist at the Temple University School of Medicine, took a group of general internists and tested their ability to detect heart murmurs. The average doctors got about 60 percent right.</p>
        <p>Then for 90 minutes, the doctors were given MP3 devices and asked to listen to five common heart murmurs 400 times.</p>
        <p>When retested, they got an average of about 80 percent right -- about the same as cardiologists, the researchers said.</p>
        <p>Other research has shown that the effect lasts about nine months, Dr. Barrett said.</p>
        <p>The murmurs that the doctors were trained to hear can indicate a number of problems. (Some can be heard at develop.temple.edu/temple--times/march07/DociPod.html.)</p>
        <p>But the doctors were also taught to recognize the most common murmur, known as the innocent murmur. It poses no health threat, but some people who have it must take precautions before some medical procedures.</p>
        <p>Doctors who misidentify it, however, may send patients for unnecessary tests. So it is important they trust their skills enough to tell a patient there is no problem, Dr. Barrett said.</p>
        <p>''They're going to hear that murmur every day,'' he said, ''so it was really important for them to be confident.''</p>

        <p>Sprint Nextel  ended a three-month review for its creative account by selecting Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group, for the assignment.</p>
        <p>Sprint Nextel spends $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion a year in advertising.</p>
        <p>The decision came Saturday after the review had been narrowed to Goodby, Silverstein and Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group. A third finalist, Y&amp;R Advertising, was eliminated last week.</p>
        <p>The Sprint Nextel creative account had been shared by two agencies. The goal of the review was to consolidate all creative assignments at a single agency, as Sprint Nextel consolidated its media account in 2006 at the MindShare unit of WPP.</p>
        <p>The two agencies sharing the creative assignment were TBWA/Chiat/Day in New York, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of Omnicom, and Publicis &amp; Hal Riney, part of the Publicis Groupe.</p>
        <p>TBWA/Chiat/Day created Sprint Nextel ads aimed at consumers; it withdrew from the review.</p>
        <p>Riney, which created ads aimed at business customers, decided against taking part in the review; Sprint Nextel described that as a mutual decision.</p>

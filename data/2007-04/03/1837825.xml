        <p>The ball rolled loose in the open floor, and a Florida guard was there to snatch it. Each time there was a quick pass to an open Gators shooter, a 3-point shot seemed to fall through the net.</p>
        <p>That is how it went for Florida on Monday night when it won its second consecutive N.C.A.A. tournament title with an 84-75 victory against Ohio State.</p>
        <p>Florida won with the pretty play -- the 3-pointer -- and it won with the hustle play -- diving after loose balls.</p>
        <p>''We definitely came up with almost all the loose balls tonight; that was the key to the game,'' point guard Taurean Green said. ''When they shot a 3 and we knew they were going to be long rebounds, we did a good job blocking out and chasing after long rebounds.''</p>
        <p>Florida outrebounded Ohio State, 38-28. Corey Brewer had eight of those rebounds. The Buckeyes would shoot a 3-pointer and miss, and the ball would fly back out where the Gators would control it.</p>
        <p>''That's the reason they beat us,'' Ohio State guard Jamar Butler said. ''They got every hustle play.''</p>
        <p>Buckeyes forward Ivan Harris, referring to his teammate Greg Oden, said, ''Greg is blocking shots, loose balls are rolling around, and they are picking them up and shooting 3s.''</p>
        <p>Florida's perimeter players -- Green, Brewer and Lee Humphrey -- took all 18 of the team's 3-pointers and made 10.</p>
        <p>It was a barrage of 3-pointers that broke open a 2-point game in the first half. In a 92-second stretch, Humphrey hit a 3, Brewer hit a 3, and Green hit a 3 to give the Gators a 33-22 lead.</p>
        <p>Ohio State made only 4 of 23 of 3-point attempts. Guards Ron Lewis, Mike Conley Jr. and Butler made only 2 of 13 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>Ohio State had a difficult time making 3s because Florida's defense was based outside-in. The Gators guarded the 3-point line and decided to play one-on-one in the post against Oden, the freshman star center.</p>
        <p>Oden scored 25 points, but his 2-pointers did not match up to Florida's 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>''We felt like we could play straight up in the post; 2s can't really beat you if you can guard the 3-point line,'' Brewer said. ''We let it go inside, played behind and made him try and get his. Defensively, we did good; we had each other's backs all night.''</p>
        <p>Ohio State has been able to manage its opponents' offense in this tournament with the help of a 2-3 zone defense, but the Buckeyes would not go into the zone against Florida's sharpshooters.</p>
        <p>''Zone or man-to-man, it wouldn't have made any difference,'' Harris said. ''They were just making shots.''</p>
        <p>Ohio State did not make shots, which is not surprising against Florida. Coming into the Final Four, opponents had shot only 29 percent from the 3-point line against the Gators.</p>
        <p>The Buckeyes were the latest team to be frustrated by the energetic play on the perimeter of the Florida guards.</p>
        <p>''Coach told us to keep shooting,'' Butler said. ''They just weren't falling.''</p>

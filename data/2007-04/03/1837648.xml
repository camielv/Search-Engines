        <p>"Preparing federal income tax returns based on falsehoods and fabrications is a serious violation of the law," Assistant Attorney General Eileen O'Connor said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Parsippany, N.J.-based Jackson Hewitt is the second-largest U.S. tax preparer. It did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The company's shares fell $2.12, or 6.5 percent, to $30.28 in afternoon trading.</p>

        <p>If Epiphanny Prince's recruiting pitch had been more persuasive, she and Shannon Bobbitt might both be playing in the Rutgers backcourt Tuesday night in the women's national championship game.</p>
        <p>Instead, these former teammates from Murry Bergtraum High in Lower Manhattan will be on the same court wearing different colors -- Prince in the scarlet of Rutgers and Bobbitt in the orange of Tennessee.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I should be talking to you,'' Bobbitt joked when she ran into Prince the other day at a Final Four banquet.</p>
        <p>''We don't even play each other,'' Prince replied.</p>
        <p>Now they will. Rutgers dispatched Louisiana State, 59-35, in one semifinal, and Tennessee finished with a 20-2 run to overcome North Carolina, 56-50, in the other semifinal.</p>
        <p>Yet, Prince and Bobbitt are far removed from the city and the state titles they won at Bergtraum in 2003 and 2004. They are at different universities and have become somewhat different players from those showtime days when Bobbitt would pass the ball between her legs to a trailing Prince for a fast-break basket that was meant to be as ostentatious as it was utilitarian.</p>
        <p>Prince, a freshman shooting guard, arrived at Rutgers with a gaudy résumé, having scored 113 points in a high school game, but she has become an eager defender. Bobbitt, a junior point guard, came to Tennessee as a pass-and-dribble playground flash, but she has developed a reliable shot from the perimeter. ''It's not like we can exploit each other's weaknesses,'' Prince said.</p>
        <p>At 5-foot-2, Bobbitt is the shortest scholarship player at Tennessee in Pat Summitt's 33 years as head coach, and only the third junior college transfer. The Lady Vols were in the market for a point guard after Sa'de Wiley-Greenwood transferred to Maryland in the middle of the 2005-6 season.</p>
        <p>At the time, Bobbitt was at Trinity Valley Community College in Texas, trying to boost her grades and get attention from Division I recruiters. The interest from Tennessee brought excitement and suspicion.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to make sure it was the Tennessee with the orange, with Pat Summitt,'' Bobbitt said.</p>
        <p>Assured that it was, she narrowed her choices to Tennessee, Rutgers and South Florida. Prince put on a full-court press for the Scarlet Knights, but Bobbitt decided that Rutgers already had more guards than Buckingham Palace. ''It's just business,'' Bobbitt said. ''I had to do what was best for my career.''</p>
        <p>She has brought quickness, speed, defensive relentlessness and confidence to the Lady Vols. Her presence has also allowed the 5-11 Alexis Hornbuckle to move to shooting guard, where she can rebound and post up against shorter players. In one season, Bobbitt has provided a vital missing piece in Tennessee's basketball puzzle.</p>
        <p>''A much-needed piece,'' according to Rutgers Coach C. Vivian Stringer. ''I think that was the smartest move that Tennessee could have made,'' she added. ''They have always had the giant players, what I call pro-sized guards, but they have never had the quickness that they have needed.''</p>
        <p>And after practicing 300 to 500 shots a day, Bobbitt has also developed a 3-point shot that she lacked in high school. Against Mississippi in the final of the Dayton Regional, she hit all three of her attempts from beyond the arc and scored 14 points.</p>
        <p>But perhaps Bobbitt's enthusiasm has been most infectious. Something Special, she is nicknamed, and Little Bit. She plays with a swagger that she traces to her days at Rucker Park and at playgrounds in Harlem, where ''you had to do something spectacular to get a nickname.''</p>
        <p>She also has a toughness to go with her flair. During Sunday's game against North Carolina, Bobbitt ran into a hard screen and was knocked to the floor. Dizzy, she went to the bench but quickly returned, telling Summitt, ''I have to go back in.''</p>
        <p>''I was born with knowing how to play hard,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And, she freely admits, knowing how to talk trash.</p>
        <p>The Lady Vols are not hesitant to bark at one another on the court. It is nothing personal, they insist, only exhortation to play better, the language of an assured team on the verge of a national championship.</p>
        <p>Sunday night, as Tennessee was on its way to shooting 17 for 63 and trailed by 48-36 with 8 minutes 18 seconds remaining, Bobbitt said that she became so desperate to avoid defeat, she began to say anything that popped into her head.</p>
        <p>With three and a half minutes left and the Lady Vols trailing by 50-48, Hornbuckle called for a newly-designed play to post up North Carolina's Ivory Latta. In Monday's retelling, Hornbuckle said that she and Bobbitt exchanged words and that Bobbitt told her, ''We're going to fight after this game, you keep talking to me like that.''</p>
        <p>In victory, this tense exchange melted into jubilant celebration. By Monday afternoon, Hornbuckle was laughing. And Bobbitt was looking ahead to playing against Rutgers and Prince, her former teammate.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to respect all of them, and not fear any of them,'' Bobbitt said.</p>

        <p>So thoroughly has Antonio Vivaldi's music become the near-exclusive province of period-instrument ensembles over the last two decades that it almost comes as a shock to see it turn up in a concert by an ensemble performing on modern implements. That's perhaps less true of his ''Four Seasons,'' music too picturesque and exuberant for most violinists to resist its charms. The latest to succumb is Joshua Bell, who came to Carnegie Hall on Sunday afternoon as leader of the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.</p>
        <p>It is worth remembering that the academy was at the forefront of the Baroque revival in the 1960s. Its 1969 recording of ''Four Seasons,'' with the violinist Alan Loveday, remains a reference version. There were numerous young faces in the group this afternoon, but collectively it still has Vivaldi in its blood. The wild card was Mr. Bell, who has not previously been associated with the Baroque repertory.</p>

        <p>So thoroughly has Antonio Vivaldi's music become the near-exclusive province of period-instrument ensembles over the last two decades that it almost comes as a shock to see it turn up in a concert by an ensemble performing on modern implements. That's perhaps less true of his ''Four Seasons,'' music too picturesque and exuberant for most violinists to resist its charms. The latest to succumb is Joshua Bell, who came to Carnegie Hall on Sunday afternoon as leader of the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.</p>
        <p>It is worth remembering that the academy was at the forefront of the Baroque revival in the 1960s. Its 1969 recording of ''Four Seasons,'' with the violinist Alan Loveday, remains a reference version. There were numerous young faces in the group this afternoon, but collectively it still has Vivaldi in its blood. The wild card was Mr. Bell, who has not previously been associated with the Baroque repertory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell stood at the center of the ensemble, crouching and lunging to provide cues. His solo work was polished and secure, with beautifully shaded dynamics and an expressive flexibility that lent his playing character. He dispatched torrid runs with breathtaking ease and provided an appealing sweetness to languid slow movements.</p>
        <p>Equally refined was the playing of the ensemble members, with the violinist Harvey de Souza, the cellist Stephen Orton and the harpsichordist John Constable making especially vital contributions. Bucking current orthodoxy, Mr. Bell and the academy players employed vibrato, tastefully and without exaggeration. When they abstained in the Adagio molto of the ''Autumn'' concerto, the clean, white sound that resulted stood out all the more.</p>
        <p>The second half was devoted to works by Tchaikovsky, music closer to the heart of Mr. Bell's repertory. An achingly melancholy Méditation from ''Souvenir d'un lieu cher'' was followed by a rich-toned account of the Serenade for Strings, which Mr. Bell led from the first violinist's chair. There was nothing wayward about the performance: the gracious music was allowed to speak for itself. A clamorous ovation earned an encore: a tasteful arrangement of Tchaikovsky's song ''None but the Lonely Heart.''</p>

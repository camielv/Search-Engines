      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>New Jersey Transit yesterday named Richard R. Sarles Sr. as its new executive director. Since 2002, Mr. Sarles has managed the agency's $1.3 billion annual capital program and its three light rail lines. Before that, he worked at Amtrak directing the Northeast Corridor High-Speed Rail program. One of Mr. Sarles's top priorities will be to oversee New Jersey Transit's drive to build a second passenger rail tunnel under the Hudson River. He will also inherit a planned 9.6 percent fare increase, which is expected to go into effect on June 1. Mr. Sarles succeeds George Warrington, who said he was leaving to pursue other opportunities.</p>

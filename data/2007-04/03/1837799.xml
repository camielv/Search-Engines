        <p>Three employees of Disney World were among 28 men arrested and charged with soliciting sex from a child in a four-day sting operation outside Orlando. Sheriff Grady Judd of Polk County said most of the men were arrested after arriving at a house where officers were waiting. The men had communicated online, and in some cases by phone, with undercover officers posing as girls as young as 13. The Disney employees were identified as Thierry Ferron, 44, an electronics technician; Julio Segundo, 21, an intern in research and development; and Richard Gaugh, 55, a regional coordinator for Disney's Animal Kingdom. A Disney spokeswoman said the three had been placed on unpaid leave.</p>

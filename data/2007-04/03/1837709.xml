        <p>Clothes don't make the man. At least in my case.</p>
        <p>I've been traversing the globe for about 25 years. And I've always been a creature of comfort. I have two suits that I love to travel in. Nothing on this earth can make those suits wrinkle. If a spot starts to look a little worn, I just dab some shoe polish on it to make it look less shiny. It works. Like I said, I'm not a fashion plate.</p>

        <p>Clothes don't make the man. At least in my case.</p>
        <p>I've been traversing the globe for about 25 years. And I've always been a creature of comfort. I have two suits that I love to travel in. Nothing on this earth can make those suits wrinkle. If a spot starts to look a little worn, I just dab some shoe polish on it to make it look less shiny. It works. Like I said, I'm not a fashion plate.</p>
        <p>But I am a self-confident guy. So I'm really surprised at the inordinate amount of time I spend worrying about my socks. I was in Kazakhstan the day after they opened their borders after the last election. I was picked up by two bodyguards who drove me through the mountains.</p>
        <p>We were met by some border guards in Kyrgyzstan who were straight out of central casting for the old cold war movies. Fortunately, our guards spoke Russian. But somewhere, floating around in my head, was this little niggling thought: Boy, I hope I have my good socks on in case we have some trouble.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I've learned how to do everything right. I pack light. I don't check bags if I don't have to. I buy travel-size shaving cream and toothpaste. But I've never really quite managed to remember to make sure I wear my good socks. Lately, that's obviously been more of an issue.</p>
        <p>On more than one occasion, in airports throughout the world, I've been the guy who had to remove his shoes. And that sets up a little bit of anxiety.</p>
        <p>The main reason is that I have to show my fellow travelers a pair of ratty socks with holes in each heel. I'm not that concerned about appearances, and I think you have to have a lot of self-confidence to carry off that threadbare look. I'm not quite there yet.</p>
        <p>I've made some headway. The shelf where I keep my socks is now in order. Unfortunately, about 80 percent of the socks I own are of the threadbare variety. I've bought new socks, but it's not like they last forever. So I'm always hoping that I pick the right ones.</p>
        <p>I log about 100,000 miles a year in travel. I've managed to deal with food poisoning, missed flights, navigating cultural differences and all of the other challenges that business travelers face. But I can't seem to deal with my socks.</p>
        <p>I think it all goes back to my mom. She would iron my underwear, just in case I got into an accident.</p>
        <p>So I'm coping with a lot of guilt in not living up to those standards.</p>
        <p>I've always been of the belief that being successful in business means that you have a responsibility to give something back to society. And my company certainly does do that. But I think one of the lesser gifts that I may give to the world is to keep investing in new socks.</p>
        <p>I think that would make moms throughout the world happy, too.</p>

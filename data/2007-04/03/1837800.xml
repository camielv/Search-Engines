        <p>The new conservator of the troubled Texas Youth Commission, Jay Kimbrough, has identified 552 juveniles due or overdue for release from custody and will begin freeing them tomorrow, said Jim Hurley, a spokesman for the revamped commission. Most will be supervised on parole. The group does not include additional hundreds of the more than 4,000 other confined youths whose cases will be reviewed by a special panel to see why their minimum sentences have been extended. Investigators are reviewing at least 1,200 complaints of sexual abuse and other mistreatment of juveniles in state custody.</p>

        <p>8 P.M. (13, 49) KINGS OF CAMOUFLAGE -- They may sound more ''Star Trek'' than sea life, but cuttlefish, above, can impersonate the opposite sex; change their shape and color to blend in with their environment; and kill faster than you can say ''beam me up.'' This ''Nova'' special goes in depth to see how intelligent these versatile beings are.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Discovery Times) THE CHOCOLATE WARS -- In a branding rivalry even sweeter than Coke versus Pepsi, Hershey and Mars battle to be the No. 1 fulfiller of America's chocolate cravings.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13, 49) SO MUCH SO FAST -- When Lou Gehrig's disease was diagnosed in Stephen Heywood when he was 29, he and his family began a passionate fight against the affliction. His brother started a foundation that so aggressively sought a cure that it was met with both high praise and severe criticism. This ''Frontline'' documentary follows the Heywood family through its struggle.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) HOUSE -- A pregnant celebrity photographer's health declines rapidly after she collapses during a photo shoot for a musician (Tyson Ritter of All-American Rejects as himself). When House recommends aborting the fetus to save her life and the photographer refuses, he finds himself at odds with Cuddy. Also, Cameron and Chase are busted.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Discovery) DEADLIEST CATCH -- Crab looks so benign on a plate covered in sauce, but fishing for it is one of the most dangerous jobs out there. The crews set out from Dutch Harbor, Alaska, in the season premiere of this Emmy-nominated series.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (FX) THE SHIELD -- Vic (Michael Chiklis, right) is consumed with finding Lem's killer; Claudette (CCH Pounder) is determined to get him off the case; and Kavanaugh (Forest Whitaker) will go to any length to pin the murder on Vic. Meanwhile, Claudette has reason to believe the Barn's future is in jeopardy in the sixth-season premiere of this acclaimed drama.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Discovery) ROGUE NATURE -- With people encroaching farther and farther into bears' natural habitat, the animals may be adapting by using humans as a food source.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (ABC) BOSTON LEGAL -- Denny (William Shatner) and the staff at Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt are held hostage by a man convinced that a murderer got away thanks to the young Denny, played by  the young Mr. Shatner, thanks to scenes from a 50-year-old pilot, ''The Defender,'' that featured him.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (National Geographic) THE FINAL REPORT: COLUMBINE -- Nearly eight years ago the aftermath of a shooting rampage at Columbine High School in Colorado was broadcast across the world. This special looks at what happened and why, before, during and after the killings.</p>

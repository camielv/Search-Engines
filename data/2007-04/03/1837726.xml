        <p>Russia's national airline, Aeroflot, made a surprise bid on Monday for all or part of Italy's national airline, Alitalia, as one of three potential buyers to meet a deadline set by the Italian ministry of finance.</p>
        <p>If successful, Aeroflot's bid for the Italian flag carrier would be its first large investment outside the former Soviet Union, and it would be in keeping with a trend of Russian state-owned businesses making strategic investments in Europe.</p>
        <p>Aeroflot joined with Italy's largest bank, UniCredit, to bid for most of the 49 percent stake in Alitalia now held by the Italian finance ministry, which is selling its shares in hopes that a private owner will have better luck reviving the money-losing airline.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the tender, potential buyers must agree to acquire more than 30 percent of Alitalia while also making an offer to minority shareholders to buy the entire airline, which has a market capitalization of $1.74 billion.</p>
        <p>The ability of Aeroflot, which has a market value of about $3.2 billion, to bid at all suggests the extent of the airline's recovery after its long post-Soviet doldrums.</p>
        <p>Analysts, however, questioned the logic of combining the Russian carrier with Alitalia. ''Aeroflot is just coming out of its own lengthy tailspin and a restructuring of its own'' after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, said Peter Morris, chief economist with Ascend, an aviation industry consultancy in London.</p>
        <p>Sergio Ermotti, director of investment banking at UniCredit, said that a second airline might join Aeroflot's bid if Italian regulators allowed an exception to Monday's deadline.</p>
        <p>The Russians could be competing with two other potential buyers: a team comprising the Texas Pacific Group, MatlinPatterson and the Italian bank Mediobanca; and AP Holding, representing the Italian tycoon Carlo Toto, who owns Alitalia's domestic competitor, Air One.</p>
        <p>Texas Pacific has a track record of airline turnarounds; the group bought Continental Airlines in the early 1990s and returned it to profitability. Elsewhere in Europe, Texas Pacific is currently bidding for the Spanish airline Iberia.</p>
        <p>If it wins the bid for the Italian carrier, Aeroflot could allow Alitalia to fly valuable routes through Europe with modern airplanes bought without paying high Russian customs fees and value-added tax, said Elena Sakhnova, a transportation analyst at UFG Deutsche Bank in Moscow.</p>
        <p>''Russia has a lot of oil wealth that is all dressed up and looking for a place to party,'' Mr. Morris of Ascend said.</p>

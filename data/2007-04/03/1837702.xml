        <p>Leaders of Senate and House subcommittees overseeing NASA called for removal of its inspector general on Monday, saying he had abused his authority and created a hostile workplace that interfered with his office's doing its job.</p>
        <p>In a letter to President Bush, Representative Brad Miller, a North Carolina Democrat who heads the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of the House Science and Technology Committee, and Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who heads the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Aeronautics and Related Matters, called for removal of the NASA official, Robert W. Cobb.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cobb, a former White House ethics lawyer who was appointed inspector general in 2002, has been the subject of an investigation by the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency on charges that he retaliated against whistle-blowers and failed to look properly into safety and security issues.</p>
        <p>Representative Bart Gordon, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the full House Science and Technology Committee, said the investigation showed that Mr. Cobb created a work environment where subordinates were afraid to speak out and maintained too close a relationship with top NASA officials whom he should have been scrutinizing.</p>
        <p>''If whistle-blowers and the inspector general's own staff do not feel that they can trust him or work with him, he cannot possibly be effective,'' Mr. Gordon said. Mr. Cobb could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>David Mould, a NASA spokesman, said the agency administrator, Michael D. Griffin, had reviewed the investigators' report and made his recommendations on March 14. Mr. Griffin acknowledged concerns about management and supervisory issues in the inspector general's office and said he had taken action to address them, Mr. Mould said.</p>
        <p>''The recommendations from Mr. Griffin do not include removal from office,'' Mr. Mould said, adding that Mr. Griffin found Mr. Cobb ''technically sound and fully engaged in his work.'' Mr. Mould said the report did not indicate that Mr. Cobb's methods had compromised investigations that affected space flight safety.</p>

        <p>Children who suffer a head injury are much more likely to have another one within six months, researchers reported yesterday. The big question is why.</p>
        <p>Writing in Pediatrics, the researchers said the children they had studied were twice as likely as other children to injure their heads again. The study was led by Bonnie R. Swaine of the University of Montreal.</p>
        <p>Until now, the study said, there has been some circumstantial evidence suggesting that one head injury predisposes children to another. Trying to determine if this was really the case, the researchers looked at what happened to more than 11,800 children, ages 1 to 18, who came to two pediatric emergency rooms over a little more than two years for treatment of a head injury.</p>
        <p>Although the researchers were unable to establish what kind of children were at most risk to be injured again -- beyond the well-known fact that boys are more likely to have injuries than girls -- they suggested that repeated injuries probably involved a ''complex interaction between children and their personal and social environments.''</p>
        <p>To begin with, a mild head injury can cause continuing problems that may not be obvious. ''Even subtle deficits in coordination, balance or endurance,'' the study said, ''combined with cognitive and behavioral limitations, might reduce a child's ability to meet the demands of a difficult task.''</p>
        <p>It may also be, the researchers said, that the children who are injured again are exposed to more hazardous environments or have less parental supervision.</p>
        <p>The study recommended that families of children who have had head injuries might benefit from counseling on injury prevention. It also said doctors might consider extending the four-week restriction on activity that patients are often advised to follow.</p>

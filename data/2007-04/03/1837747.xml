        <p>When the mother of an unemployed 20-year-old man tried to evict him from her Long Island home on Sunday, he killed her and his father, shooting them in the head, the Nassau County police said on Monday.</p>
        <p>Investigators said that the man, Franklin Gallimore III, was being held in the deaths, and that he would be arraigned on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Detective Lt. Michael Fleming, chief of the homicide squad, said Mr. Gallimore's girlfriend, Katherina Galatro, 18, would be charged because ''she provided some assistance to the boyfriend in escaping and hiding out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gallimore had been living with his mother at 1310 Post Avenue, between Meacham and Evans Avenues, in Elmont. The police identified the mother as Grace Thorpe, 41, an accountant. A phone directory also listed her as Grace Thorpe-Peddie.</p>
        <p>The police said that she and Mr. Gallimore had been arguing over his behavior, and that she demanded he move out.</p>
        <p>In response, the police said, the son took out a revolver and fired one shot at his mother and another at his father shortly before 6 p.m., then fled with his girlfriend. Hours later, at a motel in Suffolk County, the police said, they spotted the black Mercedes-Benz that they believed he was driving and took him and his girlfriend into custody.</p>
        <p>''She was having a problem with his lifestyle and wanted him out of the house,'' Detective Fleming said. ''He was being evicted, basically.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference at Police Headquarters here in Garden City on Monday, Detective Fleming said that the son ''was not living up to his mother's expectations'' and that ''the girlfriend had been staying there, mostly without the mother's permission.''</p>
        <p>The suspect's father, Franklin Gallimore Jr., had been living elsewhere but was at the house to help Ms. Thorpe get their son to leave and may even have planned to change the locks, Detective Fleming said. He described the father as a construction worker who was disabled and lived in Central Islip. The marital status of the parents was unclear, the police said.</p>
        <p>Moments after the shootings, neighbors called the police to report that they had heard gunfire, Detective Fleming said. When the officers arrived, they found the victims in the kitchen, already dead.</p>
        <p>Investigators sought the son and his girlfriend for questioning and alerted neighboring police departments to be on the lookout for the car. Detective Fleming said two Suffolk County police officers spotted the car parked at the Broadway Motor Inn on Route 110 in Farmingdale.</p>
        <p>The police said they evacuated the rest of the motel, and then the son and his girlfriend were taken into custody without incident.</p>
        <p>Investigators said they recovered a gun that they believe was the murder weapon.</p>
        <p>One neighbor voiced surprise at the killings. ''They seemed very nice,'' said Patricia Buongervino, a 50-year resident. She said that she was unaware of any problems at Ms. Thorpe's home, and that she had seen the son on Saturday. ''He seemed happy. He was smiling.''</p>

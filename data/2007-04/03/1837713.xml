        <p>You have probably seen the sickening security video of the attack. A man, who has yet to be caught, punched Ms. Morat several times before taking her money. This creep, the police believe, then did the same thing several blocks away, attacking Solange Elizee, 85.</p>

        <p>Among state officials, there is a pattern of balkanizing crime by creating all sorts of special categories of victims Â— the latest being the elderly.</p>

        <p>Any New Yorker with a sliver of decency was disgusted by the recent mugging of a 101-year-old woman, Rose Morat, in the lobby of her Queens apartment building.</p>
        <p>You have probably seen the sickening security video of the attack. A man, who has yet to be caught, punched Ms. Morat several times before taking her money. This creep, the police believe, then did the same thing several blocks away, attacking Solange Elizee, 85.</p>
        <p>Both women bounced back admirably from their ordeal, displaying the kind of guts that the mugger thoroughly lacked. But outrage over the assaults lingers.</p>
        <p>In Albany, it has led some officials to push the ''oughta be a law'' buttons that seem to be attached to their desks. The buttons tend to be pressed hard after a stomach-churning episode that receives a great deal of attention.</p>
        <p>Last week, the State Senate passed what some are calling the ''granny bill.'' It would raise the stakes for thugs who prey on ''vulnerable elderly persons.'' No longer would they be able to skate by on possible misdemeanor charges. The bill would make this sort of crime an automatic felony, carrying a prison sentence of perhaps as much as seven years.</p>
        <p>The definition of ''elderly'' is somewhat expansive, encompassing people far younger than 101 or even 85. Felony charges would kick in if the victim is 70 or older, or even as young as 60 but with ''demonstrable'' signs of ''a disease or infirmity associated with advanced age.'' Such ailments include Alzheimer's disease, dementia and cancer, said State Senator Martin J. Golden, a Brooklyn Republican who is the bill's chief sponsor.</p>
        <p>The idea is ''to send a message, and send it with some real teeth in it,'' Mr. Golden said. ''You need to be able to keep society safe. That's our role as legislators, and this is one way of doing that.''</p>
        <p>For now, the State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, is unconvinced. ''We're looking at it,'' Sisa Moyo, a spokeswoman for Mr. Silver, said of the Senate bill. ''There are things that we think can be done better.'' What might they be? That was not made clear. This bill, however, seems unlikely to become law any time soon.</p>
        <p>Whatever the ultimate outcome, Albany's tendencies are already plain. There is a pattern of balkanizing crime by creating all sorts of special categories of victims.</p>
        <p>Be they liberals or conservatives, many lawmakers believe that no matter what the 14th Amendment says about ''equal protection of the laws,'' some victims are more equal than others. And therefore some criminals deserve harsher punishment than others who commit exactly the same offenses.</p>
        <p>Liberals tend to favor hate-crime laws, which add extra penalties for misdeeds that are already crimes if the offenders are motivated by racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia or other prejudices. To critics of the laws, these criminals are punished more severely not for their actions but for harboring thoughts deemed impure by society.</p>
        <p>On the conservative flip side, recent laws put some sexual predators into a criminal class of their own. Even after they have completed their prison sentences -- paid their debt to society, if you will -- they can be confined for many years because they are deemed serious risks, likely to strike again.</p>
        <p>SUPPORTERS of these laws say, correctly, that the recidivism rate is high among such offenders. Still, it is hard not think of the short story and film ''Minority Report,'' in which people are arrested for suspected future crimes they have yet to commit.</p>
        <p>Now we have older people in a special category.</p>
        <p>But what is ''old'' these days? Surely you know sturdy 70-year-olds who could go toe-to-toe with a mugger. Do they need enhanced legal protection more than, say, a frail 69-year-old? As for 60, we keep hearing how it is the new 50, a point that probably could be made even about some of that age who are ailing.</p>
        <p>How, then, if the goal is to deter an attack, is a mugger supposed to know on sight that his victim enjoys special protection? Would he perhaps be well-advised to first ask the victim for proof of age?</p>
        <p>If so, you know what's coming next. A new kind of crime will arise: trafficking in fake identification, not for bar-hopping teenagers but for baby boomers who are shy of 60 and want to appear older as an anticrime ploy (and maybe also as a way to buy cheaper movie tickets).</p>
        <p>You think some enterprising soul out there is not already considering the possibilities?</p>

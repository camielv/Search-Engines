        <p>The National Football League has postponed the preseason game between New England and Seattle that was scheduled for Beijing this summer, choosing instead to focus on the first regular-season game to be played outside North America. That game, between the Giants and Miami, will be played Oct. 28 in London. Staging two games overseas in less than three months threatened to stretch the resources of the N.F.L. The China game was rescheduled for 2009.</p>

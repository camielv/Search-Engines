        <p>Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday that it was pointless for Democrats to pursue Iraq spending measures that set a timeline for leaving Iraq that President Bush would veto. Meanwhile, the top Senate Democrat signed on to a measure that would cut off money for the war next March if the president exercised his veto.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a fund-raiser in Birmingham, Ala., for Senator Jeff Sessions, Mr. Cheney said the president was determined to reject any legislation establishing such a timeline. He warned that the Pentagon would begin feeling the financial pinch this month if new financing was not approved.</p>

        <p>Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday that it was pointless for Democrats to pursue Iraq spending measures that set a timeline for leaving Iraq that President Bush would veto. Meanwhile, the top Senate Democrat signed on to a measure that would cut off money for the war next March if the president exercised his veto.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a fund-raiser in Birmingham, Ala., for Senator Jeff Sessions, Mr. Cheney said the president was determined to reject any legislation establishing such a timeline. He warned that the Pentagon would begin feeling the financial pinch this month if new financing was not approved.</p>
        <p>''It's time the self-appointed strategists on Capitol Hill understood a very simple concept: You cannot win a war if you tell the enemy when you're going to quit,'' Mr. Cheney said.</p>
        <p>But the administration's stance did not deter Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, who announced that if the president vetoed the timeline measures, he would support legislation sponsored by Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, that would end spending for most troops by March 31, 2008.</p>
        <p>''If the president vetoes the supplemental appropriations bill and continues to resist changing course in Iraq, I will work to ensure this legislation receives a vote in the Senate in the next work period,'' Mr. Reid said.</p>
        <p>At the moment, such a measure could not win approval in the Senate, where many Democrats are reluctant to back a definitive cutoff.</p>
        <p>But it represents another step in the Democratic effort to increase the pressure on Mr. Bush and helps Mr. Reid reward Mr. Feingold for sticking with the party on narrowly approved legislation that established March 31, 2008, as a goal for withdrawal.</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>SHEEHAN--Philip T. (Skip), 76, on March 31. Born August 31, 1930, Skip, a graduate of Brooklyn Prep and Manhattan College, spent his career in banking, starting with the Irving Trust Company in 1956. Skip's sense of humor and easy laughter enlivened many family gatherings, where he loved to reminisce about Brooklyn and summers at the Reservation in Long Branch. Skip's family often said he was a gentleman, which he truly was -gentle man who laughed often and rarely said a harsh word. He will be sorely missed. The 10th of 14 children of George and Loretto Sheehan, Skip is survived by his sisters, Sister Mary Sheehan, RSCJ, Fran Fountain, Liz Sheehan, and his brother, Mike. He is also survived by his son Rome and his wife Maria, his daughter Traci and her husband Chris Van Thull, his daughter Susan and her husband Ted Ferguson, his son Tim and his wife Sarah, and eight grandchildren. John E. Day Funeral Home, Red Bank, NJ, is in charge of services.</p>

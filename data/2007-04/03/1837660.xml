        <p>It was fitting that Cesc Gelabert should close the dance component of ''Made in Catalunya,'' a festival celebrating the rich, idiosyncratic Catalan cultural history. Mr. Gelabert is one of the earliest modern-dance artists of a generation based in Barcelona that came of age in the 1980s. He is also sui generis, as his solo, ''Glimpse,'' suggested in a performance on Saturday night at the Baryshnikov Arts Center.</p>
        <p>In ''Glimpse,'' set to a score by Carlos Miranda, Mr. Gelabert danced in front of a handsome video created by Charles Atlas, sometimes interacting with the images. Program notes described those images as representing the performer's thoughts and emotions, but it was never clear exactly what Mr. Gelabert might be thinking or feeling as blocky forms used in computer choreography sprawled, reached and twisted behind him -- along with abstract patterns, replications of himself dancing and a variety of odd objects, including a tomato, an orange and a large snail amid mushrooms. (At one point, the live Mr. Gelabert reached toward a screen full of fire, and a slow-slithering snake crawled from where his finger pointed.)</p>

        <p>Mr. Gelabert momentarily sprouted from the snail's shell. That moment of laughter was welcome, and his final bows suggested he has a wry, sweet sense of humor as he spotted friends in the audience and smiled at them. The hourlong solo was otherwise a little dry and lacked spontaneity.</p>
        <p>The point of Mr. Gelabert's performing and choreographic style has long seemed to be the way he moves and looks onstage. In ''Glimpse'' he was as fluid as ever, his gestures clear, acute and even poetic and his gaze piercing. Here, he had the look of a particularly ascetic guru, lean, agile and able, it seems, to unlock the secrets of the universe. But one secret remained unrevealed in ''Glimpse,'' and that was the inner life of the performer.</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>After four days on the stand, the primary witness in a judicial bribery case finished his direct testimony yesterday, describing a series of gifts and cash payments made in exchange for legal assignments and favorable rulings. The defendant, Gerald Garson, a former State Supreme Court justice who oversaw matrimonial cases, has been charged with accepting bribes. The witness, a disbarred divorce lawyer named Paul Siminovsky, left, testified that he paid for meals for the judge and gave him a bottle of Scotch and other gifts as well as an envelope holding $1,000. On a surveillance recording played in State Supreme Court yesterday, the judge was seen accepting the money, then counting it and muttering profanities. On the recording, the judge returned the money and asked that it be given to his wife's political campaign. Mr. Siminovsky gave the money back to the judge, clapping his arm and saying, ''Don't worry about it.'' Mr. Siminovsky has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.</p>

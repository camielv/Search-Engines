        <p>The Metavante Corporation, a financial processing firm, would become its own company under a deal being completed by its parent company, the Milwaukee bank Marshall &amp; Ilsley, and the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, according to people with knowledge of the plans.</p>
        <p>Metavante handles customer relationships and financial transactions, like online bill payments, for banks.</p>
        <p>Under a proposed tax-free transaction, Metavante would be spun off to shareholders, and Warburg Pincus would pay cash for a minority stake. Financial details were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Marshall &amp; Ilsley, founded in 1847, operates retail banking offices in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nevada, Arizona and Florida.</p>
        <p>Financial institutions have been under pressure to spin off their processing arms as a way of increasing returns to shareholders. Last year, First Data spun off Western Union, its global money transfer business, to focus on its struggling credit card and debit card transaction business.</p>
        <p>The hedge fund manager William A. Ackman also is pushing for a spinoff of Comdata, a fast-growing division of the business services firm Ceridian. And Synovus Financial Corporation has been under pressure to spin off its credit-processing arm, Total System Services.</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A Clinton Township police officer was arrested yesterday on a gun charge after he took a shotgun from a relative's house and headed for Somerset County in his truck, the county prosecutor's office said. Around 10:30 a.m., a countywide alert was issued for the officer, Jason Peltack, after a friend called the police and told them that the officer had taken a 12-gauge shotgun from a home in Bridgewater. As a precaution, the prosecutor's office ordered Immaculata High School in Somerville to be locked down for about an hour, said Wayne J. Forrest, the Somerset County prosecutor. Mr. Forrest would not say why the school was thought to be in danger or how the officer had planned to use the gun. Officer Peltack, 27, was arrested around 11:20 a.m. in Raritan and charged with a fourth-degree firearms offense. He was placed on paid medical leave and ordered to undergo a psychological evaluation, the authorities said.</p>

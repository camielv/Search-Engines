        <p>Re ''Scientists Hope Vigilance Stymies Avian Flu Mutations'' (March 27): Several important concerns should keep avian flu on our radar. First, as stated, the virus is continually changing, so at no point in this ongoing process is a potentially pandemic form less likely to surface. Second, the threat does not end with H5N1 in birds. There are many potentially dangerous versions of avian influenza.</p>

        <p>What has changed is our capacity to find this and other infectious agents through a coordinated global monitoring network. This system has resulted through new public and private partnerships, and through collaborative efforts with other nations. These are positive steps, but they may prove meaningless if our vigilance falls off due to a false sense of security.</p>

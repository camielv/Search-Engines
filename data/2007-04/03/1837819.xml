        <p>The rape convictions of a Buffalo man incarcerated for more than 21 years were vacated yesterday, five days after prosecutors announced that newly discovered evidence had linked another man to the attacks. The man, Anthony Capozzi, 50, was not in court for the hearing, during which Judge Shirley Troutman of Erie County Court ordered his release. Mr. Capozzi, who is schizophrenic and is being treated at a state prison hospital in Marcy, was convicted of two rapes in the early 1980s. He was released after prosecutors said that another man's DNA matched the DNA samples from the rapes. That man, Altemio Sanchez, cannot be charged with the rapes because of the statute of limitations, which was five years at the time, prosecutors said. Mr. Sanchez has been charged with three murders in the Buffalo area since 1990. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>

        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he intended to veto a bill that would prohibit the use of metal bats in high school baseball games. ''I don't know whether aluminum bats are more dangerous or less dangerous'' than wooden bats, the mayor said. ''I have had friends who are professional baseball players call me and argue both ways, but I don't think it's the city's business to regulate that.'' The Council passed the bill on March 14 by a vote of 40 to 6; 34 votes would be required to override a veto. The bill's main sponsor, Councilman James S. Oddo, said, ''We'll have a second vote, and there will be a second opportunity for the City Council to stand up on behalf of the kids.''</p>

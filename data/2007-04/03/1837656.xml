        <p>First-time operagoers and long-term fans are drawn to different aspects of opera. First-timers may be pulled in by the excitement of the event: the big music, the spectacle. And in these respects, the Metropolitan Opera's ''Turandot,'' which returned on Friday night, certainly passes muster. Franco Zeffirelli's production delivers a lot of bang (scenery, costumes, number of bodies on stage) for the buck, and in the hands of the ever-impressive conductor Fabio Luisi, the orchestra and the chorus sounded great. And Puccini's music is pretty hot.</p>
        <p>But fans who know the opera well tend to look for exciting voices as the leads. And here Friday's ''Turandot'' fell short. Andrea Gruber is always a committed singer, but on Friday she sounded wobbly and thin in the title role. Richard Margison, the tenor who sang Calaf, can pump out sound, but the effort was audible, though he rose to the occasion for the greatest-hit moment, ''Nessun dorma.''</p>

        <p>First-time operagoers and long-term fans are drawn to different aspects of opera. First-timers may be pulled in by the excitement of the event: the big music, the spectacle. And in these respects, the Metropolitan Opera's ''Turandot,'' which returned on Friday night, certainly passes muster. Franco Zeffirelli's production delivers a lot of bang (scenery, costumes, number of bodies on stage) for the buck, and in the hands of the ever-impressive conductor Fabio Luisi, the orchestra and the chorus sounded great. And Puccini's music is pretty hot.</p>
        <p>But fans who know the opera well tend to look for exciting voices as the leads. And here Friday's ''Turandot'' fell short. Andrea Gruber is always a committed singer, but on Friday she sounded wobbly and thin in the title role. Richard Margison, the tenor who sang Calaf, can pump out sound, but the effort was audible, though he rose to the occasion for the greatest-hit moment, ''Nessun dorma.''</p>
        <p>For a die-hard voice lover, only Hei-Kyung Hong, as Liù, was really worth the price of admission. She is reliably radiant in this role, delivering clear pianissimi. The seams showed a little; there were moments when a less experienced singer might have been unable to hold a note she managed to cling to. But she still gave the illusion of floating purity.</p>
        <p>Without exciting leads (except Ms. Hong), some of the smaller performances came into sharper focus: Earle Patriarco's warm Ping; Charles Anthony's querulous Emperor Altoum, with a thin nasality that echoed the actual Peking opera style and worked very well; Oren Gradus's respectable Timur.</p>
        <p>I even found myself musing on the Zeffirelli production and its monstrous set that leaves so little room for its people. With a flattened perspective reflecting the two-dimensionality of a Chinese painting, it thrusts the chorus to its edges, leaving only narrow walkways and islands for selected dancers and principals; the pomp of royalty is prioritized, with hoi polloi admitted as an afterthought.</p>
        <p>China is a dark world, shot through with veins of bright color and moments when the stage is flooded with light. The Met's other Chinese opera this season, ''The First Emperor,'' was a pendant to this ''Turandot,'' both visually and in its Pucciniesque timbres. It's just too bad the operatic China couldn't, on Friday, have been more musically satisfying.</p>
        <p>''Turandot'' runs through May 8 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center; (212) 362-6000 or metopera.org.</p>

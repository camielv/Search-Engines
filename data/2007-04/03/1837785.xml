        <p>Re ''A Tale of Power and Intrigue in the Lab, Based on Real Life'' (March 27): While certainly not condoning the murder of faculty mentors by their graduate students, I can appreciate the frustration that a student must feel, particularly after a long time in graduate school, when his hopes for an advanced degree are dashed. When I was a graduate in the late '40s, the path was clear. First, candidacy exams were taken, and then qualifying exams to see whether the student could proceed to the Ph.D. or be satisfied with an M.S.</p>

        <p>True, even at that time, certain professors demanded a seven- to nine-year stay for the degree, but they were for the most part avoided. As for tenure after years of teaching, but being turned down by your peers, this indicates that academia, for the most part, is a jungle ruled by emotion and politics.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was in Iowa City when the physics graduate student Gang Lu shot and killed five members of the University of Iowa community. Every time I pass Van Allen Hall, I pause at the plaque with the names of the deceased. To have a filmmaker recreate this horrible event and make the Gang Lu character ''sunnier'' than the real Gang Lu and put ''much of the onus of being the bad guy'' on one of the advisers Gang Lu killed is utterly despicable.</p>

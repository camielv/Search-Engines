        <p>An academic conference on the state of the middle class became a mini-rehearsal for the 2009 mayor's race yesterday, with three probable candidates outlining their priorities -- and occasionally jousting -- on how to attract and retain moderate-income New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>Organized by the Drum Major Institute for Public Policy and the Baruch School of Public Affairs, the half-day conference on whether the city was still hospitable to moderate-income New Yorkers examined the growing sense, and the numbers behind it, that it has become much more difficult to lead a middle-class life in the city.</p>
        <p>In opening remarks, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said it was now impossible for a family of seven, with one wage earner, to thrive in the city as his did in Queens in the 1950s and '60s. John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York Graduate Center, presented statistics outlining what he called the paradox of growing inequality amid overall prosperity.</p>
        <p>But the contest to succeed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- an election 31 months away -- was never far from the surface, owing to the presence of the Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrión; the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr.; and Representative Anthony D. Weiner. Even the name of Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, also a presumed candidate, came up several times.</p>
        <p>The three men sought to establish their middle-class bona fides, telling personal ''I've been there'' stories and prescribing similar solutions to attract and retain the diminishing middle class. Those included increasing the availability of low-cost housing, improving the quality of public education, changing tax policies and helping small businesses to provide more jobs.</p>
        <p>There were substantive and stylistic differences on display as well, especially between Mr. Carrión and Mr. Weiner, who appeared on a panel together and clashed over everything from how the news media cover government policies to whether certain tax cuts would be effective.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiner, a candidate for mayor in 2005, took much the same stance as he did in that race, presenting himself as the champion of the middle class and the one who speaks its language. In contrast, Mr. Carrión appeared to be positioning himself as a business-oriented, pro-growth moderate, saying that government subsidies should be seen as investments, not charity.</p>
        <p>''What's troubling to me is that for all of our worshiping at the altar of the middle class as a rhetorical device, I think it's important that we in government talk to those people,'' Mr. Weiner said at one point, adding that voters had responded positively to a tax cut he had proposed in the mayor's race by ''asking those that make more than $1 million to pay a little bit more.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carrión shot back, not so subtly deriding that proposal.</p>
        <p>''When politicians are at the altar of the middle class worshiping, as you suggest, and we approach this part of our audience and insult their intelligence by suggesting that a small, fractional, lunch-money income tax break is going to help them and qualitatively improve their prospects to stay or enter the middle class, I think we are at a very dangerous place,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The two also jostled over the idea of discount stores like Wal-Mart, which Mr. Weiner has fought, moving into low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Mr. Carrión, who negotiated a deal for a BJ's Wholesale Club at a new mall in the Bronx, suggested that the presence of such stores was inevitable.</p>
        <p>''To think that price competition, we're going to keep it out, I mean, you know, somebody else will come up with something else,'' he said. ''Wal-Mart, you know, it's the flavor of the moment, but it'll emerge as something else because those forces in our marketplace are real.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiner jumped in, saying of the term ''price competition,'' ''I don't know what exactly that means.'' He added that citizens and government and labor officials would need to decide ''what type of entities we want in our city.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson spoke on an earlier panel, and escaped the sparring. He emphasized the need to eliminate what he called the ''barbell effect,'' with ''low-income people and higher-income people expanding, and those in the middle being squeezed.'' He spoke of the need to revise taxes to help small businesses and self-employed people and to improve education, but he saved some of his strongest comments for housing.</p>
        <p>''There isn't a room in this city that you will go in and talk about rising costs and stress in housing that heads won't nod up and down and people aren't scared,'' he said. ''Particularly, middle-income New Yorkers are scared of being priced out of their own neighborhoods, the neighborhoods that they stayed in and helped to develop over a period of decades.''</p>

        <p>The government will seek to execute a reputed crime family boss accused of killing an associate, federal prosecutors said yesterday in pretrial court documents.</p>
        <p>The defendant, Vincent Basciano, known as Vinny Gorgeous for his onetime ownership of a hair salon in the Bronx, has been described by prosecutors as a former acting boss of the Bonanno crime family.</p>
        <p>In a two-sentence letter, prosecutors also said Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales would not seek the death penalty for four eligible co-defendants, including another reputed acting boss of the crime family.</p>
        <p>The case against Mr. Basciano has grown complex. Last year, he was convicted on racketeering, attempted murder and gambling charges, but the jury did not reach a verdict on murder charges. In that case, he has not been sentenced and faces a new trial on the murder charges.</p>
        <p>In the case involving the death penalty charges, he has been accused in the murder of Randolph Pizzolo, a Bonanno family associate who was found shot to death in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in December 2004.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors say Mr. Basciano was recorded telling a predecessor as leader of the family that he had ordered the murder of Mr. Pizzolo because ''I thought this kid would have been a good wake-up call for everybody.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Basciano has also been charged with soliciting the murder of a prosecutor in the first of the two pending cases.</p>
        <p>Separately, prosecutors have said that Mr. Basciano compiled a hit list including the name of the judge overseeing the present case, Nicholas G. Garaufis of Federal District Court in Brooklyn. Arguing that the list described targets of prayer, not murder, Mr. Basciano asked to take a polygraph test.</p>
        <p>Judge Garaufis, who has declined to recuse himself from the case, allowed the test. Mr. Basciano failed it, prosecutors wrote yesterday in a separate letter to the court.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Mr. Basciano, Ephraim Savitt, said that the government had unfairly selected his client for death penalty prosecution.</p>
        <p>''It seems like the government put together the list and the status within the organization and that equaled the authorization,'' Mr. Savitt said. ''This isn't the type of case that normally would be considered for the death penalty, if you look at the victim.''</p>
        <p>Three death penalty cases have been prosecuted in federal court in Brooklyn in the past year. Two ended in life sentences. In the third, Ronell Wilson was sentenced to die for killing two police detectives.</p>

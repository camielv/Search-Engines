        <p>Five African Union peacekeepers were killed in a brazen rebel ambush in Darfur less than a mile from their base along Sudan's border with Chad on Sunday evening, the African Union said Monday.</p>
        <p>It was the deadliest attack on the beleaguered African Union force since it was deployed to monitor a shaky cease-fire agreement in 2004. The motive for the ambush appeared to be theft -- the rebels took one of the peacekeepers' trucks, though reinforcements killed three of the attackers, African Union officials said.</p>
        <p>At least 15 African Union soldiers have been killed since the peacekeepers were deployed in 2004, and this latest attack will doubtless increase pressure from Rwanda and other major contributors of troops to either strengthen the small, under-equipped force or withdraw.</p>
        <p>The African Union force has been waiting for nearly a year to hand its mandate to or fuse its operations with the United Nations, but Sudan has refused to allow any but African Union peacekeepers in Darfur. With just 7,000 troops to cover an area the size of France, little equipment and a very limited mandate, the African Union force has been derided as ineffective at protecting civilians.</p>
        <p>The attack on Sunday demonstrated that the force also has trouble protecting itself, much less the more than two million displaced people living in camps and hiding in the bush in Darfur.</p>
        <p>Five rebel fighters believed to be allied with the faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army that signed a peace agreement with Sudan's government last May ambushed three truckloads of Senegalese peacekeepers who were on their way to guard a water source three miles from their base in a remote area along the border, Senegalese military and African Union officials said.</p>
        <p>Despite outnumbering their attackers, the Senegalese took heavy casualties. Four men died at the scene and six more were severely wounded. Officers in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur where the African Union force is based, tried to send a helicopter to evacuate the most seriously wounded soldier, but bad weather and the lack of night-vision gear prevented it from taking off. The soldier died before the rescue team arrived Monday morning.</p>
        <p>Another helicopter, carrying the African Union deputy force commander, was hit by bullets on Saturday over rebel territory in the Jebel Marra region but landed safely in El Fasher, African Union officials said.</p>
        <p>The two attacks left the force deeply shaken, said Noureddine Mezni, a spokesman for the force, in a telephone interview from Khartoum.</p>
        <p>''It was unprovoked aggression,'' Mr. Mezni said.</p>
        <p>The attack on Sunday underscored the vulnerability of the small, ill-equipped and demoralized force, he said. ''The situation is very, very tense, and really we are deeply concerned about that increasing state of attack against'' the African Union, he said. ''These are the people who are working hard to help Darfur, and we are targeted by these armed elements.''</p>
        <p>The Peace and Security Council of the African Union is to meet Wednesday to discuss the attacks. Two weeks ago Rwanda, which has a large contingent of well-trained troops who are the backbone of the operation in Darfur, threatened to pull out unless a support package, including air support and new equipment, arrived from the United Nations.</p>
        <p>President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan agreed last November to a buildup for a force that would send 3,000 United Nations, police and civilian personnel with logistical aid to help the African Union force now on the ground. That was to lead to a force of 22,000 peacekeepers from the African Union and the United Nations.</p>
        <p>But after meeting with the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, last week, Mr. Bashir repudiated the proposed force, saying that it would be a ''violation of Sudan's sovereignty and a submission by Sudan to outside custodianship.''</p>
        <p>Senegal has 538 soldiers in Darfur, most of them based on the Chad border. The Senegalese military said in a statement that it did not plan to withdraw them.</p>
        <p>''The Senegalese contingent remains determined to accomplish its mission in Darfur to facilitate the return of definitive peace,'' it said.</p>
        <p>The African Union peacekeeping force was deployed in 2004 to monitor a cease-fire between the rebel groups seeking greater autonomy for Darfur and the Arab-dominated central government, which had used Arab tribal militias to wage a counterinsurgency campaign. A peace agreement reached last May was signed by only one rebel faction, and the violence in Darfur has worsened in many ways.</p>

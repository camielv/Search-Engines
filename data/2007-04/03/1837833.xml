        <p>The following are excerpts of reader responses to Alina Tugend's March 31 Shortcuts column on how busy some people insist on being:</p>
        <p>I feel the same way that you do -- that my friends are frantically filling up their schedules while making me feel odd for reading a book. Even the friends who read for ''pleasure'' typically only read the book for their monthly book group: so that has become an assignment on their calendars, too.  Kevin Adler</p>
        <p>I am an observant Jew. In case you are not aware of it, I thought I'd point out that the Sabbath is a pretty good antidote to a lot of what you mention in your article. Like it or not, for 24 hours, we say good bye to email, internet, phones.....it is liberating. Seems like this might be a helpful practice for all folks, Jewish or not.  Stuart Schnee</p>
        <p>I think it was inspiring for people to see that it is possible to have a lovely life and still read books and see people. That is supposed to be while we are all here, not to look at our blackberries. I really appreciate this reminder.  Kelly L. Close</p>
        <p>I was really annoyed by Alina Tugend's article of March 31 about busy-ness. I have three kids and I do work full-time (for economic reasons), as does my spouse. Nevertheless we can't afford a cleaning person, nor do we have time to exercise regularly (as we did when we didn't have any kids). I have regular but very busy work hours, and then spend the rest of my waking time commuting, preparing meals, doing minimal cleaning of the apartment, doing laundry, paying bills, helping kids with homework, playing with them, etc.</p>
        <p>I end up sleeping about 5 hours a night.  Talvi Laev</p>
        <p>Thank you for translating into words, publicly no less, the thoughts I'm always afraid to express for fear of being labeled ''not busy enough''. I really fail to understand the meaningless lifestyle that most people have adopted in Western society. Unfortunately, it has gone global, for I also see it in Argentina and Spain, two countries I visit often.  Abriela Meilij-Romero</p>
        <p>So right on! After a somewhat forced move into ''pre''-retirement a few years ago, I feel I've done the most important work ever in - and on - my life : Reclaiming my life, my time, my identity (and no longer that of the prestigious organizations I was so proud to represent).  G.K. Knutsson</p>
        <p>''I don't do busy'' is my life motto. When I hear people tell me they're too busy to do this or that, I figure it means, they aren't really interested in doing it and they throw the busy card. It's the socially acceptable way to get out of things that are low priority.  Jennifer Miller</p>
        <p>Ah, the lament of the privileged class....  Mary Golden</p>
        <p>I was a victim of this syndrome and found a solution. 1. no home computer 2. no home fax machine 3. a cell phone that no one in the world has the number to except for my sister and it is never on unless I am calling to say I am lost or late. Life is now a breeze.  Anne E. Nelson</p>
        <p>In the Prologue to the Canterbury Tales, Chaucer (speaking as a pilgrim) makes all of the following observations about The Sergeant-at-Law (i. e. The attorney):</p>
        <p>He is very well-dressed, in brocades, silks, and satins.</p>
        <p>He is very well versed in legal precedent, able to cite case law all the way back to William the Conqueror..</p>
        <p>He is very busy.</p>
        <p>And last, the zinger, cloaked as an arch observation:</p>
        <p>''And yet, he seemed busier than he was.''</p>
        <p>The art of seeming busier than one is is still practiced by well-dressed professionals today, especially by Americans following the advice of Benjamin Franklin to do just that.  Christine Bird</p>

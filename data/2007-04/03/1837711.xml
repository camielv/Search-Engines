        <p>AIR TAXIS ADVANCE -- DayJet, a Florida-based company, took delivery of three Eclipse 500 very light jets on Saturday as it geared up to start air taxi service by the summer. With 239 orders for the $1.5 million jets, DayJet is Eclipse's largest customer. DayJet plans to begin its on-demand service on routes of 300 to 600 miles in Florida, and expand later throughout the Southeast, using regional and community airports rather than major commercial airports. Eclipse, with more than 2,500 orders for its 500 model, is one of more than half a dozen manufacturers making very light jets. About 5,000 of the new planes will be operating within 10 years, the Federal Aviation Administration has said.</p>
        <p>VIRGIN AMERICA, THIS SUMMER? -- Skeptics have scoffed that it could not be done, but Virgin America, a start-up airline spawned by, but separated from, the British carrier Virgin Atlantic, says it is planning to start flying sometime this summer. The airline recently got tentative approval from the Transportation Department to begin operations after successfully establishing that it will be American-owned and operated separately from Virgin Atlantic. It plans to begin operations with flights between San Francisco International and Kennedy International, then expand within nine months to Washington Dulles, Los Angeles International, San Diego and Las Vegas, with a mixture of short-haul and long-haul routes.</p>
        <p>TOKYO HOTEL SKYSCRAPER -- The 248-room Ritz-Carlton, Tokyo opened Friday, occupying the top nine floors of the new 53-story Midtown Tower, at 813 feet the tallest occupied building in the city. (The Tokyo Tower, a monument inspired by the Eiffel Tower, is 1,092 feet high). The hotel is in the Roppongi commercial and residential district. It has what Ritz Carlton calls the city's most expensive Presidential Suite, costing $20,000 a night. More down-to-earth rooms start at $467.</p>
        <p>NEW MIDTOWN TRAVEL CENTER -- American Airlines opened a new Midtown Manhattan travel center at 360 Lexington Avenue near Grand Central Terminal, offering reservations and ticket purchasing and other passenger services. The travel center shares office space with It's Easy, which offers services for expediting the issuing of passports and visas. ''International travel is increasing every year and that means passengers are often in need of help -- sometimes urgent help -- getting their passports and visas in order,'' said David J. Alwadish, the chief executive of It's Easy.</p>
        <p>ET CETERA -- JetBlue Airways began new daily nonstop service last week between Westchester County Airport in White Plains and Orlando, Fla.  It is tax time and United Airlines Mileage Plus Visa is offering double miles to cardholders who use their cards to pay federal income taxes (including quarterly estimated taxes) or state or property taxes through May 25  United Airlines began the first nonstop service between Washington Dulles and Beijing last week.</p>

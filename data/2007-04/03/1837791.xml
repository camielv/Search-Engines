        <p>Frank Wren, an assistant general manager with the Braves, heard Motter announcing a youth league football game in November. Wren turned his video camera to the press box and recorded Motter.</p>
        <p>Wren gave the tape to the Braves' officials in charge of game operations, and Motter was invited to a March 21 audition with 12 other candidates.</p>
        <p>Motter won the job over radio and commercial personalities who also tried out.</p>
        <p>Right after his audition, Motter said that if he was hired, he would probably keep his job as an exterminator and also try to announce some of his boys' baseball and football games.</p>

        <p>By using radio waves and magnetic fields to produce richly detailed images of soft tissue, magnetic resonance imaging can uncover breast abnormalities that cannot be seen with an ordinary mammogram.</p>
        <p>So after reviewing data published in the last few years on the effectiveness of this technology as a screening tool, the American Cancer Society last week issued new guidelines recommending an annual M.R.I. scan starting at age 30 for women at high risk for breast cancer.</p>
        <p>''We have got to change the way we look at these patients and to start treating them differently,'' said Dr. D. David Dershaw, director of breast imaging at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.</p>
        <p>But for many women, the new standards raise difficult questions. For one thing, they apply mainly to the estimated 1.4 million women at high risk of developing breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Many women have no idea which risk category they belong to, researchers note. Several studies have found that women tend to overestimate their chances of breast cancer, and the risk models used by clinicians can produce widely varying results.</p>
        <p>And it is far from certain that there are enough qualified facilities to handle an influx of high-risk women who may now seek regular M.R.I. screenings.</p>
        <p>''From an individual woman's point of view, I think these guidelines are useless,'' said Barbara Brenner, executive director of Breast Cancer Action, an advocacy group in San Francisco. ''We don't have a medical system that can do this. It's just not the real world.''</p>
        <p>Because M.R.I.'s are more sensitive than mammograms or ultrasound, they are more likely to reveal suspicious anomalies that turn out to be benign. Every false positive generates expense, anxiety and treatment that may not be necessary.</p>
        <p>''M.R.I. scans send up a lot of red flags,'' said Dr. Carl D'Orsi, co-chairman of the American College of Radiology's breast imaging commission. ''Unless there's a dramatic change in technology or in the cost of the exam, it won't be appropriate for screening the general public.''</p>
        <p>Along with the troublesome false positives, the scans do pinpoint cancer missed by other methods. After Adrienne Evans of Terlingua, Tex., learned from a biopsy that a lump in her left breast was cancer, she had a mammogram and an ultrasound scan. They revealed no other tumors, so Ms. Evans and her doctor agreed that the best treatment would be a simple procedure to remove the lump.</p>
        <p>Still, because her breast tissue was unusually dense, the doctor ordered an M.R.I. It revealed a second tumor buried deep in the same breast, a menace that had been invisible on the previous scans.</p>
        <p>She opted for an immediate mastectomy, followed by reconstructive breast surgery.</p>
        <p>''I think that M.R.I. saved my life,'' said Ms. Evans, who is 50. ''Without it, my cancer would have gone undetected, and it would have advanced.''</p>
        <p>By recommending M.R.I. screenings only for highest-risk women, the scientists writing the new guidelines hope to raise the odds that what is discovered is actually cancer.</p>
        <p>Women at high risk include those with mutations of the cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, first-degree relatives who have not yet been tested, and those who have undergone radiation therapy to the chest for treatment of conditions like Hodgkin's disease.</p>
        <p>By most estimates, women with strong family histories of breast and ovarian cancer also are at high risk, even if they are not known to have a particular gene mutation.</p>
        <p>For example, a 35-year-old woman whose father's sister contracted breast cancer at 29 and whose grandmother contracted it at 35 has an estimated lifetime risk of 31 percent, according to one risk model. She would qualify for regular M.R.I. screenings under the new guidelines.</p>
        <p>Not all women at increased risk are being advised to get M.R.I. scans. The new guidelines take an equivocal approach to the evaluation of women at only moderate risk of developing breast cancer -- including, surprisingly, those who have survived it. The risk of a second diagnosis is just 10 percent over their lifetimes, not enough to justify regular magnetic resonance screenings.</p>
        <p>And though women found to have such precancerous conditions as lobular carcinoma in situ or atypical ductal hyperplasia are also more likely to develop breast cancer, the increased risk is not sufficient to recommend regular M.R.I. screenings, according to the cancer society.</p>
        <p>Women who have been told repeatedly that early detection is crucial to surviving breast cancer may find this advice confounding. But it stems partly from the limitations of the current health-care system.</p>
        <p>''M.R.I. generates a high number of biopsies for every cancer that you find,'' Dr. Dershaw said. ''If we did screening with M.R.I. for everyone, we would raise the price of screening 10 times over.'' Since that cost may not be reimbursed by insurers or government programs, indiscriminate use of M.R.I. could create a disincentive for screening, compared with less expensive mammography.</p>
        <p>In addition, the quality of scans can vary significantly from clinic to clinic, according to some researchers.</p>
        <p>The best facilities have dedicated breast coils, which are required for the most accurate screening, and they are able to perform the guided biopsies necessary for diagnosis.</p>
        <p>Experienced facilities are uncommon outside metropolitan areas, noted Dr. D'Orsi of the radiology society, so putting the new screening guidelines into effect for high-risk women is likely to prove challenging. Simply reading an M.R.I. scan of the breast is a relatively new skill, as much an art as a science.</p>
        <p>''The real issue is what kind of M.R.I. patients will get and how it will be interpreted,'' Dr. D'Orsi added. ''Now it's like a perfect storm coming together.''</p>

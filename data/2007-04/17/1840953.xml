        <p>The chief executive of US Airways, W. Douglas Parker, received salary and bonuses of $5.4 million last year, chalked up gains of $9 million by exercising stock options and still holds options and other stock holdings that are currently valued at roughly $30 million.</p>
        <p>The pay package, disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, had been widely anticipated by some US Airways workers who are trying to negotiate new contracts for higher pay.</p>
        <p>Across the airline industry, executives are reaping the benefits of a nascent turnaround in fortunes as investors bid up airline stocks; most executive pay is tied to stock price. But workers are still largely lagging under concessionary contracts, and anger is rising.</p>
        <p>The stock price of US Airways has tripled since its 2005 merger with America West Airlines. The shares were quoted at $45.34 in late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parker, 45, received a large package of options and stock grants in the merger; much of the roughly $30 million value is from stock or options that have not yet vested.</p>

        <p>As President Bush and Congress square off over the Iraq war, most Americans agree with Democrats that a timetable should be set to withdraw troops, and they approve measures to link financing with such a timetable, a CBS News poll finds.</p>
        <p>Fifty-seven percent of the respondents said a withdrawal timetable should be set for some time next year, and 38 percent disagreed. One-third said all the troops should be removed now, and 37 percent favored lowering troop levels.</p>
        <p>Almost half, 49 percent, said Congress should have the final say on troop levels, and 44 percent said it should be the president. Eighty-three percent of those surveyed said the administration should take the views of Congress into account when making decisions about Iraq.</p>
        <p>The report was based on telephone interviews conducted last Monday through Thursday with 994 adults nationwide. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>

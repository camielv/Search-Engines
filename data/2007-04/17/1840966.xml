        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Monday announced a new program intended to make it easier for poor people to attend public community colleges while working.</p>

        <p>Moving to alleviate the city's high poverty rates, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday announced a new program intended to make it easier for poor people to attend public community colleges while holding down jobs.</p>
        <p>Under the program, called the Accelerated Study in Associate Programs, students will be able to attend any of the six community colleges of the City University of New York, with all of their classes and tutorials scheduled during the morning, afternoon or evening, whichever track more easily accommodates their work schedules, officials said.</p>
        <p>The program, which is being financed with $6.5 million from the city and will be offered to 1,000 qualified students, was developed as part of Mr. Bloomberg's broader assault on poverty, which he is making a focus of his second term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg said that if the pilot program, scheduled to begin in September, succeeds in increasing the percentage of those who graduate to 75 percent -- he cited statistics showing that the city's community college graduation rates are now roughly 21 percent -- he would make sure it got the money to continue.</p>
        <p>CUNY officials said they were accepting applications for the program, which will operate at Borough of Manhattan, Bronx, Hostos, Kingsborough, La Guardia and Queensborough Community Colleges.</p>
        <p>Aimed at high school students wavering between attending college and entering the work force and at working adults, the program requires that students be prepared for college-level classes. Students will be allowed a deficiency in either reading and writing or math, for which they would need to take a summer course before beginning.</p>
        <p>The program will be offered free to those who qualify, with the cost of books covered by Barnes &amp; Noble, officials said. Income limits will parallel those for federal aid programs like Pell grants.</p>

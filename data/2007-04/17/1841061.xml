        <p>City officials pledged at a City Council hearing yesterday to work with the state, the Signature Theater and the Joyce Theater to produce a feasibility study in eight weeks on cultural development at ground zero. The cultural affairs commissioner, Kate D. Levin, said she hoped to have a better sense of the artistic programming, construction costs and a timetable in the next two months. The Joyce, which presents dance, will be the sole occupant of a performing arts center at the ground zero site; the Signature Theater was supposed to share the center, but is considering a move into nearby Fiterman Hall because sharing seems too complicated.</p>

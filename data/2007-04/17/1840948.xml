        <p>Many advocates had expected that the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999 would transform the politics of gun control.

        <p>Many advocates had expected that the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999 would transform the politics of gun control. In May 2000, the Million Mom March rallied in the nation's capital with a message of ''enough is enough.'' But after the 2000 election, in which Vice President Al Gore's support for new gun regulations was widely thought to have hurt his candidacy, many Democrats showed little appetite for challenging the gun lobby.</p>
        <p>Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said yesterday, ''The politicians are afraid to address this issue.'' In September 2004, gun control advocates lost ground when a federal ban on the sale of 19 types of semiautomatic weapons was allowed to expire after intense lobbying by the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>''I think after today, what we're doing and what we want the American people to do is start asking our elected officials, 'What are we going to do about this?' '' Mr. Helmke said.</p>
        <p>The rifle association said its ''thoughts and prayers are with the families,'' but declined further comment.</p>

        <p>Fashion designers like tall, skinny girls to model their clothes so they can design without worrying about the fit. Composers, meanwhile, write vocal music for a voice type, but with no guarantee the part will fit.</p>
        <p>Composers with a muse, however, can tailor their music to a particular singer. Osvaldo Golijov, the vibrant Argentine composer, frequently collaborates with the soprano Dawn Upshaw, for example on his song cycle ''Ayre'' and his chamber opera ''Ainadamar.'' Last weekend, the two introduced a workshop they supervised under the auspices of Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute and the Bard College Conservatory of Music to encourage collaboration between singers and composers.</p>
        <p>In November, eight emerging composers were paired with young singers to develop new works for voice and instrumental accompaniment. The results of their collaborations were presented on Saturday and Sunday at Weill Recital Hall, conducted by Alan Pierson.</p>
        <p>Clarice Assad, whose ''Confessions'' opened the program Sunday, discovered that the soprano she had been paired with, Emily Albrink, sings both opera and musical theater. So Ms. Assad, a Brazilian, wrote a humorous piece about the insecurities and obsessions of modern women that swings between musical theater and cabaret, with jazzy piano riffs and tango-tinged strings. It was ideal for Ms. Albrink, who delivered a lively, dramatic performance.</p>
        <p>''Confessions'' was the first of four visceral works, not surprising from a workshop supervised by Mr. Golijov, who writes in an emotive, melodic and eclectic idiom and for whom the theatrical elements of music are vital.</p>
        <p>Ryan Carter's imaginative ''Doot,'' which he pronounced as a high-pitched beep, was certainly theatrical. Scored for 10 instruments, including piccolo, trumpet, percussion and strings, it sounded at times like, say, a Martian dance party, which had Maghan Stewart, a soprano, and Julie Anne Miller, a mezzo, singing in a melodic alien language.</p>
        <p>The moody, spare-textured ''Sun, Moon and Star'' by Angel Lam, a Hong Kong-born composer, was about her childhood friendships and was well suited to the clear, expressive voices of Chanel Wood and Yulia van Doren.</p>
        <p>The program concluded with David Bruce's lively, intense ''Piosenki,'' set to the verses of the Polish poet Julian Tuwim. The instrumental music sometimes sounded like an Eastern European wedding band, over which the earthy soprano of Melissa Wegner and the baritone of Yang Yang (singing in Polish) conveyed, with flair, the whimsy and humor of Tuwim's texts.</p>

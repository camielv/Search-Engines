        <p>Re ''McCain Sees 'No Plan B' for Iraq War; Says Troop Buildup Is the Only U.S. Option'' (''If Elected '' series, front page, April 15):</p>
        <p>What a terrible combination -- a party with no competence at finishing a war, and a party's candidate who claims there is no alternative but to continue it. Endless, incompetently run war, with no accountability, just blindly believe the ''leader.''</p>

        <p>Re ''McCain Sees 'No Plan B' for Iraq War; Says Troop Buildup Is the Only U.S. Option'' (''If Elected '' series, front page, April 15):</p>
        <p>What a terrible combination -- a party with no competence at finishing a war, and a party's candidate who claims there is no alternative but to continue it. Endless, incompetently run war, with no accountability, just blindly believe the ''leader.''</p>
        <p>There's always a ''Plan B'' for a leader. And before you enter a conflict, you must always be prepared to accept the consequences of failure. Otherwise, you're irresponsible -- as a party or a leader. No spin can erase it -- only prolong the agony.</p>
        <p>William Jolitz  Los Gatos, Calif., April 15, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain's admission that a troop buildup is the only strategy he can envision in Iraq ought to doom his presidential run, but leaves open a serious question: how many other candidates harbor this same catastrophic view?</p>
        <p>Long before the invasion of Iraq, most thinking Americans determined that it was a no-win cause, and it is hair-raising to think that four years of increasing defeat there has not changed the mind of the die-hards.</p>
        <p>America is desperate now for a leader who does not see things only in black-or-white hues, but knows how to design new strategies and strike compromises about old ones. My informal survey of the current crop of candidates shows a serious lack there.</p>
        <p>Stephen E. Phillips  Brooklyn, April 15, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>One of the many troubling aspects of the arguments against disengaging in Iraq is the assertion that ''if we leave, we lose.'' The problem with this argument is that the ''insurgents'' are apparently primarily interested in getting us out of the way so they can get down to the serious business of killing one another.</p>
        <p>The United States isn't even a party to this vendetta, so it's hard to see how we can ''lose.''</p>
        <p>Robert A. Myers  New York, April 15, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We have been told that if we withdraw from Iraq now, violence there will increase and the entire region will destabilize. That may well be true, but it would also be true in one, five or 10 more years.</p>
        <p>We cannot maintain an artificial level of violence in Iraq indefinitely. We cannot stabilize the entire region, which is embroiled in religious, ethnic and national strife. It can't be done, and the cost of trying is far too high for our own country.</p>
        <p>Recognizing this is not defeatism; it is sanity. The only solution is to withdraw outside forces and influences and let Iraq and the Middle East find their own levels.</p>
        <p>Adele E. Zimmermann  Embudo, N.M., April 15, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Why not give the president what he wants -- a blank check to finance the troops. Oh, by the way, let's do it on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
        <p>No big fuss, just adjust the tax rates up to pay for the troops and their activities.</p>
        <p>Then let's see who wants to support the troops! That will bring the cost of the war into everyone's sight!</p>
        <p>Dick Orenstein  Sarasota, Fla., April 15, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It might be helpful, in dealing with our situation in Iraq, to dispense with words like ''winning,'' ''losing,'' ''victory'' or ''defeat.'' The language of divorce might be more constructive: ''compromise,'' ''settlement,'' ''supervised visiting rights.''</p>
        <p>Even in beleaguered enterprises like the theater, we try to avoid the reductive categories of ''hit'' or ''flop.'' We have our ''limited runs,'' ''flawed efforts'' and ''brave attempts'' that make room for different works to take their place.</p>
        <p>A. R. Gurney  Roxbury, Conn., April 15, 2007</p>

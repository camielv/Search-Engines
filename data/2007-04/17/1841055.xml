        <p>Gov. Eliot Spitzer called on Raoul Felder yesterday to step down as the chairman of a state commission that oversees state and local judges in the wake of a vote of no confidence by the other commissioners last week. Mr. Felder, left, a celebrity divorce lawyer appointed by George E. Pataki, is the chairman of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct. The other nine members of the commission cast their vote against him last week because they said a new book Mr. Felder wrote with the comedian Jackie Mason ''repeatedly invokes racial, ethnic and religious invective.'' Mr. Felder has disputed the characterization of the book and said he would fight any move to oust him before his term ends next March.</p>

        <p>Britain's biggest journalists union, the 40,000-member National Union of Journalists, has voted in favor of a boycott of Israeli goods, citing what it called Israel's ''military adventures.'' The measure, approved by a vote of 66 to 54 at the union's annual delegates meeting on Friday, called for ''a boycott of Israeli goods similar to those boycotts in the struggles against apartheid in South Africa.'' The timing was particularly delicate because a BBC journalist, Alan Johnston, has been held for over a month in Gaza. A Palestinian group claimed on Sunday to have killed Mr. Johnston, but the BBC said it was treating the report as a rumor. The union's Web site says that the delegates criticized Palestinian authorities for failing ''to carry out their promises to do all they can to free Alan.'' Last year, the largest British university teachers' association voted to encourage individual academics in Britain to sever professional contact with their counterparts in Israel.</p>

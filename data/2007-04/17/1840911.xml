        <p>9 P.M. (Sundance Channel) BIG IDEAS FOR A SMALL PLANET -- The centerpiece of ''The Green,'' a weekly television and online (sundancechannel.com/thegreen) programming block dedicated to environmental awareness, this 13-part documentary series interviews designers who have come up with green options for everyday living. First: Colette Brooks, above, who connects consumers with biodiesel cars and fuel; Joel Woolf, who devised a two-tank engine system that runs on vegetable oil; and Jeff Simmons, a professional race car driver and ethanol advocate who shows off that fuel's potential with a 220-mile-per-hour test run in preparation for the IndyCar Series.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- One more down, with Sanjaya still to go. Tonight Martina McBride, the Kansas girl turned country superstar, helps the seven remaining contestants master a twang and the two-step before she performs her latest hit, ''Anyway,'' on tomorrow's results show.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (13, 49) FIRST FLOWER -- A rose is a rose is a  or is it? ''Nova'' examines Archaefructus, a 124-million-year-old fossil discovered in a remote mountain region of China that some scientists believe to be the earliest evidence of a flowering plant -- and that could hold the key to the origin of flowers, which Charles Darwin called ''an abominable mystery.''</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) HOUSE -- When things between Cameron and Chase (Jennifer Morrison and Jesse Spencer, right) become tense, House intentionally assigns them tasks to do together, like investigating the home of a 6-year-old girl who has a condition usually found in much older patients.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) DANCING WITH THE STARS -- In this results show, one couple rumbas itself right out of the competition.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13, 49) GANGS OF IRAQ -- ''America at a Crossroads,'' the series of 11 documentaries that examines the challenges confronting the world in the aftermath of Sept. 11, continues with ''Gangs of Iraq,'' a look at failed efforts to build up Iraqi forces, and, at 10, ''The Case for War: In Defense of Freedom,'' which follows Richard Perle, a former assistant secretary of defense, as he travels the world debating the merits of an assertive United States foreign policy.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (CNN) LARRY KING LIVE -- On the 50th anniversary of his first broadcast, Larry King opens up to Katie Couric.</p>
        <p>10:30 P.M. (MTV) LIVING LAHAINA -- These guys are your ticket to ride, especially if you're a beach bunny with a yearning to dip your polished toes in Maui's spectacular surf. This new reality series hangs with some local lords of the board as Kimo Kinimaka, the owner of the Royal Hawaiian Surf Academy and their boss, tries to keep their eyes on the waves instead of the babes.</p>
        <p>11:35 P.M. (CBS) LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN -- The talk show host Craig Ferguson and Dave Della Terza, the creator of votefortheworst.com -- which is campaigning to keep Sanjaya Malakar in the running on ''American Idol'' -- shoot the breeze with Mr. Letterman. Avril Lavigne performs from her new album, ''The Best Damn Thing.''</p>

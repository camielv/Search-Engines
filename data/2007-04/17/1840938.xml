        <p>A state court judge in Texas dismissed a libel case yesterday filed against The New York Times in response to a series of articles on worker safety at McWane Inc., an Alabama company.</p>
        <p>The judge, Jerry Calhoon, signed an order granting The Times's motion for summary judgment after a three-hour hearing in Tyler, Tex., without providing a written opinion, leaving it unclear which argument made by lawyers for The Times proved persuasive.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit was brought by Mike Adams and the company he owns, Occu-Safe Inc., which provided medical services at McWane's pipe manufacturing plant in Tyler. Mr. Adams asserted that the articles included false statements about the quality of care provided to McWane employees.</p>
        <p>The articles, which were accompanied by a television documentary that was broadcast on the PBS program ''Frontline,'' described environmental and safety violations at the plant and included accusations by employees about their medical treatment. The series, along with a companion series about the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, won the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 2004.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs could not be reached for comment last night.</p>
        <p>David E. McCraw, vice president and assistant general counsel at The Times, said he expected the plaintiffs to appeal the decision. But, Mr. McCraw said, ''we're confident that the legal arguments that carried the day with the trial court will be sustained on appeal.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for The Times argued that the series of articles could not be defamatory because it described conditions and events at the plant truthfully. The newspaper also argued that it accurately conveyed accusations of employees critical of the Tyler plant, entitling the newspaper to summary judgment under Texas law.</p>

        <p>Last weekend's state and local elections in Nigeria were a demonstration of how not to hold a democratic election.

        <p>Last weekend's state and local elections in Nigeria were a demonstration of how not to hold a democratic election. Ballot boxes were stuffed, some polling places opened only hours before they were scheduled to close, and in some communities no voting took place at all because of a lack of supplies and rampant intimidation.</p>
        <p>With presidential elections scheduled for this Saturday, President Olusegun Obasanjo and Nigeria's election commission must move quickly and persuasively to ensure that there is no repeat of last weekend's chaos.</p>
        <p>A last-minute ruling yesterday by Nigeria's Supreme Court ordered the election commission to restore a leading opposition candidate to the ballot, a step that could help get this election back on course. The commission must now carry out the court's order, making sure that the name and the picture of the reinstated candidate, Vice President Atiku Abubakar, appears on every ballot. It needs to act quickly so the next president can take office after Mr. Obasanjo's term expires on May 29.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abubakar, once an Obasanjo ally but now a critic, was removed from the ballot by the national election commission on corruption charges. The court ruled that the commission had no authority to disqualify candidates. Corruption is a severe problem in Nigeria. But the anticorruption commission appointed by Mr. Obasanjo has shown a particular zeal for going after his political opponents.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court also ruled that several candidates for state office had been kept off the ballot illegally. Some state races will now need to be held again. That must be done quickly so newly elected governors will be able to take over when the terms of the current officeholders expire next month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo took office eight years ago as an internationally admired democrat. His challenge now is to rescue these elections and pass democracy's torch to a fairly chosen successor next month.</p>

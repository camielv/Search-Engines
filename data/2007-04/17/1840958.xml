        <p>Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, visiting the Middle East, will urge leaders to back Iraq's government and to put aside their doubts about Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's ability to curtail sectarian violence, a senior Defense Department official traveling with Mr. Gates said on the plane trip here.</p>
        <p>Arriving here on Monday, Mr. Gates was planning to hold talks with King Abdullah II on Tuesday on ways that Jordan could contribute to American efforts to stabilize neighboring Iraq.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates is on his third visit to the region since taking office in December.</p>
        <p>Winning greater backing for Mr. Maliki's Shiite-dominated government from the Sunni governments of the Middle East has become a major emphasis for the Bush administration since it embarked on a new political and military strategy in Iraq earlier this year.</p>
        <p>''Jordan has always been a strong ally of the United States, and I look forward to discussing with the king how we can contribute to his efforts and how he can contribute to ours,'' Mr. Gates told reporters traveling with him. He said Jordan was already providing medical assistance and training help for Iraq.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Maliki faces skepticism from Sunni Arab countries over his government's close ties with the Shiite government in Iran, as well as doubts about whether his government can bring stability to the country, said a senior American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was speaking before the discussions took place.</p>
        <p>American officials are hopeful that by persuading other Arab governments to work closely with Mr. Maliki, they can reduce the hostility for the Iraqi government from Sunnis inside Iraq.</p>
        <p>''What we need is for the regional players, like Jordan, and established players in the region, like Egypt, these broadly-based Sunni countries, to show that it recognizes the Maliki government,'' the senior official said.</p>
        <p>Relations between Iraq and other largely Sunni members of the Arab League have been cool since Mr. Maliki took office last year. At a regional conference in Baghdad last month, Mr. Maliki appealed for help from his neighbors to stem the violence in Iraq.</p>
        <p>But only a few days later, speaking in Cairo, the Arab League secretary general, Amr Moussa, said that the Iraqi government was responsible for defusing the sectarian violence, and that Iraq should revise its Constitution and rescind laws that give preferential treatment to Shiites and Kurds.</p>
        <p>''I think there is skepticism that the Maliki government is as strong a government as would be needed,'' the senior American official said. ''I think any government in Maliki's situation would be subject to these doubts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates is also expected to focus heavily in his talks with governments in the region on building support for the administration's policy of isolating Iran, the senior official said. After Jordan, Mr. Gates plans to go to Egypt for talks with President Hosni Mubarak, and to Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates will seek to reassure Israel that planned American arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states will not threaten the Israeli military superiority in the region, the senior official said. The administration is considering an increase in military aid to Israel to offset the possible sales of sophisticated missile defense systems, naval ships and precision guided munitions to Arab countries, administration officials said.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''He's Not My Grandpa. He's My Dad'' (Thursday Styles, April 12): My husband is 17 years my senior. We married when I was 20 and he was 37. Our first child was born one year later. When our sixth child was born, my husband was 56.</p>
        <p>He was a great Lamaze coach, and while I breast-fed, he still got up first, changed the baby and brought the baby to me. We are now the grandparents of 14.</p>

        <p>My only concern has always been the number of years we will have together.</p>
        <p>Now I realize, eternity wouldn't be long enough.</p>

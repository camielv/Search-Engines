        <p>A government witness testified in Federal District Court yesterday that the man charged with the 1992 killing of Thomas and Rose Marie Uva of Queens, a young couple who robbed Mafia social clubs, had previously said he planned to take revenge. The witness, Michael DiLeonardo, a Gambino captain, testified that the defendant, Dominick Pizzonia, made the statement to John A. Gotti outside a social club where patrons had been robbed. ''He told John he was going to go after them,'' Mr. DiLeonardo said. ''He was going to kill them.''</p>

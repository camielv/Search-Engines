        <p>Heard the one about how taking a lot of vitamin B3 can help you pass a drug test, even if you have been using marijuana or cocaine?</p>
        <p>It doesn't. But it might send you to the emergency room.</p>
        <p>The Annals of Emergency Medicine reports  in its online edition on several cases in which patients arrived at a hospital suffering ill effects from the vitamin, also known as niacin. The lead author is Dr. Manoj K. Mittal of the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>The recommended daily intake of niacin is 14 to 16 milligrams, although doctors prescribe it for some medical conditions in dosages up to 5 grams a day. At those levels, it commonly causes side effects, including skin and liver problems.</p>
        <p>The study details visits by two patients who suffered life-threatening problems.</p>
        <p>One, a 14-year-old boy, went to the emergency room after suffering vomiting, upper abdominal pain and dizziness. He told doctors that he smoked marijuana and that he had taken 11 500-milligram niacin tablets over a 36-hour period.</p>
        <p>The other patient, a 17-year-old girl, also suffered from vomiting and dizziness and was unresponsive for several minutes before emergency services were called. She said she had taken five 500-milligram tablets over two days.</p>
        <p>The authors said emergency room doctors needed to be aware of the practice.</p>

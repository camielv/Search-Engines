        <p>It's all about karma.</p>
        <p>And you have to have some good karma when you travel like I do. I'm on the road about 300 days a year throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. I've seen my share of irate passengers on flights and in the airport. Usually, I just try and ignore them as I listen to tunes on my iPod. But sometimes you have to take a stand. If you do, the fates may actually smile on you.</p>

        <p>It's all about karma.</p>
        <p>And you have to have some good karma when you travel like I do. I'm on the road about 300 days a year throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. I've seen my share of irate passengers on flights and in the airport. Usually, I just try and ignore them as I listen to tunes on my iPod. But sometimes you have to take a stand. If you do, the fates may actually smile on you.</p>
        <p>On a recent flight to Canada out of New York, we found out at the gate that the Montreal airport was closed due to heavy fog. Everyone on the flight had to go back into line and then reschedule. The agent was trying to be accommodating, but there were no flights available until the next day.</p>
        <p>This guy in front of me was very tall, very imposing and, unfortunately, very angry. He refused to believe the airport was closed and he demanded that he be flown to Montreal by any means. The agent was incredibly composed as she tried to convince this screaming passenger that she could do nothing to help him. This went on for a good 20 minutes. Everyone in line was looking at each other and becoming increasingly uncomfortable. The agent finally told him that the fog was ''an act of God.'' He then turned to all of us in line and screamed, ''I don't believe in God.''</p>
        <p>I'm not religious at all. But I believe in karma and humor, so I figured I had to do something to defuse the situation. So I said loud enough for everyone in line to hear, ''Dude, you may not believe in God, but you better start believing in the weather.''</p>
        <p>The next thing I know people are applauding and slapping me on the back. So I thought all that good will would result in something good happening to me. And it did.</p>
        <p>The airline put us up in the Crowne Plaza. On the bus to the hotel, I met a woman whom I had dinner and drinks with. We were discussing our businesses. Through her I met a client who awarded our company a $1 million project. And the client and I still have an ongoing relationship.</p>
        <p>If it weren't for the fog, a canceled flight and a bus trip to a hotel, I never would have gotten this business. That's karma.</p>
        <p>Another time, I was flying to Marseille for a speaking engagement. There were incredible problems trying to get out of Paris. It was a nightmare, and I was late for the event. The airline personnel were trying really hard to help us out. And I tried to be extra nice, extra polite, because they were obviously stressed.</p>
        <p>I'm usually a cheap-seat kind of guy. But on my return flight from Paris to New York, I was ushered into first class.</p>
        <p>I didn't expect anything, but they remembered me. I've never flown first class, and I have to say, it was an absolutely incredible gastronomical delight.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the universe can reward you with new clients. Other times, it's good food and good wine. As far as airline karma goes, I'm in nirvana.</p>

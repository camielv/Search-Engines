        <p>ABC posted a considerable lead in the ratings Sunday, significantly overshadowing Fox's two-hour premiere of ''Drive'' and winning every hour of the night in the important demographic of adults 18 to 49. According to Nielsen's estimates, ABC's ''Desperate Housewives'' garnered the night's highest ratings, earning 16.1 million viewers at 9 p.m. It followed new episodes of ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' at 7 (8.6 million) and ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' at 8 (10.2 million). During the 10 p.m. hour, ABC's ''Brothers &amp; Sisters'' (11.5 million) remained on top among adults 18 to 49, but CBS's ''Without a Trace'' led the hour in total viewers (14.3 million). For the night, CBS actually had slightly more total viewers over all, despite ABC's advantage in the 18-to-49 demographic. Meanwhile, ''Drive'' drew just 6 million viewers from 8 to 10. Fox ranked third for the night in the 18-to-49 demographic, ahead of NBC.</p>

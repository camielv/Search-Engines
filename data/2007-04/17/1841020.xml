        <p>Re ''Romantic Revulsion in the New Century: Flaw-O-Matic 2.0'' (Findings, April 10): The empirical basis for John Tierney's article presupposes that individuals who are ''permanently'' single have some flaw.</p>
        <p>Actually, an alternative theory might be that these individuals are either genetically or environmentally predisposed to being single, and the observations based on speed dating or personal ads may be an attempt to conform to societal mores and not mere narcissism (pickiness).</p>
        <p>The majority of people may still be looking for a partner, but those who remain single are not flawed. To present this lifestyle as somehow curable is to label many normally functioning and happy individuals as misanthropic.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was aghast to learn that to land a date, a man of my height would require an annual income that exceeds his competitors' by $277,000. How fortunate that my peers are endowed with more than enough wit, charm and ingenuity to compensate for the mastodon-hunting skills of our taller rivals.</p>

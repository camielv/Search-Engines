        <p>The Macao bank that was a stumbling block to international efforts to dismantle the North Korean nuclear weapons program challenged on Monday a United States Treasury Department ruling that bars the bank from access to the American financial system.</p>
        <p>Banco Delta Asia, a family-owned bank that the United States has accused of committing financial crimes on behalf of North Korea, said in a statement that the March 14 ruling was ''politically motivated'' because it was based on disputes between the United States and North Korea.</p>
        <p>In its filing with the Treasury Department, the bank also called for the decision to be revoked on the grounds that it was made without supporting evidence, ignored remedial measures the bank had taken and denied the bank the opportunity to respond to fresh accusations, the statement said.</p>
        <p>''In this filing, the bank seeks a fair hearing on all the evidence, free from political intervention and the distraction of public diplomacy,'' Joseph McLaughlin, a lawyer for Banco Delta Asia in New York, said in the statement. ''We are confident that the U.S. legal system, in the end, will not countenance the sacrifice of legal rights to political ends.''</p>
        <p>Banco Delta Asia, and its owner, Stanley Au, a prominent Macao businessman and an adviser to the Chinese government, have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>A Treasury Department spokeswoman, Molly Millerwise, said the department had confidence in the merits of its action against Banco Delta Asia.</p>
        <p>The bank was drawn into the complex diplomacy surrounding the North Korean nuclear weapons program when the Treasury Department, in September 2005, accused it of acting as a ''willing pawn'' for North Korea in a range of illicit activities, including money laundering and distributing counterfeit American currency.</p>
        <p>After an 18-month investigation, the Treasury Department ruled March 14 that under the Patriot Act, American financial institutions would be barred from doing business with Banco Delta Asia.</p>
        <p>The Treasury Department's accusations in September 2005 clearly angered North Korea, which subsequently boycotted the six-nation talks about its nuclear program for more than a year.</p>
        <p>North Korea returned to the talks late last year and agreed on Feb. 13 to shut down its main plutonium producing reactor within 60 days in return for energy aid. It has not done so.</p>

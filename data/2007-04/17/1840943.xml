      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Nigeria's highest court ruled Monday that electoral officials had illegally excluded a top opposition candidate for president, Atiku Abubakar, from the ballot for the presidential election on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The ruling, a firm rebuke of President Olusegun Obasanjo's efforts to prevent politicians he says are corrupt from running for office, throws the already chaotic election season in Africa's most populous nation and largest oil producer into deeper turmoil.</p>
        <p>The unanimous decision also applies to candidates for governor who were barred from races for suspected corruption in half a dozen states. Those state elections took place last Saturday, amid widespread allegations of fraud and intimidation. The ruling raised fresh doubts about whether the results would stand.</p>
        <p>In the eight years since Nigeria emerged from military rule, the elections have presented the most serious test of the nation's young democracy, analysts said. The president has had a contentious relationship with the courts in the past, and it is unclear whether the government will comply with the ruling.</p>
        <p>''Democracy is the only credible option for this country,'' said Nnamdi K. Obasi, a Nigeria analyst with the International Crisis Group, an organization that seeks to reduce violent conflict, adding that the stability of the region was at stake in the election. ''They have to make this work.''</p>
        <p>Electoral officials canceled the vote tallies in two states this week as a result of violence and technical problems that kept large numbers of voters from the polls, and opposition parties were preparing legal challenges in several other states.</p>
        <p>From the results available Monday, the governing People's Democratic Party was on its way to winning a large majority of the country's 36 governorships in a series of landslides that opposition parties called improbable given the deep divisions within the party and the electorate. But P.D.P. officials said their electoral success reflected satisfaction with the president's policies.</p>
        <p>Lai Mohammed, a spokesman for the Action Congress, Mr. Abubakar's party, hailed the court ruling as a victory for democracy in a country that has spent much of its history under authoritarian rule. ''We have been vindicated, and we will be victorious at the polls,'' Mr. Mohammed said. ''The rule of law has been upheld.''</p>
        <p>The looming presidential election has focused international attention on Nigeria, as it may result in the first transfer of power from one democratically elected leader to another since the nation won its independence from Britain in 1960. Still, it was unclear Monday whether the presidential election would go ahead as scheduled.</p>
        <p>Some 61 million people are registered to vote, and color ballots with the pictures of the 24 presidential candidates have already been printed and distributed across 36 states. Mr. Abubakar had been left off millions of the ballots, and it remained unclear how his name could be added before the election. However, the electoral commission said it had made unspecified provisions in case Mr. Abubakar was reinstated as a candidate, and the Independent National Electoral Commission was meeting behind closed doors on Monday to decide how to proceed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abubakar is the sitting vice president and was once a close ally of Mr. Obasanjo. A wealthy former chief of the country's customs office, Mr. Abubakar was a founding member of the governing party, but he broke with Mr. Obasanjo after the president's allies tried to change the Constitution and allow Mr. Obasanjo to run for a third term.</p>
        <p>That effort ran afoul of the unwritten rules of Nigerian politics -- intended to keep the peace in a fractious nation evenly divided between Christians and Muslims -- that dictated that Nigeria's next president be a Muslim from the north, like Mr. Abubakar. Mr. Obasanjo is a Yoruba Christian from the southwest.</p>
        <p>The already tense relationship between the men grew into a nasty public feud. They traded accusations of corruption, with Mr. Obasanjo asserting that Mr. Abubakar had raided a public education fund, and Mr. Abubakar accusing the president of enriching himself and his friends with oil money.</p>
        <p>After being barred from seeking the P.D.P. nomination for president, Mr. Abubakar accepted the nomination of the Action Congress, a newly formed opposition party made up of a coalition of smaller parties and disaffected members of the P.D.P.</p>
        <p>The P.D.P. chose Umaru Yar'Adua, a northern governor from a prominent political family, as its candidate. A former military ruler, Muhammadu Buhari, also a northern Muslim, is a leading candidate, representing the All Nigeria People's Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abubakar had been among the most popular contenders for the presidency, but last month the electoral commission barred him and several other candidates from running for office because they were on a list of politicians deemed too corrupt by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, a federal body created by Mr. Obasanjo to fight corruption.</p>
        <p>The anticorruption commission has been commended for prosecuting some high-level officials, like a former head of the national police force accused of stealing millions in public money, and the governor of an oil-rich state in the Niger Delta who spent lavishly on residences and cars while leaving the population impoverished.</p>
        <p>But critics of Mr. Obasanjo have accused him of using the commission to go after his political enemies, a charge seemingly bolstered by the fact that many of those barred from running were from opposition parties or factions of the governing party hostile to the president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasi, of the International Crisis Group, said the state elections were ''barely, barely credible,'' and that significant improvements in organization and security were needed for the presidential election to have any legitimacy.</p>
        <p>The European Union's election observer mission said it had serious concerns about the state elections, urging that in some states election officials should ''undertake a comprehensive investigation and give serious consideration to re-running the process.'' A coalition of Nigerian community organizations said that in 10 states the results were so flawed that they ''cannot be said to have reflected the will of the people,'' Reuters reported.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo, a former general, was elected in 1999 after three decades of on-again-off-again authoritarian rule and has presided over the longest stretch of civilian rule in the country's history. He has won praise for his handling of the country's economy, which has grown at a steady rate during his tenure, and for paying off Nigeria's more than $30 billion in foreign debt.</p>

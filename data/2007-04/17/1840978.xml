        <p>Re ''Loosening the Stem Cell Binds'' (editorial, April 13):</p>
        <p>I find it hypocritical that President Bush, citing respect for life, has such a moral objection to the use of human embryos (five-day-old blastocysts, or microscopic balls of cells) for scientific and medical research when he had no problem starting and supporting a war that has caused the deaths of thousands and did not voice any objection to the death penalty when 131 prisoners were executed while he was governor of Texas.</p>

        <p>Re ''Loosening the Stem Cell Binds'' (editorial, April 13):</p>

        <p>I guess that in Mr. Bush's ideological world, protecting laboratory-created cells is far more important than preserving the lives of the people who might be treated for diseases, disorders and trauma as a result of embryonic stem cell research.</p>

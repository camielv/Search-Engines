        <p>ARGAMASO--Ravelo M.D., 81. The President and Board of Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center are deeply saddened by the passing of Ravelo Argamaso M.D., an esteemed colleague for over 40 years and a founder of Montefiores Center for Craniofacial Surgery. Dr. Argamaso served as professor and attending surgeon in both the departments of Plastic Surgery and Neurosurgery and was the department of Plastic Surgery's first resident in 1959. Dr. Argamaso was known as a mentor to the many residents who passed through the surgery program over the many years he was at Montefiore. He specialized in pediatric congenital disorders, writing extensively on cleft lip and palate surgery. Our heart felt condolences go out to his wife Carol, his daughters Charlene, Susanne and Stephanie and their families. Spencer Foreman, M.D., President David A. Tanner, Chairman Board of Trustees Montefiore Medical Center</p>

        <p>New York Spends the Most On Detoxification Patients  New York State spends far more than other states on drug and alcohol treatment, including more than $300 million a year on 30,000 detoxification patients. One reason is that $50 million is spent on the 500 most expensive patients, who check in and out of detox wards more than a dozen times a year.</p>

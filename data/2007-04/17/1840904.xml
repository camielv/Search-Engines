        <p>Amanda Loulaki and her trio of dancers appear to be well into the aftershock stage when the lights rise on ''Delirium, or that taste in my mouth,'' which had its premiere on Thursday at Danspace Project. Torsos shudder and clench, legs splay; it's as if some great upset has occurred, and their bodies are only now registering its effects.</p>
        <p>This place is all too familiar to any half-sentient adult: psychological hurts acquire a physical dimension, and the stunned body curls into itself, creating a strange distance from the mind. It's a rich state for dance to evoke but a difficult one to sustain, even in a 55-minute show. ''Delirium'' is only partly successful in maintaining the wounded erotic tension it builds in the opening section, but its fiercest moments grab the jugular and squeeze.</p>

        <p>Amanda Loulaki and her trio of dancers appear to be well into the aftershock stage when the lights rise on ''Delirium, or that taste in my mouth,'' which had its premiere on Thursday at Danspace Project. Torsos shudder and clench, legs splay; it's as if some great upset has occurred, and their bodies are only now registering its effects.</p>
        <p>This place is all too familiar to any half-sentient adult: psychological hurts acquire a physical dimension, and the stunned body curls into itself, creating a strange distance from the mind. It's a rich state for dance to evoke but a difficult one to sustain, even in a 55-minute show. ''Delirium'' is only partly successful in maintaining the wounded erotic tension it builds in the opening section, but its fiercest moments grab the jugular and squeeze.</p>
        <p>Joanna Seitz's visual design of potted plants, floor tiles and a hanging cloth gives a vague sense of domesticity. There's no narrative here, only human wreckage; these could be your neighbors, flailing about on the floor. They could be you.</p>
        <p>But chances are that your misery doesn't look so poetic. When Rebecca Serrell jumps from side to side, almost skipping, and Pedro Osorio watches, nodding and eating an orange, questions of power and control seethe. There's anguish here, and the acrid tang of sex. And how to decipher the complex play of muscles in the commanding Carolyn Hall's rigid, naked back? (Naoko Nagata's ragged, revealing costumes show just the right amount of flesh.) It's as clear as it is mysterious.</p>
        <p>But then there's the text, spoken sporadically throughout. Is it possible that Ms. Loulaki doesn't trust the body to get the job done? Why else ladle on heavy-handed drivel like, ''What is this monster inside me?'' or ''Please don't come any closer, I don't know what to do with you''?</p>
        <p>The best movement creations in ''Delirium'' don't need any linguistic accompaniment (better to stick with George Kontos's moody sound design). But if Ms. Loulaki insists, she should come up with something more in keeping with the enigmatic language of her choreography.</p>

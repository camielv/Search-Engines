        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Turkey and the U.N.'s Cover-Up'' (editorial, April 13) reflects only the Armenian version of the events of 1915.</p>
        <p>There is no explanation as to how and why these sad events took place in eastern Anatolia. There is also no reference to those Turks who were mass-murdered by Armenian bands during that time. Those tragic events took place in time of war, and both populations suffered extensively.</p>
        <p>As such, describing these events as ''genocide'' is unacceptable. Indeed, if it had been a ''genocide,'' how was it possible for the Armenians living in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to survive? In fact, there is still a large Armenian Turkish minority in Istanbul that enriches our cultural diversity.</p>
        <p>If the Armenian authorities are certain of their accusations, then they should be able to accept Turkey's proposal to set up a joint historians' commission, including those from third countries, to examine all the available documents and to reach a public decision on what really happened.</p>
        <p>Turkey has nothing to cover up. We are ready and willing to face the history. We expect the same from the Armenian side.</p>
        <p>Baki Ilkin  Permanent Representative  Turkish Mission to the U.N.  New York, April 13, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Armenian community commends you for properly characterizing the Armenian genocide and portraying with clarity the lengths Turkey will go to just to prevent discussion of this fact of world history.</p>
        <p>It is not enough that Turkey, an aspirant to the European Union, prosecutes its citizens for discussing the crimes and threatens to retaliate against countries that acknowledge the Armenian genocide. It has shown the world that honoring the memory of the 800,000 murdered Rwandans is much less important than imposing its revisionism at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>As you point out, the resulting embarrassment seems not to faze Ankara. It is too busy figuring out new ways to sweep history under the rug.</p>
        <p>Bryan Ardouny  Executive Director  Armenian Assembly of America  Washington, April 13, 2007</p>

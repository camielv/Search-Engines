        <p>More than a dozen prospective jurors were questioned Monday as jury selection began in the trial of Jose Padilla and two co-defendants accused of providing material support to terrorists.</p>
        <p>Judge Marcia G. Cooke of Federal District Court ruled that prosecutors could make reference to the Sept. 11 attacks.

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>More than a dozen prospective jurors were questioned Monday as jury selection began in the trial of Jose Padilla and two co-defendants accused of providing material support to terrorists.</p>
        <p>Judge Marcia G. Cooke of Federal District Court ruled that prosecutors could make reference to the Sept. 11 attacks. But Judge Cooke said they would not be allowed to suggest that Mr. Padilla, a Brooklyn-born American who was declared an enemy combatant by President Bush in 2002, and his co-defendants had been involved in the attacks.</p>
        <p>''Any idea, through inference or otherwise, that these defendants are connected to 9/11 is not available to the government in this case,'' she said. ''Anything connected to it evokes such negativity that, if it's not what this case is about, should not be brought into this case.''</p>
        <p>Selecting 12 jurors and six alternates is expected to take about two weeks. The trial could last until September. Some of the prospective jurors questioned Monday expressed knowledge of the case or recognized Mr. Padilla's name. One panelist who said he felt biased against Muslims or Arabs was excused from the jury pool of more than 300.</p>
        <p>''It would provide some difficulty for me to be open-minded when the subject is one of terror,'' the man said. ''On the basis of likelihood, I would say guilty.''</p>
        <p>The defendants are accused of participating in a ''North American support cell'' that provided money, goods and recruits abroad to assist ''global jihad.''</p>
        <p>A convert to Islam, Mr. Padilla, now 36, was arrested in 2002 at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. He was designated an enemy combatant and transferred to military custody, where he was held without charges.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration described him then as an operative of Al Qaeda on a mission to detonate a radioactive ''dirty bomb'' and blow up apartment buildings. But his indictment in 2005 did not mention those accusations.</p>
        <p>In January 2006, the Supreme Court granted the administration's request to transfer Mr. Padilla to civilian custody. A federal appeals court had earlier refused the transfer, saying it appeared the government was trying to manipulate the system to prevent the Supreme Court from reviewing whether Mr. Padilla could be held indefinitely as an enemy combatant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Padilla, who appeared in court wearing a suit and tie, smiled and waved at his mother and brother, seated in the courtroom. If convicted, he could face a life sentence.</p>
        <p>The other defendants are Adham Amin Hassoun, 45, a Lebanese-born Palestinian, and Kifah Wael Jayyousi, 44, a Jordanian-born American citizen.</p>

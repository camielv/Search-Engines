        <p>The amazing thing is how familiar campus shootings have become. For viewers, initial disbelief is quickly folded into a methodical ritual of breaking bad news. News trucks race to the scene, witnesses upload images recorded on cellphones and video cameras, students on the scene calmly and patiently recount their impressions in front of news cameras.

        <p>Television anchors said over and over that the shooting rampage at Virginia Tech was the deadliest in American history, but that was not the only shocking aspect of yesterday's continual coverage.</p>
        <p>The amazing thing is how familiar campus shootings have become. For viewers, initial disbelief is quickly folded into a methodical ritual of breaking bad news. News trucks race to the scene, witnesses upload images recorded on cellphones and video cameras, students on the scene calmly and patiently recount their impressions in front of news cameras. One student was taped soberly expressing shock -- and cognizance. ''This is like a college Columbine,'' he said on MSNBC. ''Really sad.''</p>
        <p>Grief counselors were dispatched to the campus, while clinical psychologists and former F.B.I. profilers crowded the airwaves with their own form of grief counseling, talking authoritatively about ''narcissistic injury'' and a gunman who had carefully ''put together his killing package,'' as Clint Van Zandt, a former F.B.I. hostage negotiator described him on MSNBC.</p>
        <p>Hours before the death toll was certain or the identity of the gunman was known, television was already in an oft-practiced gear: senseless death-as-usual.</p>
        <p>Or, as William Lassiter, manager of the Center for the Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, N.C., put it on MSNBC, '' I can't believe another one of these has happened.''</p>
        <p>The most disturbing thing on the screen was the sound recorded on Jamal Albarghouti's cellphone camera outside Norris Hall -- the sharp blast of a gun or guns firing over and over. Mr. Albarghouti, a student, told CNN that he thought at first that the police were responding to a bomb threat. Ordered to the ground by officers, he kept his cellphone on and aloft as shot after shot rang out, then at 11 a.m. sent his material to ''I-Reports,'' a section on the CNN Web site that solicits news and disaster images from bystanders. After giving Mr. Albarghouti a contract for exclusive use, CNN put the clip on the air half an hour later under the I-Report logo. By evening, CNN.com had recorded 1.8 million hits on that clip.</p>
        <p>There must have been a time -- maybe back in 1966 before live news coverage was common and Charles Whitman opened fire from a clock tower at the University of Texas in Austin and killed 16 people -- when witnesses, officials and news announcers would find themselves at a loss for words.</p>
        <p>The shootings at Columbine High School near Littleton, Colo., in 1999 defined how mass shootings are handled -- and publicly mourned. There have been similar tragedies since then, too many. Now everybody knows the drill.</p>
        <p>Virginia Tech's president, Charles W. Steger, held news conferences and described the shooting as a tragedy of ''monumental proportions.'' President Bush went on the air to express the nation's sorrow. President Jacques Chirac of France conveyed the condolences of his country. And the networks swooped in. Katie Couric flew to Blacksburg, Va., to interview survivors and anchor a special edition of the ''CBS Evening News,'' and so did Brian Williams with the ''NBC Nightly News.'' ABC News announced that its ''World News'' anchor Charles Gibson would be there on Tuesday and that ''Nightline'' on Monday would be devoted to the campus massacre.</p>
        <p>It was the worst shooting ever, but it was also yet another tragedy in which television turned first to amateur reporters on the scene. ''Stay out of harm's way,'' the CNN anchor Don Lemon said, addressing students at Virginia Tech. ''But send us your pictures and video.''</p>

        <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Monday that his fellow Republicans ''forgot who we were'' in recent years by spending too much, and said that as president he would rely on low taxes, greater fiscal restraint and free trade to lift the nation's economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, whose presidential campaign has been viewed with suspicion by some conservatives because of his initial opposition to the Bush administration's tax cuts, used the first major economic address of his campaign to reaffirm his commitment to the free market but said he would move to overhaul the nation's unemployment programs to help people find jobs in the new economy. And he had some strong words for the way his fellow Republicans governed when they controlled Congress.</p>

        <p>Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Monday that his fellow Republicans ''forgot who we were'' in recent years by spending too much, and said that as president he would rely on low taxes, greater fiscal restraint and free trade to lift the nation's economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, whose presidential campaign has been viewed with suspicion by some conservatives because of his initial opposition to the Bush administration's tax cuts, used the first major economic address of his campaign to reaffirm his commitment to the free market but said he would move to overhaul the nation's unemployment programs to help people find jobs in the new economy. And he had some strong words for the way his fellow Republicans governed when they controlled Congress.</p>
        <p>''Worst of all, we forgot who we were: tight-fisted stewards of the federal treasury who keep our priorities straight,'' Mr. McCain said in a speech to the Economic Club of Memphis. ''We asked Americans to make us the governing party, and we rewarded them by becoming the party of government.''</p>
        <p>After complaining that Congress had spent money on an indoor rain forest and studying the DNA of bears in Montana (''without knowing whether we needed to solve a criminal case or a paternity suit''), Mr. McCain restated his support for giving the president a line-item veto. Even without it, though, he pledged vetoes of pork-laden bills that drive up government spending without improving government services.</p>
        <p>''My goodness, when disaster strikes, the government isn't even ready to deliver drinking water to dehydrated babies or rescue the aged and infirm trapped in a hospital with no electricity,'' he said, in an apparent allusion to the government's response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain spoke strongly in favor of free trade but said the government needed to adjust to help workers who had lost their jobs in a changing economy. ''We have an unemployment insurance program straight out of the 1950s,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He proposed combining government programs for the unemployed and new emphasis on training, education and relocation assistance.</p>
        <p>Turning to a subject that has been politically sensitive for him, Mr. McCain said he would continue to support the Bush tax cuts.</p>
        <p>''I won't balance the budget by allowing the president's income and investment tax cuts to expire,'' he said. The problem, he explained, was that ''when we passed those tax cuts, we increased spending as well.''</p>
        <p>Still, some conservatives continued to express skepticism.</p>
        <p>Pat Toomey, the president of the Club for Growth, an anti-tax group, said: ''While Senator McCain deserves credit for his support for free trade, limited spending and extending the Bush tax cuts, his record of opposing tax cuts speaks louder than his words today.''</p>

        <p>AS the tax deadline looms tonight, there are those who think that the pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service might as well be declaimed in Greek.</p>
        <p>But consider the fix of Chinatown residents who would settle for mere Mandarin.</p>
        <p>So it was that Jiang Hua, 70, a retired busboy who has lived in Chinatown for the last 15 years, found himself on the second floor of the Chinese Community Center on Mott Street last Friday.</p>
        <p>For years, Baruch College has offered free tax advice from hundreds of trained and certified students. And in the heart of Chinatown, about a dozen Chinese-speaking students from Baruch have been helping mostly elderly Chinese who speak little English.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hua sat down stiffly at a table, removed the two rubber bands from the envelopes that contained his tax forms and contemplated the mysteries of itemized allowable deductions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hua spoke only Mandarin, as different from the other major Chinese dialect, Cantonese, as a Texas twang is from a Scottish brogue.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Tsu, 21, from Sunset Park, Brooklyn, also speaks Mandarin. She is majoring in accounting. Sitting down, she wore pink Converse sneakers, her left leg tucked under her right.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tsu attacked Mr. Hua's tax return with a fast pen (and a nearby bottle of liquid paper) and an even faster calculator. It was a simple return, she said.</p>
        <p>For many in Chinatown, it would be neither a rich nor a delicious irony that the emperor of China, Wang Mang, known as the Usurper, introduced a form of income tax in A.D. 10.</p>
        <p>The tax was on the profits earned by professionals and skilled laborers, according to Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit organization that publishes the magazine Tax Notes.</p>
        <p>Perhaps a better emperor to blame, Mr. Thorndike said, would be Napoleon. In 1798, William Pitt the Younger, the British prime minister, introduced the first true income tax to pay for armaments against the French.</p>
        <p>At the community center, perhaps because the deadline was near, the atmosphere seemed tense.</p>
        <p>Lucy Ma, 62, a home health care attendant, spoke quickly, raised her eyebrows, her mouth forming an ''o,'' as she told Helen Yu, 19, a Baruch sophomore majoring in psychology, her tax situation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yu stood up to get some advice, but Ms. Ma, concerned, grabbed her right arm. Ms. Yu said something soothing and soon three more Baruch students were huddled around Ms. Ma, looking at her forms.</p>
        <p>Someone else whispered an explanation: Ms. Ma wants a bigger refund.</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Clarence Norman Jr., the former leader of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, was sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court to one to three years in prison for extortion. The sentence, less than the minimum of two and one-third to seven years, will begin after two other consecutive sentences of one to three years that Mr. Norman received after other corruption trials. In four trials on separate corruption charges, Mr. Norman was convicted three times and acquitted once. In the most recent trial, prosecutors described a plan to shake down judicial candidates in exchange for party support. The Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, said in a statement, ''This trial showed how Clarence Norman manipulated the judicial selection system and perverted the way judges are elected in this county.''</p>

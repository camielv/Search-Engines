        <p>Federal regulators have made business life a bit easier for the heart device maker Guidant by approving revised quality controls for its pacemaker and defibrillator operations.</p>
        <p>The move by the Food and Drug Administration spurred the stock of Boston Scientific, which acquired the Guidant operations a year ago.</p>
        <p>The agency's action, which Boston Scientific announced yesterday, lifted the cloud cast by an agency warning letter sent to Guidant in December 2005 and should make it easier for Boston Scientific to introduce improvements in Guidant's heart-regulating implants.</p>
        <p>And it raised hopes on Wall Street that Guidant could sell more of the highly profitable devices, which cost as much as $30,000.</p>
        <p>Shares of Boston Scientific jumped 99 cents, or 6.6 percent, to close at $16, in heavy trading.</p>
        <p>Boston Scientific, based in Natick, Mass., is not yet out of the regulatory woods. The company is still working to deal with a separate agency warning letter it received in January 2006, before it acquired Guidant.</p>
        <p>That letter chastised Boston Scientific for failing to collect, analyze and report problems that patients and doctors had with several of its cardiovascular devices. It cited hundreds of shortcomings discovered at six factories the agency inspected in 2004 and 2005.</p>
        <p>Paul Donovan, a spokesman for Boston Scientific, said that the F.D.A.'s approval of Guidant's revised quality-control systems would allow distribution of four ''minor software upgrades'' to current Guidant products.</p>
        <p>The January 2006 warning is still holding up regulatory approval of two devices important to the future of Boston Scientific: its new drug-coated stent for coronary arteries, the Taxus Liberté, and its first stent for the neck arteries that carry blood to the brain, called NexStent.</p>
        <p>Stents are small wire-mesh cylinders that help keep blood vessels propped open after blockages have been removed.</p>
        <p>At the time of the January 2006 warning letter, Boston Scientific had hoped for clearance to introduce the Taxus Liberté into the $3.2 billion domestic stent market as early as last September. Now the company says it expects to be ready for federal reinspection of its factories by this summer.</p>
        <p>Based on F.D.A. procedures in completing such reviews, it was unlikely that the regulatory restrictions would be lifted before the end of this year, at the earliest.</p>

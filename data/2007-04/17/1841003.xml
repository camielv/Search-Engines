        <p>IntelSat, which runs the world's largest network of communications satellites, has been put up for sale by the private equity funds that own it, according to people close to the company.</p>
        <p>The company, which is based in Bermuda and managed from Washington, was bought for $3.1 billion in 2004 by Madison Dearborn Partners, Apax Partners, Permira and Apollo Management.</p>
        <p>The sale was prompted, the people said, because it had been approached by the Blackstone Group, another private equity fund, with an offer to buy IntelSat for $6 billion. IntelSat has hired Credit Suisse to seek other bidders, a process likely to take at least two months, the people said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for IntelSat did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>The practice of a private equity firm buying a company from another, once relatively rare, is becoming more common, in what is called a secondary buyout. The current owners of IntelSat have already increased the company's debt to $11 billion, and if Blackstone followed its typical pattern, it would add even more.</p>

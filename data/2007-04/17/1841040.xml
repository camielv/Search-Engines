        <p>Nearly a third of the estimated 260,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel are living in poverty and struggling to get state medical services or sufficient pensions, according to a report by the Holocaust Survivors' Welfare Fund. The report, timed to coincide with Holocaust Remembrance Day, was delivered to Parliament on Sunday. Hundreds of survivors, advocates and students marched outside the building in protest. ''We keep being very critical of those who have not admitted guilt or deny that there was a Holocaust, but here we are ignoring the people who are living in dire poverty,'' said Collette Avital, a member of Parliament who advocates for Holocaust survivors. Isaac Herzog, the social affairs minister, asked to take control of the care for Holocaust survivors, now under the Finance Ministry. ''I feel deeply ashamed,'' he said.</p>

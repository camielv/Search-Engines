        <p>Because of an editing error, an article on March 12 about the latest New York Times Scholars misstated the profession of Ernest Abrahamson, who along with his wife, Kathleen, has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the scholarship program. (The error first appeared in an article on March 14, 2002, about that year's Times Scholars.) Mr. Abrahamson is an entrepreneur and the chairman of a manufacturing company; he is not an engineer. Mr. Abrahamson pointed out the error last week.</p>

        <p>Since the Guggenheim Museum opened in 1959, Frank Lloyd Wright's massive spiral facade has been showing signs of cracking, mainly from seasonal temperature fluctuations that cause the concrete walls, built without expansion joints, to contract and expand. While museum officials say the facade is structurally sound, they have spent the last year inspecting each crack to devise a repair plan. On Saturday the museum opened ''Restoring a Masterpiece,'' an exhibition (on view through July 8) that chronicles its process. The display includes a diagram that shows each crack on the building's west side.</p>

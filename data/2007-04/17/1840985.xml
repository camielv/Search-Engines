        <p>MORE TRANS-ATLANTIC COMPETITION Zoom Airlines, based in Ottawa, plans to begin service between Kennedy International Airport and London Gatwick Airport on June 21, with round-trip coach fares starting at about $510, including taxes and fees. Zoom says it will offer both economy and premium- economy cabins with meals.</p>
        <p>EOS ADDS SERVICE Eos Airlines, the discount all- business-class carrier, expanded its schedule to add a third flight between Kennedy International Airport and Stansted Airport in London. The additional flight will leave from Kennedy on Sundays, Mondays and Fridays and from Gatwick on Sundays, Mondays and Fridays.</p>
        <p>AMERICAN AIRLINES PROTEST Flight attendants for American Airlines will be picketing at domestic airports today to protest $180 million in bonuses the carrier is preparing to pay to about 1,000 top managers, according to the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents nearly 20,000 flight attendants at American. In 2003, the flight attendants at American agreed to significant cuts in pay as the airline and others in the industry faced serious financial strain.</p>
        <p>RENT PARTY United Airlines is charging customers at Los Angeles International Airport an extra $10 a ticket, citing the ''sharp increase in costs to operate at LAX'' after the airport imposed a rent increase on all airlines. Last year, United had 4.9 million passengers at the airport. Assuming the same number of passengers this year, the approximately $49 million in extra revenue to United ''wildly exceeds'' the airline's $10 million rent increase, said Los Angeles World Airports, the parent agency of the airport. Other carriers have officially protested the rent increases, but only United had so far added a surcharge to fares.</p>
        <p>MOVING CARS As the so-called snowbird people population migrates from Arizona back north, Budget Rent a Car is offering discounts to customers heading to California. Through June 23, rates for those traveling one way from Tucson International Airport or Sky Harbor Airport of Phoenix to select airports in California range from $17.95 a day for an economy car to $21.95 for a full-size vehicle, though with limited availability. Among the California drop-off locations are airports in Burbank, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco.</p>
        <p>HOW LOW? Ryanair, the popular low-fare, no-frills European carrier, hopes to start a new airline with service by 2010 to the United States from its 23 European bases with one-way coach fares as low as $12, according to the chief executive, Michael O'Leary, in an interview with Flight International. Mr. O'Leary, who has previously proposed in-flight casino-type gambling as a revenue source to keep fares low, told the trade magazine that he expected the low-fare international airline would depend on sales of food, drink, duty-free goods and in-flight entertainment for extra revenue.</p>
        <p>NEW HYATT BRAND Hyatt is starting a new luxury brand, Andaz, emphasizing boutique environments with local identity, but without the ''attitude'' that characterizes some urban boutique hotels, said Mark S. Hoplamazian, the chief executive of Global Hyatt. The first hotel under the Andaz brand will be in London's financial district, where the Hyatt-operated Great Eastern Hotel is being refurbished.</p>

        <p>Gere's Kiss Ignites Protests  Richard Gere touched off demonstrations and protests in India when he planted several kisses on the face of the actress and ''Celebrity Big Brother'' winner Shilpa Shetty, right, at an AIDS awareness rally in New Delhi, the BBC reported. Public displays of affection remain largely taboo in India. Demonstrators in Mumbai burned effigies of Mr. Gere, and protesters in other cities demanded ''Death to Shilpa Shetty.'' Ms. Shetty told Press Trust of India: ''This was not such a big thing for people to overreact in such a manner. I understand people's sentiments, but I don't want a foreigner to take bad memories from here. I understand this is his culture, not ours.''</p>
        <p>Where Artists And Filmmakers Intersect  Renowned contemporary artists, including Chuck Close, Nan Goldin, Kiki Smith, Bruce Weber, Joseph Kosuth and Stephen Hannock, will take part in this year's Tribeca Film Festival Artists Award Program by contributing works to be given to the top 13 festival winners. The paintings, photographs, prints, sculptures and posters will be exhibited at Gallery Viet Nam, 345 Greenwich Street, near Harrison Street, from April 25 through May 2, before being presented at the festival's awards ceremony on May 2.</p>
        <p>Edward Norton Hulks Up  Edward Norton, below, has signed to play the title role in ''The Incredible Hulk,'' a successor to ''Hulk,'' the 2003 Ang Lee film, which starred Eric Bana as Bruce Banner, whose volatile temper causes him to metamorphose into a green-skinned behemoth. Mr. Norton has been nominated for Academy Awards for his performances in ''American History X'' and ''Primal Fear.'' In the new adventure for the Marvel Comics superhero, Bruce Banner will be on the run while attempting to cure his condition. The film, to be directed by Louis Leterrier (''Transporter 2,'' ''Unleashed'') will be released in June 2008. Filming begins this summer in Toronto. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst walked the red carpet yesterday in Tokyo, where ''Spider-Man 3'' had its premiere, Agence France-Presse reported. The latest adventure of Spider-Man, played by Mr. Maguire, will open officially in Japan, the world's second-largest market, on May 1, three days before its United States premiere.</p>
        <p>Hockney Landscapes At Tate Britain  Five new paintings of the East Yorkshire landscape by the Los Angeles-based British artist David Hockney, who turns 70 on July 9, will be seen for the first time in Britain at a major exhibition in June at Tate Britain in London. Mr. Hockney will also help to organize an exhibition of 165 watercolors by J. M. W. Turner, also scheduled to open in June. The show will include ''The Blue Rigi,''' saved from leaving Britain after a Tate-led campaign to raise the $9.8 million needed to buy it for the nation. Germany's culture minister, Bernd Neumann, has rejected a campaign from a Hamburg-based lobbying group to send the famous 14th-century B.C. painted limestone bust of Nefertiti from the Altes Museum in Berlin to Egypt on loan, Bloomberg News reported. ''Experts,'' Mr. Neumann said, ''are of the view that there are serious conservation and restoration concerns that argue against any long-distance transportation of Nefertiti.''</p>
        <p>Demands Win Freedom For Bugs  Insects and reptiles have been removed from an exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia, after the local Humane Society said their living conditions were cruel, The Globe and Mail of Toronto reported. The creatures were displayed in a terrarium called ''Theater of the World'' in ''House of Oracles,'' a 40-piece retrospective devoted to the work of the renowned Chinese artist Huang Yong Ping. Daina Augaitis, the chief curator, said the gallery had collaborated with a veterinarian and the humane society to ensure that no creatures were harmed during the making of the art. Peter Fricker, a spokesman for the Vancouver Humane Society, said the enclosure was designed to encourage aggression. The show is headed for Beijing in the fall.</p>
        <p>BBC Invites Europe To the Dance  The popular Eurovision Song Competition is going to be joined by the Eurovision Dance Contest, with the BBC as the host. In the competition, professional and amateur dancers will represent 13 countries, and a vote by viewers will decide the winner. In the two-hour show, to be broadcast from London in the fall, each couple will perform two dances, with the second having what the BBC calls a ''national flavor.'' A commentator will describe performances and their artistic content, and viewers will vote on the overall performance, including dancing, choreography, costume and choice of music. The participating couples will come from Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine.</p>

        <p>The Winter Olympics are coming to Vancouver in 2010, and Canada's team is boasting that it will ''own the podium.'' If a bill before Parliament is passed, the organizers of those games will own something even more rarefied: the trademark on the word ''winter.''</p>
        <p>With little fanfare, the Canadian government recently introduced legislation that breaks with conventional trademark law and would grant the Vancouver organizing committee rights to ''winter'' and a long list of other common words, among them: ''gold,'' ''silver,'' ''medals,'' ''sponsor,'' ''games,'' ''21st,'' ''2010,'' as well as the name of the host city itself. The legislation would also give the committee special enforcement powers.</p>
        <p>The measure is part of a worldwide effort by the brand-conscious International Olympic Committee to thwart what it calls ''ambush campaigns,'' sports-themed advertising during the Olympics by companies that are not Olympic sponsors.</p>
        <p>Other countries, including Britain, have passed similar legislation. But in Canada the plan has met with criticism from those who dislike the notion of common words becoming private property, even temporarily. The law would expire at the end of 2010.</p>
        <p>Under the proposed law, however, marketers would infringe on the new trademarks only if they used the protected words in certain combinations. For instance, ''gold medals,'' or ''Vancouver 2010.''</p>
        <p>''It's highly problematic,'' said Michael Geist, a law professor at the University of Ottawa who first raised criticisms of the proposed law. ''It creates the prospect of a David and Goliath fight over free speech.''</p>
        <p>Doug Clark, the director of patent policy at Industry Canada, a government department, said the measures are part of a Canadian government promise to the International Olympic Committee ''to ensure protection for the Olympic brand and to prevent ambush advertising.'' (Journalists are exempted from the law.)</p>
        <p>When asked why the government was not offering to outlaw ambush advertising for other large, limited-time events like concerts, Mr. Clark replied: ''Rock concerts are not publicly subsidized events. Rock concerts do not cost $2.45 billion.''</p>
        <p>The law would also allow the organizing committee, a private group, to act like a government agency when it comes to enforcement. That means it would be able to obtain a court injunction without proving that an infringement of its trademark for, say, ''winter games,'' has caused it ''undue harm.''</p>
        <p>Scott Brison, a member of the opposition Liberal Party, said that he would seek to modify the bill, particularly focusing on its inclusion of common words.</p>
        <p>''Generally we support protecting the Olympic brand,'' Mr. Brison said. ''But we are concerned that any proposed remedy is absolutely defensible and does not unduly compromise the rights of citizens and individual businesses.''</p>

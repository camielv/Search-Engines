        <p>An off-duty New York City police officer was shot in the hand during a possible attempted robbery early yesterday, the Nassau County police said. The 25-year-old officer, whom the Nassau police did not identify, was treated at Nassau University Medical Center and then released. At 4 a.m., the off-duty officer was sitting in his car, which was parked on Kinkel Street between Prospect Avenue and Broadway, when a man with a handgun approached. A fight ensued, and the officer drove off after he was wounded in the left hand, the police said. The assailant was still at large last night.</p>

        <p>What was expected to be an elegant, high-scoring national semifinal game between Tennessee and North Carolina quickly became an artless grind Sunday night at the women's Final Four.</p>
        <p>In the chaos, players were as ungainly shooting layups as 3-pointers. Balls bounced off hands as clumsily as they bounced off the rim. Passes were frequently stolen, then handed right back. In 40 minutes, the two teams combined for 50 turnovers.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Tennessee proved more adept at disorder, or slightly less ragged, overcoming a 12-point deficit with a 20-2 run in the final 8 minutes 18 seconds to defeat the Tar Heels, 56-50.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the Lady Volunteers (33-3) will face Rutgers as they seek their seventh national championship under Coach Pat Summitt and their first since 1998.</p>
        <p>''We kept talking about, 'We can do this, we will do this,' '' Summitt said. ''If you ask me today, it's probably the best win of my career.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps it is more accurate to say that Tennessee did not so much win as North Carolina (34-4) lost, in the most excruciating way imaginable. The Tar Heels took a 48-36 lead with 8:18 left but did not score another field goal, collecting a mere two free throws down the stretch.</p>
        <p>Point guard Ivory Latta stood and flexed her arms after a play in which she drove for a layup and drew a foul, giving the Tar Heels a 46-36 lead. But the celebration was premature.</p>
        <p>North Carolina's collapse began when guard Camille Little and center LaToya Pringle fouled out with the Tar Heels ahead by 48-42. To that point, Tennessee forward Candace Parker, considered by many the best player in the country, had shot 2 for 12 from the field.</p>
        <p>Now unencumbered, Parker made a pair of free throws and snaked under the basket for a layup as the Lady Volunteers drew to 48-46. With 37 seconds left, Parker stole the ball in a double team and hit two more free throws to put Tennessee ahead, 53-50. Although Parker shot only 3 for 12 from the field, she played insistently and finished with 14 points and 13 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Latta, the other all-American in the game, scored 13 points, but she shot only 4 for 13, contributed only 3 assists against 6 turnovers and missed repeatedly from the perimeter in the closing minutes.</p>
        <p>Tennessee prevailed although it shot 17 for 63 (27 percent) from the field. In doing so, the Lady Volunteers exorcised much recent frustration against North Carolina. Last Dec. 3, the Tar Heels defeated Tennessee, 70-57. And it was North Carolina that ousted the Lady Volunteers from the 2006 N.C.A.A. tournament in the Cleveland Regional final.</p>
        <p>North Carolina opened Sunday's game with particular futility, missing its first 13 shots. With 12:28 remaining in the first half, Parker drew a charging foul -- her second personal foul -- and went to the bench until halftime with 4 points.</p>
        <p>Latta soon followed her to the bench with two assists and three turnovers, leaving her feet on the defensive perimeter and awkwardly drawing her third foul with 8:57 left in the half.</p>
        <p>Neither team could establish control, with Tennessee shooting 7 for 29 and North Carolina 9 for 32. Nobody scored in double figures in the first 20 minutes as the Lady Volunteers committed 14 turnovers and the Tar Heels 15.</p>
        <p>Three times in the half, Tennessee failed to launch a shot before the 30-second clock expired. Still, the Lady Volunteers managed a tenuous advantage, 22-21, one that they improbably reclaimed in the final eight minutes.</p>

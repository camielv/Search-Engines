        <p>If William Christie's fans had their way, his visits to New York would always be to lead a fully staged production of one of the French Baroque operas that he performs with incomparable persuasiveness. But in recent years Mr. Christie has added another arrow to his quiver that is no less important. To ensure a steady supply of singers versed in Baroque style, he started Le Jardin des Voix in 2002. An academy for young singers at the Théâtre de Caen in northern France, the program also offers a valedictory tour, which brought this year's crop of 10 singers to Alice Tully Hall on Saturday evening.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christie seems to have sought a variety of timbres and vocal weights in selecting his singers. Among the four sopranos Claire Meghnagi had the most strikingly operatic sound, in terms of projection, power and suppleness, qualities she put to superb use in the Prologue from Monteverdi's ''Orfeo.'' In Handel's ''M'hai resa infelice'' Sonya Yoncheva sang with a darker timbre but also a silkiness similar to Ms. Meghnagi's.</p>

        <p>If William Christie's fans had their way, his visits to New York would always be to lead a fully staged production of one of the French Baroque operas that he performs with incomparable persuasiveness. But in recent years Mr. Christie has added another arrow to his quiver that is no less important. To ensure a steady supply of singers versed in Baroque style, he started Le Jardin des Voix in 2002. An academy for young singers at the Théâtre de Caen in northern France, the program also offers a valedictory tour, which brought this year's crop of 10 singers to Alice Tully Hall on Saturday evening.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christie seems to have sought a variety of timbres and vocal weights in selecting his singers. Among the four sopranos Claire Meghnagi had the most strikingly operatic sound, in terms of projection, power and suppleness, qualities she put to superb use in the Prologue from Monteverdi's ''Orfeo.'' In Handel's ''M'hai resa infelice'' Sonya Yoncheva sang with a darker timbre but also a silkiness similar to Ms. Meghnagi's.</p>
        <p>Laura Hynes Smith, a former jazz singer who took up classical music more recently, produced a more tightly focused timbre that wanted something in lushness, although her account of Piccini's ''Furia di donna irata'' suggested that she had cornered the market on fireworks and high notes. And Francesca Boncompagni, heard only in ensemble pieces, has a light, lyric soprano, less powerful than the others but attractive in its more modest way.</p>
        <p>Of the tenors Pascal Charbonneau had the most opulent, fully projected tone, but his colleagues had much to recommend them. Juan Sancho had a smaller, more lyrical sound, but he and Mr. Charbonneau blended effectively in Monteverdi's ''Mentre vaga Angioletta.'' Nicholas Watts, whose solo turn was ''Possente spirito'' from ''Orfeo,'' had the least to offer in vocal color but considerable agility and a fine command of Baroque ornamentation.</p>
        <p>The other ranges were represented by only one singer each. Michal Czerniawski demonstrated a firmly supported, attractive countertenor in Cavalli's ''Lucidissima face'' and in duets with Ms. Yoncheva and Ms. Meghnagi. Amaya Dominguez, a mezzo-soprano, offered a characterful rendering of Handel's ''Vo' far guerra.'' And if Jonathan Sells's bass was generally underpowered, his sepulchral low notes resonated nicely.</p>
        <p>Les Arts Florissants played with its customary verve, and Elsa Rooke's semistaging -- a lot of slow-motion ambling and posing, hand gestures and a bit of kneeling and shoe throwing -- was better than the usual stand-and-sing approach, when it didn't distract from both the music and the singers.</p>

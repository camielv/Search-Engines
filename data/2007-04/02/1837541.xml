        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your March 28 news article about David Hicks, the Australian imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay who pleaded guilty to providing material support to a terrorist organization:</p>
        <p>You say ''the rules in the military commissions are singular,'' but ''the pressures and calculations were much like those that weigh on people in civilian courts.'' Perhaps, but there are some differences.</p>
        <p>In civilian courts, defendants have not been held for five years, nor does the state assert the right to hold them indefinitely without trial or without bringing charges.</p>
        <p>In most civilian courts, the judge does not disqualify two out of the three defense lawyers as a trial is about to start. Nor does the judge threaten the remaining defense lawyer with prosecution for criticizing the secretary of defense and the president.</p>
        <p>Jay Livingston  New York, March 28, 2007</p>

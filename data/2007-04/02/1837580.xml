        <p>A woman and her former husband were fatally shot last night in a house in Elmont, on Long Island, and investigators were trying to locate the couple's 20-year-old son, the Nassau County police said.</p>
        <p>The couple, described as a man in his 50s and a woman in her 40s, were not identified by the police pending family notification.</p>
        <p>The man and the woman were divorced, and only the woman lived at the home with their son, said Detective Lt. Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the Nassau police. It was unclear why the ex-husband had been at the house, he said.</p>
        <p>The police said that they had no suspects last night, but that several neighbors said they saw a dark car leave the house at 1310 Post Avenue about 5:45 p.m., which was about the same time a 911 call came in from a neighbor. Police investigators believe that the two were shot shortly before the call came in. They were declared dead at the scene about 5:50 p.m.</p>
        <p>The couple had lived in the neighborhood for at least seven years, according to neighbors.</p>

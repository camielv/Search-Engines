        <p>It's a perfect match. Kele Okereke has questions. For instance: ''Is it wrong to want rewarding? To want more than is given to you?'' And the Rev. Frederick Eikerenkoetter, better known as Rev. Ike, has answers. For instance: ''Life takes from the taker and gives to the giver.''</p>
        <p>You might not think these two would have much in common. Mr. Okereke is a 25-year-old from Britain, born to Nigerian parents, who leads the jittery post-punk band Bloc Party. And Rev. Ike is the ostentatious preacher who built an empire by promising followers that piety and prosperity go hand in hand. In 1969 Rev. Ike found himself a suitably grand home: a 3,293-seat Loews theater in Washington Heights, at Broadway and 175th Street.</p>

        <p>You might not think these two would have much in common. Mr. Okereke is a 25-year-old from Britain, born to Nigerian parents, who leads the jittery post-punk band Bloc Party. And Rev. Ike is the ostentatious preacher who built an empire by promising followers that piety and prosperity go hand in hand. In 1969 Rev. Ike found himself a suitably grand home: a 3,293-seat Loews theater in Washington Heights, at Broadway and 175th Street.</p>
        <p>He still preaches there, but the room, known as the United Palace Theater, is also available for rent, and the church says it's a bargain. (For prospective renters, a shameless tagline: ''Don't let 'ungodly' costs run you away from New York!'') Now it doubles as a concert hall. That explains what Bloc Party was doing on Rev. Ike's home turf on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>The concert, the second of two sold-out appearances by Bloc Party, was promoted by Bowery Presents and was the first of an impressive series of shows at United Palace. (Also scheduled: Iggy and the Stooges on April 9; Tego Calder√≥n on April 14; Modest Mouse on April 29 and 30; Bjork on May 5; and Arcade Fire on May 7 and 8.) Despite an overhang that muffled the sound a bit, the room sounded great, and the ushers didn't freak when fans rushed the aisles to dance by the stage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Okereke and his bandmates were here to celebrate ''A Weekend in the City'' (Vice/Atlantic), their gloomy but spirited second album. It's hard to be optimistic about a CD, or a concert, that begins with the line, ''I am trying to be heroic in an age of modernity.'' On Saturday night the mood improved when the band came crashing in, which is exactly what happens on the CD. Fans cheered, and Mr. Okereke beamed; an exchange like that never gets old.</p>
        <p>''A Weekend in the City'' often sags under the weight of Mr. Okereke's sighing: ''We're so handsome and we're so bored/So entertain us,'' he moans. (Smells like teen dispiritedness.) In some ways it feels like a paradigmatic second album, a slightly overwrought reaction to the acclaim that greeted Bloc Party's fiery, danceable debut, ''Silent Alarm.'' But it has its moments, especially ''I Still Remember,'' a tantalizing account of a gay romance that never quite happens. And on Saturday night the members proved that their greatest asset is antsiness. Matt Tong, the drummer, plays fast but glitchy, so that the rhythm never stays steady; even the slower songs were all herky-jerky.</p>
        <p>By the end a few adventurous concertgoers were trying to stage-dive, propelled by the sharpened beat of ''Helicopter,'' an older song. And then the field trip was over: thousands of fans filed into the lobby, where Rev. Ike's words of wisdom hung, and then into the streets to head (one presumes) back downtown or back to Brooklyn, making a night commute that will become more common in the coming months.</p>

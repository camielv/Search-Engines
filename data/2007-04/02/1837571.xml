        <p>Martina McBride  Waking Up Laughing  (RCA/Sony BMG Nashville)</p>
        <p>''I got pitched every social issue song on the planet.'' That's how the country singer Martina McBride describes her career in the time after ''Independence Day,'' her hit single about a battered woman turned arsonist. She is too canny a star -- and too good a singer -- to be pigeonholed, but she certainly hasn't shied away from the ''social issue song.'' Her recent singles include ''Concrete Angel,'' about an abused daughter, and ''God's Will,'' about a brave little boy battling some deadly disease. (Can you guess his name?)</p>

        <p>Martina McBride  Waking Up Laughing  (RCA/Sony BMG Nashville)</p>
        <p>''I got pitched every social issue song on the planet.'' That's how the country singer Martina McBride describes her career in the time after ''Independence Day,'' her hit single about a battered woman turned arsonist. She is too canny a star -- and too good a singer -- to be pigeonholed, but she certainly hasn't shied away from the ''social issue song.'' Her recent singles include ''Concrete Angel,'' about an abused daughter, and ''God's Will,'' about a brave little boy battling some deadly disease. (Can you guess his name?)</p>
        <p>Perhaps those songs should have been pretty deadly too, but they weren't. More than just about any other singer Ms. McBride knows how to deliver a heavy-handed message with a light touch. Because she keeps her phrasing gentle as the melody soars, you get the feeling she really likes these characters, who suffer so much on her behalf.</p>
        <p>There's plenty of suffering on ''Waking Up Laughing.'' A girlfriend is verbally abused, a niece is molested, a pregnant bride is married and then miscarries; no one does suburban melodrama like Ms. McBride. Yet the mood is upbeat, as the title suggests. This is the first Martina McBride album she produced herself, without her longtime collaborator, Paul Worley. And if she's feeling a bit giddy, maybe you can hear it in the opening track, a gleeful goodbye song that builds to a cheerful insult: ''If I had your name/I'd be changing it right now.''</p>
        <p>In ''I'll Still Be Me'' Ms. McBride claims to be ''just a normal girl from small-town nowhere'' (how come only celebrities ever make that claim?), then disproves ''normal'' with some soft and sublime high notes. ''For These Times'' gestures vaguely at politics before finally ascending into gospel. And ''Tryin' to Find a Reason'' is a first-rate power ballad with a surprisingly unsentimental message: ''Baby it's just time to walk away/If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay.''</p>
        <p>And then there's ''Anyway,'' which Ms. McBride wrote with the Warren Brothers, a country duo. Until now she has been known only as an interpreter, and this is an audacious way to branch out: with a supersized inspirational ballad. From the first piano chord you know what's coming: quiet verses, triumphant choruses, an avalanche of strings. But that doesn't make it any less pleasurable, the first time or the 15th.</p>
        <p>In the chorus Ms. McBride provides a memorable definition of faith: ''God is great, but sometimes life ain't good/When I pray it doesn't always turn out like I think it should/But I do it anyway.'' Last week ''Anyway'' held firm at No. 5 on Billboard's country chart. Will it make No. 1? Maybe that's beside the point. But here's hoping it does anyway.</p>

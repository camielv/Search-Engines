        <p>APPLE AND EMI HAVE NEWS -- A joint news conference by the chief executives of Apple Inc. and the EMI Group, scheduled for today, has encouraged speculation that the two may be preparing to make an announcement on making the Beatles available on an iPod or even a more radical shift toward selling digital music without copy protection. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>FIRST THE TOUR, THEN THE BOOK -- An increasing number of authors are enduring the pre-publication book tour, hoping to give their books a fighting chance in an industry that issues, by some estimates, more than 175,000 titles a year. [C1.]</p>
        <p>WARNER'S DIGITAL WATCHDOG -- Hollywood studios spent millions of dollars every year trying to get people to watch their movies. At Warner Brothers Entertainment, Darcy Antonellis is trying to get them to stop watching -- illegally, that is. [C1.]</p>
        <p>GUITAR TABLATURE ONLINE -- Because of an agreement in March between MusicNotes, an online music publisher, and the Harry Fox Agency, which represents 31,000 music publishers, guitar tablature -- a popular system for teaching and learning guitar -- will enter the legitimate business realm for the first time. E-Commerce Report: Bob Tedeschi. [C6.]</p>
        <p>PET FOOD, À LA CARTE -- With tainted pet food being blamed for at least 16 pet deaths -- and some veterinarians predicting hundreds more to follow -- preparing homemade lamb stew for the family pet suddenly sounds sensible. [C4.]</p>
        <p>WEB ACCESS, AND A COMPUTER -- A French Internet service provider, Neuf Cegetel, is developing a low-cost computer using open-source software in an effort to attract customers who are unable or unwilling to buy a computer as well as those who find Windows-based computers too technologically challenging. [C6.]</p>
        <p>FOUND IN TRANSLATION -- Lucifer Chu, a 31-year-old from Taipei, Taiwan, has made a small fortune in a relatively new business, popular Chinese translations of fantasy novels. And using much of the $1 million in royalties from his versions of ''The Lord of the Rings'' series, Mr. Chu says he now devotes himself to distributing free Chinese translations of material provided online by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, among others, as part of the OpenCourseWare project. Link by Link. [C3.]</p>
        <p>LOGOS ON 'IDOL' -- Some members of the studio audience for ''American Idol'' last week held up placards with the corporate logo of the former employer of a contestant, LaKisha Jones, left, which are forbidden under the show's rules. [C4.]</p>
        <p>A WHIFF OF ADS TO COME -- In the increasingly popular realm of scented advertising, guests at Omni luxury hotels will soon find small scented stickers on the front pages of their free copies of USA Today, exuding a blackberry aroma and suggesting that guests start the day with a cup of Starbucks coffee ''paired with a fresh muffin.'' Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C5.]</p>
        <p>THE NEW MAYTAG REPAIRMAN -- At a news conference today in Midtown Manhattan, Maytag will introduce Clay Jackson as the new Maytag repairman. Unlike his three predecessors, the tall (6 feet, 6 inches) Mr. Jackson is not an experienced actor. [C5.]</p>
        <p>RICH PRIZE FOR AN EFFICIENT CAR -- The same group that awarded $10 million to a team that built the first private spacecraft is preparing to start a contest for a commercially viable car that can run 100 miles on a gallon of gasoline. The price is expected to be more than $10 million. [C7.]</p>
        <p>HOW TO HANDLE A REPORTER -- Fred Vogelstein, contributing editor for Wired magazine, was preparing an article on Microsoft when he was inadvertently sent a 13-page memorandum written by the company's public relations firm to coach Microsoft's senior executives on how to handle his questions. [C4.]</p>
        <p>ADS BETWEEN THE LINES -- Fans of the rock bank Fall Out Boy who downloaded its new video last weekend also got a product placement ad for Tag All Nighter, a deodorant body spray aimed at young men. [C4.]</p>
        <p>LOOKING FOR A RADIO STAR -- The Public Radio Exchange, a nonprofit organization based in Cambridge, Mass., that connects independent radio producers and public radio stations looking for programming, is holding an online contest to find a new national radio star. [C6.]</p>

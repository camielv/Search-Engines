        <p>Tommy G. Thompson, the former governor of Wisconsin who served as President Bush's secretary of health and human services, said Sunday that he would seek the Republican nomination for president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson said he was the most ''reliable conservative'' among the already crowded field of Republican contenders. Moreover, he said that as a former governor and cabinet secretary he had experience in assembling state and federal budgets.</p>
        <p>In making his announcement on the ''This Week'' program on ABC, Mr. Thompson, who was born and raised in Wisconsin, said his strategy to overcome his current low ratings in early preference polls would be to concentrate his efforts on winning support in his native Midwest. He said that he had already visited much of Iowa, which holds the nation's first caucuses for presidential nominees.</p>
        <p>On Iraq, Mr. Thompson said he would have ''a completely different strategy'' than that of President Bush. He said that as president, he would require the Iraqi government to vote on whether it wanted United States troops to remain.</p>
        <p>''Nobody has ever asked that government, duly elected, to vote,'' he said. ''And if they want the United States in their country, it immediately gives a degree of legitimacy.'' If the Iraq government voted otherwise, he said, ''We would get out absolutely.''</p>
        <p>He also proposed a division of power among local governments in Iraq that would be matched by a division of oil revenues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, 65, was best known both as governor and health secretary for his social policy initiatives. In Wisconsin, he was lauded for an overhaul of welfare that became a national model. As health secretary, he was credited with adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare, the federal program for elderly and disabled citizens.</p>
        <p>When he departed the Bush administration in December 2004, he acknowledged an unslaked thirst for politics, suggesting he might run for governor or senator from Wisconsin.</p>

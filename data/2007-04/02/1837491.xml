        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) PRISON BREAK -- Time is running short in the season finale as Michael (Wentworth Miller, above with Sarah Wayne Callies) tries to save Lincoln (Dominic Purcell) by using the strategies of Mahone (William Fichtner) against him. Testimony at the trial of Sara (Ms. Callies) proves to be unexpected and possibly deadly. T-Bag (Robert Knepper) and Bellick (Wade Williams) are up to their old tricks, but this time they refuse to give up.</p>
        <p>4 P.M. (Discovery Health) RUNWAY MOMS -- It is not uncommon for women to continue working while pregnant, but for models whose bodies are their work, like (from near right) Heather Walker, Maria Feeney and Elina Kalnina, maternity presents unusual challenges. This series follows Expecting Models, which bills itself as the only professional agency specializing in pregnant models, and illustrates what it takes to go from catwalk to delivery room. Tonight a husband rushes to arrive in time for his child's birth.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (ABC Family) LINCOLN HEIGHTS -- In the season finale the Suttons have the opportunity to get out of the neighborhood when they receive an offer on their house, but they have second thoughts when they realize they have grown attached to Lincoln Heights. But Bishop is still at large and looking for revenge, so Eddie (Russell Hornsby) worries for his family's safety.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (TLC) MY LIFE AS A CHILD -- Four girls show what it is like to grow up from their perspective in the final installment of this series of stories made by young people about their own lives.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Discovery) FUTUREWEAPONS -- Unmanned drone planes were once the ''look at that!'' marvel of military science. Coming up next: the Crusher unmanned vehicle. Richard Machowicz, an ex-member of the Navy Seals known as Mack, acts as guide to the present and future of military hardware. Also in this episode: the Active Denial System, a nonlethal ray that makes a person's skin feel as if it were burning.</p>
        <p>9:45 P.M. (ABC) THE BACHELOR: OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN -- A bevy of beauties may be singing ''Love lift us up where we belong,'' as they vie for romance with Lt. Andy Baldwin of the Navy in the premiere of this season's love search. Lieutenant Baldwin is a Duke-educated doctor, a triathlete and a blond-haired, blue-eyed beaut himself. Don't tell your mom about the show; she'll insist you sign up as a contestant.</p>
        <p>10:15 P.M. (Sundance) THE CRUISE -- (1998) Timothy Levitch, a k a Speed, loves New York. A tour bus guide with a lust for nonconformity bordering on the obsessive, Mr. Levitch takes you through a black-and-white version of the only city that moves faster than he talks. He also espouses fiery opinions and deep-seated philosophies with a dizzying bravado in this documentary by Bennett Miller, a best-director Oscar nominee for ''Capote'' (2005).</p>

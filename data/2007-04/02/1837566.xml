        <p>For two months, the high-volume battle over Gov. Eliot Spitzer's cuts to hospitals and nursing homes has obscured a significant piece of his health care plan, a major expansion of state-subsidized health insurance, especially for middle-class children, which sailed with little debate into the state budget approved yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Legislature agreed to Mr. Spitzer's plan to set the nation's highest income ceiling for state-financed health care for children, making it, more than ever, a middle-class entitlement. Child Health Plus, the state-subsidized health insurance plan, was created in the early 1990s for the children of low-income families that were not quite poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, but income limits have risen over the years.</p>
        <p>New York already allows families with incomes up to 250 percent of the federal poverty line -- or $51,630 for a family of four -- to qualify for Child Health Plus by paying a monthly premium of up to $15 per child, depending on income and family size. The new state budget will raise that to 400 percent -- $82,600 for a family of four -- the highest in the country.</p>
        <p>That would make most of the 400,000 uninsured children in New York eligible for the program. The budget would also simplify enrollment in Medicaid, to address the fact that almost 1 million New Yorkers are eligible but not covered.</p>
        <p>No one knows how many people will actually enroll in the programs as a result of the changes, or precisely how much the expansions will cost.</p>
        <p>''These are good steps,'' but not ambitious enough, said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. ''We need to sit down with the governor, roll up our sleeves, and have a serious conversation about how we get to universal.''</p>
        <p>Health care, by far the biggest part of the state's budget, has posed a competing set of challenges for Mr. Spitzer. He wants to lower the health care costs the state already bears, in particular, reining in the nation's most expensive Medicaid program, at $47 billion a year. At the same time, he wants to greatly increase the number of people the state covers. Unless he can do the former, he cannot afford the latter.</p>
        <p>As a candidate last year, and again as governor, Mr. Spitzer said he could achieve universal health coverage in New York. The state has about 2.7 million uninsured people, and covering all of them would cost about $4 billion a year, experts say.</p>
        <p>From the day, two months ago, when he proposed his budget, the governor and his aides insisted that his call to cut spending was not just about saving money and reining in Medicaid. They said that just as important were their attempts to rearrange the money in ways that would make the system simpler, more sensible and fairer -- and less dependent on political deals made with the powerful hospital industry and health workers' union.</p>
        <p>The new governor got much of what he wanted on that score, admittedly small steps that he promised were the first among many in a long process he likened to turning a battleship.</p>
        <p>''The policy objectives I outlined in January, we met,'' Mr. Spitzer said Friday.</p>
        <p>The budget includes more than $900 million of the $1.3 billion in health care spending cuts he sought. But 1199 United Healthcare Workers East, along with the hospital and nursing home industries, were able to beat back more than half the cuts aimed at them, allowing them to claim victory, too.</p>
        <p>''Our hat's off to the governor and Legislature for enacting some significant health care reforms,'' said Jennifer Cunningham, a senior adviser to the union. ''But kudos to New Yorkers and the democratic process for making sure that we didn't achieve these reforms at the expense of our state's top-notch hospitals, nursing homes and health care workers.''</p>
        <p>In proposing his cuts, Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, seemed to be declaring his independence from the health care workers' union and the hospital industry, forces often allied with Democrats that had been accustomed to getting their way in Albany.</p>
        <p>His plans touched off a public relations war, with the union and the hospitals buying millions of dollars worth of television ads criticizing him, and Mr. Spitzer responding with ads of his own.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Spitzer got somewhat less than half the savings he wanted from hospitals and nursing homes, most of what he got involved the kind of restructuring he said was so important.</p>
        <p>The state pays hospitals, through Medicaid and other programs, to train new doctors -- but the payments are based mostly on the number of residents the hospitals taught in 1981, even if that number has since declined. Through Medicaid, the state pays hospitals and nursing homes to help recruit and retain workers -- but it doles out that money based on their overall payrolls, not how many Medicaid patients they actually have.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer tried to eliminate such practices, saying that Medicaid dollars should follow Medicaid patients and teaching dollars should follow students. He got his way on doctor training money and a partial victory on worker recruitment programs, and cut those programs by almost $150 million a year in the process.</p>
        <p>A result is that the budget cuts will hit hospitals very unevenly; some hospitals in poor neighborhoods actually stand to gain money. The precise impacts have not been calculated yet, but an analysis of Mr. Spitzer's January proposals by the Greater New York Hospital Association found that 15 hospitals -- mostly relatively large, financially successful ones in New York City -- would bear most of the cuts.</p>
        <p>The governor declared last week that lawmakers had ''set the budget on a new path,'' acknowledging that the path was a long one.</p>
        <p>But the amounts of money redistributed -- as opposed to simply cut -- were relatively small, compared with the overall health budget. When it comes to rethinking how the money is spent, of far more consequence could be the governor's plan for a top-to-bottom overhaul of what Medicaid pays for each of hundreds of services, from bandaging a cut to removing a cancerous lung.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer had proposed more than $400 million in big, across-the-board cuts to hospitals and nursing homes that were simply about reining in spending, but those were shrunk to about $82 million. For those industries, the budget also includes a number of smaller, more targeted cuts and increases.</p>
        <p>The governor had more success with broad-based cuts, more than $372 million, in part by reducing Medicaid payments to pharmacists for prescription drugs, and by freezing the premiums the state pays to insurance companies that enroll Medicaid patients. The state is also counting on $132 million in savings from improved efforts to fight Medicaid fraud.</p>
        <p>Budget Highlights</p>
        <p>HEALTH CARE -- The Legislature agreed to $1 billion in Medicaid cuts proposed by Gov. Eliot Spitzer, about $350 million less than he had wanted to cut. The budget also calls for the state to allow more adults and children to get and keep Medicaid benefits under a streamlined enrollment process, and to expand a health insurance program for children.</p>
        <p>EDUCATION -- Lawmakers raised a cap on the number of charter schools, to 200, with many of the new ones expected to be established in New York City. Education spending will rise nearly $1.8 billion as part of a compromise to overhaul the state's system of school financing, which critics have long said shortchanges poorer districts. The Legislature agreed to the financing reform but insisted on additional aid for suburban school districts, mostly on Long Island.</p>
        <p>PROPERTY TAXES -- The governor and the Legislature agreed to give $1.3 million in tax rebates directly to property owners this year.</p>
        <p>STEM CELL FUND -- The Legislature voted to spend $100 million for stem cell research.</p>

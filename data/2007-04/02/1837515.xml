        <p>In the 13th century a Malian king, Sundiata, consolidated the Mandinka empire across a swath of West Africa, from what is now Mauritania to the Ivory Coast, and from Senegal to Nigeria. Toumani Diabate's Symmetric Orchestra, which played a deep-rooted, tradition-stretching and utterly kinetic concert on Friday night at Zankel Hall, recreates that empire as a modern musical coalition. Age-old patterns and modal melodies rocketed through the songs as Soumaila Kanoute or Mamadou Kouyate sang about topics ranging from love to the desertification of West Africa and the exploitation of African resources. Social commentary met dazzling virtuosity.</p>
        <p>The group's 10 musicians come from across the old empire. Three each share the last names of ancient djeli (or griot) families, Diabate and Kouyate, but were born in different modern countries. The lyrics were in several West African languages, and the lineup paired African instruments -- the kora (the djelis' 21-string harp-lute), the xylophonelike balafon, the small banjolike ngoni and the booming djembe (hand drum) -- with modern counterparts: electric guitar, bass, keyboard and trap drums. The rhythms drew on traditions from djeli songs to salsa, which transplanted African rhythms and dances into the Americas.</p>

        <p>In the 13th century a Malian king, Sundiata, consolidated the Mandinka empire across a swath of West Africa, from what is now Mauritania to the Ivory Coast, and from Senegal to Nigeria. Toumani Diabate's Symmetric Orchestra, which played a deep-rooted, tradition-stretching and utterly kinetic concert on Friday night at Zankel Hall, recreates that empire as a modern musical coalition. Age-old patterns and modal melodies rocketed through the songs as Soumaila Kanoute or Mamadou Kouyate sang about topics ranging from love to the desertification of West Africa and the exploitation of African resources. Social commentary met dazzling virtuosity.</p>
        <p>The group's 10 musicians come from across the old empire. Three each share the last names of ancient djeli (or griot) families, Diabate and Kouyate, but were born in different modern countries. The lyrics were in several West African languages, and the lineup paired African instruments -- the kora (the djelis' 21-string harp-lute), the xylophonelike balafon, the small banjolike ngoni and the booming djembe (hand drum) -- with modern counterparts: electric guitar, bass, keyboard and trap drums. The rhythms drew on traditions from djeli songs to salsa, which transplanted African rhythms and dances into the Americas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diabate is from a celebrated djeli family, and he plays the kora, though he was not one of his father's students. The kora has traditionally accompanied singers, but Mr. Diabate also makes it a lead instrument, placing its mathematical patterns and darting improvisations in the foreground. In one song on Friday night he demonstrated how he picks three parts at once: bass line, melody and improvisations above them both.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diabate has widely collaborated inside and outside Mali: with the bluesman Taj Mahal, the flamenco group Ketama and, on her next album, Bjork. His album with the Malian guitarist Ali Farka Toure, ''In the Heart of the Moon'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch), won a Grammy Award. But the tone of that music was meditative, while the Symmetric Orchestra is a dance band that has been playing weekly shows in Bamako, Mali's capital, for 15 years.</p>
        <p>Its music rides on the intricacies of West African rhythm -- shifting, multilayered three-against-two syncopations -- and on galvanizing dynamics that called for a dance floor rather than Zankel Hall. Mr. Diabate on kora, Fode Lassana Diabate on balafon and Fanta Mady Kouyate on electric guitar traded lines at hyperspeed in startling buildups, and the singers worked up to the rapid, oratorical flourishes of djeli singing, sometimes getting on their knees to praise Mr. Diabate and call for more kora.</p>
        <p>Improvisations showed the Symmetric Orchestra's familiarity with jazz, salsa and funk. But the music wasn't aiming at some diluted international crossover; it was welcoming distant relations back to the Mandinka empire, and there was no compromising its African core.</p>

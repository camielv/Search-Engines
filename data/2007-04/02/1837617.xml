        <p>A 29-year-old man was charged with assault in the stabbing of another man outside a Williamsburg restaurant yesterday morning, the police said. The man then fled the scene, right, and tried to blend in with several homeless people to avoid detection, witnesses said. The stabbing occurred shortly before 9 a.m. outside Las Palmera de Mi Pueblo, a restaurant and bar at 347 Broadway near Keap Street. Witnesses said the suspect, Pedro Torres, had been hanging out under the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway before the stabbing, then left and returned about an hour later, followed by the police. ''They caught the dude over there, where we were standing,'' said James Cone, 53, who is homeless. ''We have a crate where we sit. He tried to sit there and hide.'' The victim, whose name was not released, was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center and was in critical condition, the police said.</p>

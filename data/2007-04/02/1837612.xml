        <p>This would have seemed impossible three months ago, Rutgers having a chance to win the women's N.C.A.A. basketball championship. After a sputtering start, the Scarlet Knights lost access to their locker room, to their university-issued practice gear and, apparently, to any chance of winning a national title.</p>
        <p>C. Vivian Stringer, an operatically frustrated coach, even took away her players' laundry privileges for a month and refused to wear the team colors after Rutgers opened the season 2-4, struggling to score and failing to meet Stringer's rigorous standards on defense.</p>
        <p>Yet a young team coalesced and persevered, and with a 59-35 rout of Louisiana State on Sunday night in the national semifinals, the Scarlet Knights have achieved something Stringer thought was inconceivable early in the season.</p>
        <p>As usual, Rutgers prevailed Sunday with strangling defense. The centers, Kia Vaughn and Rashidat Junaid, used their hips and elbows and muscled L.S.U.'s more celebrated post player, Sylvia Fowles, into irrelevance. Fowles finished with 5 points, missing 8 of her 10 shots.</p>
        <p>Over all, L.S.U. shot a meager 14 for 53 (26.4 percent) and scored the fewest points in a Final Four game. The Scarlet Knights hit eight 3-pointers in the first half to build an intractable 37-19 lead. Guard Matee Ajavon scored 16 points and forward Essence Carson added 15 before leaving the game with a leg cramp.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, against Tennessee, a 56-50 winner against North Carolina later on Sunday, Rutgers (27-8) will seek its first N.C.A.A. championship in any sport since 1949. The Scarlet Knights did win the 1982 women's basketball championship in the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, now defunct.</p>
        <p>''Nobody expected us to be here,'' Stringer said, adding, ''The players believed in themselves.''</p>
        <p>Stringer is the only coach to lead three programs to the Final Four -- Cheyney State in 1982, Iowa in 1993 and Rutgers in 2000 and 2007. She may also be the only coach to impose such harsh measures on her players during a season.</p>
        <p>Some of the Scarlet Knights were assigned to read the novel ''Wicked,'' based on the ''Wizard of Oz,'' to determine which of them needed more heart and courage.</p>
        <p>But Stringer's drastic actions paid off as L.S.U. lost for the fourth consecutive year in the national semifinals. A tumultuous month came to an end after Coach Pokey Chatman resigned amid allegations by an assistant that she had behaved improperly with more than one former L.S.U. player.</p>
        <p>A central matchup Sunday occurred in the post between the 6-foot-6 Fowles and the 6-4 Vaughn. Fowles, a junior, had scored 23 points, grabbed 15 rebounds and blocked 6 shots in the final of the Fresno Regional as the Lady Tigers routed Connecticut, 73-50.</p>
        <p>''A one-man wrecking crew,'' Stringer called the mobile Fowles, saying that she probably ''could play on the vast majority of Division I men's basketball teams.''</p>
        <p>Tina Charles, UConn's freshman center, was incapable of guarding Fowles and scored only 1 point against her. Vaughn, a sophomore, is stronger and more experienced than Charles. She has worked her way into basketball shape by losing 25 to 30 pounds since arriving at Rutgers, enabling her to move faster and feel more confident.</p>
        <p>Stringer joked beforehand of Fowles and L.S.U. that ''they should watch her food and make sure she doesn't get sick.''</p>
        <p>More seriously, Stringer said that it would take a collective effort to prevail, adding: ''We do need to protect Kia Vaughn. It poses a problem, no question.''</p>
        <p>From the opening tip, Vaughn began to push and shove Fowles as if trying to get a soda out of a balky vending machine. Rutgers dropped guards inside to help, surrounding Fowles in a thicket of arms. The plan worked as Fowles hit an early jump hook, then began to play awkwardly, missing several times inside, losing the ball and, seemingly, her assertiveness.</p>
        <p>''I tried to be tough with her,'' Vaughn said. ''She has a strong body. I tried to move her around and keep her as far away from the basket as I possibly could.''</p>
        <p>With 11 minutes 16 seconds left in the first half, though, Vaughn undercut Fowles, drawing her second foul, and headed to the bench until intermission. This might have left Rutgers vulnerable, but not Sunday. Junaid, a 6-4 freshman, kept strong-arming Fowles, who managed no points and only one shot after Vaughn left the game.</p>
        <p>By halftime, Fowles had accounted for 2 points and 4 turnovers as Rutgers drew ahead by 18 points. Vaughn drew her third foul five minutes into the second half, but she responded with 8 points, keeping the Scarlet Knights comfortably ahead.</p>
        <p>Long forgotten was the exasperation of November and December, when Stringer threw her team out of its locker room, forcing players to dress in the hallways and bathrooms of the Louis Brown Athletic Center.</p>
        <p>Players were left to do their own laundry and to use practice gear and sneakers from high school or A.A.U. teams. After about a month, the sanctions were finally rescinded. And the Scarlet Knights have won 13 of their past 14 games.</p>
        <p>''I think all of us made up our minds that we've got to have a good season, that we've got to make something of it,'' Ajavon said.</p>

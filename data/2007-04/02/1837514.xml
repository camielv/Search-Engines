        <p>''Colors of Rajasthan'' was what the World Music Institute called the program of Indian folk music and dance that it presented on Friday night at Symphony Space. But its star performer, a Gypsy dancer known in India as Gulabo, had the right idea. For her it was simply ''Gulabi Sapera &amp; Party.'' The evening was indeed an ebullient, even raucous party of the sort that might occur at village weddings in the Great Thar Desert area of Rajasthan, in northwest India, where the company originated. Without the relatively restrained and subtler contributions of the troupe's musicians, the enterprise could well have gotten out of hand.</p>
        <p>Gulabi, who has been performing throughout India, Europe and North America for more than 20 years, is the daughter of a snake charmer and a member of the Kalbeliya Sapera tribe of snake wranglers. Her given name means rose, and in one solo she suggested a delicate love story. But her popular name, Gulabo, means ''influential and powerful,'' and ''Mayuri dance,'' which she choreographed and performed, looked more like a dance for an endearing tough-cookie bazaar vendor than the female peacock she was impersonating or the sad separated lovers to which the music alluded.</p>

        <p>''Colors of Rajasthan'' was what the World Music Institute called the program of Indian folk music and dance that it presented on Friday night at Symphony Space. But its star performer, a Gypsy dancer known in India as Gulabo, had the right idea. For her it was simply ''Gulabi Sapera &amp; Party.'' The evening was indeed an ebullient, even raucous party of the sort that might occur at village weddings in the Great Thar Desert area of Rajasthan, in northwest India, where the company originated. Without the relatively restrained and subtler contributions of the troupe's musicians, the enterprise could well have gotten out of hand.</p>
        <p>Gulabi, who has been performing throughout India, Europe and North America for more than 20 years, is the daughter of a snake charmer and a member of the Kalbeliya Sapera tribe of snake wranglers. Her given name means rose, and in one solo she suggested a delicate love story. But her popular name, Gulabo, means ''influential and powerful,'' and ''Mayuri dance,'' which she choreographed and performed, looked more like a dance for an endearing tough-cookie bazaar vendor than the female peacock she was impersonating or the sad separated lovers to which the music alluded.</p>
        <p>What all the pieces so far for her and the company's female dancers had in common was fascinating, physically and rhythmically complex movement for the upper body as the women spun and circled the stage, carrying pots on their heads in the welcoming ''Chari'' number, and often tilting right onto the floor. Arms branched out and retreated, snakelike, with snapping, twisting wrists, with the women dressed in vivid-colored saris with just enough glitter trim.</p>
        <p>Dinesh Kumar, Gulabi's son and one of many relatives in a troupe that is essentially an extended dance family, was a young charmer who expertly circled the stage on his knees. Habib Khan Langa nearly stole the show in extroverted solos on the wooden blocks, and Sarwan Nath, the small, stooping pungi (double clarinet) soloist, was clearly a closet dancer. A solo by Ramakishan Nagarchi on the nagara (kettledrum) was another highlight of the show.</p>
        <p>DANCE REVIEW</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 14, 2007, Saturday  A dance review on April 2 about ''Colors of Rajasthan'' at Symphony Space in Manhattan, citing information in the program, misidentified the musician who played the wooden blocks. He was Bhawroo Khan Langa, not Habib Khan Langa. (Habib Khan Langa played the bowed lute and double flute.)</p>

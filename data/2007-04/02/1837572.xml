        <p>Tim McGraw  Let It Go (Curb)</p>
        <p>Last year the rookie country singer Taylor Swift had a breakthrough hit with ''Tim McGraw.'' Maybe it's a coincidence, but Mr. McGraw's ninth album, ''Let It Go,'' includes a song called, ''Kristofferson.''</p>
        <p>It's a complicated act of meta-balladry, a song about songwriting sung by a guy who didn't write it: ''I'm gonna tell you how I feel, straight-up genuine and real/Open a bottle of 90 proof and write a song for you/Like Kristofferson would do.'' (Once Kris Kristofferson records a wry love song called ''Hank Williams,'' this game is over.)</p>
        <p>''Let It Go'' has already spawned a hit, ''Last Dollar (Fly Away),'' an exuberant (and halfway nonsensical) love song written by Big Kenny of the duo Big &amp; Rich. Elsewhere on this solid but sometimes clumsy CD handsome laments (the old-fashioned ''Whiskey and You'') alternate with overheated experiments (there's a ludicrous murder ballad, ''Between the River and Me'') and a few surprises, like ''Suspicions,'' a five-minute blues-rock song about a man who feels insecure because his woman is ''just so good-lookin'.''</p>
        <p>Speaking of which, nothing here touches ''I Need You,'' a gorgeous duet featuring Mr. McGraw's wife, Faith Hill. Two of country's biggest stars, calmly explaining that they're desperate for each other: no telling whether it's ''genuine and real,'' but it works every time.</p>

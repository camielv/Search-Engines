        <p>Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, was overwhelmingly re-elected to a three-year term. The union, which represents 70,000 New York City public school teachers and 17,000 classroom paraprofessionals, announced on Friday that Ms. Weingarten had received 40,665 votes, or 87 percent of those cast, while her opponent, Kit Wainer, received 6,070. This will be Ms. Weingarten's fourth full term. In 1998, she was appointed to fill the remainder of Sandra Feldman's term, after Ms. Feldman ascended to become president of the parent union, the American Federation of Teachers.</p>

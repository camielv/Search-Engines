        <p>In 2006, the number of households with PCs that downloaded at least one song using free peer-to-peer software, like Limewire or BitTorrent, grew a modest 7.2 percent, reaching 14.9 million, according to figures released by the NPD Group, a market-research firm.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the number of PC households that used royalty-paying services like iTunes Store shot up 65.8 percent to 12.6 million, meaning such services could soon become the most widely used method of downloading music.</p>

        <p>In 2006, the number of households with PCs that downloaded at least one song using free peer-to-peer software, like Limewire or BitTorrent, grew a modest 7.2 percent, reaching 14.9 million, according to figures released by the NPD Group, a market-research firm.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the number of PC households that used royalty-paying services like iTunes Store shot up 65.8 percent to 12.6 million, meaning such services could soon become the most widely used method of downloading music.</p>
        <p>But the average peer-to-peer household still downloads far more songs. Peer-to-peer networks yielded five billion downloads in 2006, whereas 509 million songs were downloaded from iTunes-style services.</p>
        <p>The explanation may be, quite simply, that free downloads are easier to gorge on than downloads you have to pay for. But there are other reasons peer-to-peer users download so many songs, said Russ Crupnick, an analyst with NPD. Among them is the declining price and increasing size of hard drives. ''When I talk to people who are involved in a lot of peer to peer, they're running around with external hard drives,'' he said.</p>
        <p>NPD gathered its data from tracking software installed on 12,000 home PCs. The data was adjusted to reflect the Internet-using population, and then extrapolated to the roughly 70 million Internet-using households in the United States.</p>

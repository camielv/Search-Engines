        <p>The Ohio State assistant Dan Peters and the Florida assistant Larry Shyatt break down the game from their perspective while other coaches weigh in.</p>
        <p>By PETE THAMEL</p>
        <p>LARRY SHYATT  Florida assistant  Their center is very healthy now, which he was not in December. With young players that they're playing, they're far more experienced after going through one of the best schedules in the country.</p>
        <p>When you're at the level these two teams are in terms of the talent and coaching ability, it's difficult to change a great deal at the end of the road because you've had so much success and the players have done so well up to that point. They're one of the most up-tempo teams that we played all year. I think our guys are comfortable with that pace.</p>
        <p>DAN PETERS  Ohio State assistant  Unfortunately, the officials have a lot to do with the game sometimes. You hope their players adjust quick enough to how they're going to call it. It hurts having officials who don't know how to officiate big guys. Maybe I'm wrong about this, but because kids in the last 10 years in college could leave high school to the N.B.A., you didn't have a lot of big guys. I think most officials know that people come to see the kids play.</p>
        <p>I told Thad: ''Why don't we walk up to the officials and ask what five minutes is Greg going to play in the first half? The beginning? The middle? Or the end?'' It's hard. That guy wants to play.</p>
        <p>MATT PAINTER  Purdue played Ohio State three times this season and Florida in the second round of the N.C.A.A. tournament. Here is Purdue Coach Matt Painter's take on how the teams match up.</p>
        <p>It's going to be very important for Ohio State to keep Florida out of transition. I think that Florida has five guys that really push the ball up the floor. They're like piranhas when you take a bad shot, have a long rebound or turn the ball over.</p>
        <p>Taurean Green and Lee Humphrey feed off the inside-outside game, but they also get a lot of 3s in transition.</p>
        <p>I would say that Ohio State will try and play this game much more in the halfcourt than the first game because they're going to wait on Greg Oden. They're going to want to wait on their horse.</p>
        <p>JAY PRICE  The Illinois assistant Jay Price saw Ohio State play many times in the Big Ten this season and offered these thoughts on the matchup.</p>
        <p>It's unbelievable how much better Oden has gotten since the first time these two teams played. He was out of shape and one-handed. He couldn't run up and down the court and was just getting his legs. There's no question that Ohio State is a much better team since it lost at Florida in December.</p>
        <p>It would not surprise me if Ohio State opened up in a zone. I think they'll mix it up. I thought they did a good job of getting Georgetown off balance with changing defenses.</p>
        <p>MIKE JONES  Georgia played Florida three times this season, and the assistant Mike Jones offered this scouting report on tonight's game.</p>
        <p>Ohio State really tried to go up-tempo and play fast the first time around. It worked for a little while. It was a pretty close game in the first half, but they ended up losing by around 30. Ohio State will need to play like U.C.L.A. did in the first 10 minutes to have a better chance. It's got to be a brutal, grind-it-out kind of game.</p>

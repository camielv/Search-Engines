        <p>Forgive the generalization, but there is simply no time period more accommodating to the historical documentary form than the first four decades of the last century. Photography, sound recording and film were all becoming established, but the technology was still ragged enough that the history looks like history, rather than like last week's news. Documentaries made of such stuff, with their fluttery video and tentative audio, let you feel the emergence of the modern era.</p>
        <p>The makers of ''Sister Aimee,'' tonight's installment of ''American Experience'' on PBS, make this work for them perfectly in telling the irresistible story of the evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. Early on, re-enactments, still photographs and a weird sort of hologram conjure McPherson, but as her career advances we see the real barnstormer in action -- and then we see her almost eaten alive by the mass media. It feels like the career trajectory of practically everyone who has become even moderately famous in the last hundred years.</p>

        <p>Forgive the generalization, but there is simply no time period more accommodating to the historical documentary form than the first four decades of the last century.

        <p>The makers of ''Sister Aimee,'' tonight's installment of ''American Experience'' on PBS, make this work for them perfectly in telling the irresistible story of the evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. Early on, re-enactments, still photographs and a weird sort of hologram conjure McPherson, but as her career advances we see the real barnstormer in action -- and then we see her almost eaten alive by the mass media. It feels like the career trajectory of practically everyone who has become even moderately famous in the last hundred years.</p>
        <p>Aimee Kennedy (the Semple and McPherson were the gifts of two husbands, neither of whom lasted long) got started on the path to religious celebrity in 1907 when, at 17, she attended a revival service near her home in Canada. ''Aimee went because it was entertainment,'' says Anthea Butler, one of several engaging historians who provide commentary. ''They didn't have television. What if you had people down the street who seemed to be barking like dogs and rolling around on the floor? Who wouldn't go? And it's free.''</p>
        <p>By 1915, now living in the United States, McPherson had begun preaching, and soon she became a sensation. ''I know a lot of you folks came to gape at a woman preacher,'' she once said. ''But while your mouth is open to gape, I'll pop the gospel in.''</p>
        <p>On New Year's Day 1923 she opened the huge Angelus Temple in Los Angeles. Also around this time, concerned about the teaching of evolution, she began to look for opportunities to influence politics. And then, in 1926, came one of the juiciest stories of the age: She disappeared while swimming off the California coast. Did she drown? Run off with a married man? When she emerged weeks later, saying she had been kidnapped, the press really went crazy. She never completely regained her influence, but she still had a following when she died in 1944.</p>
        <p>McPherson's tale has all sorts of connections to today: the blending of religion and entertainment; the mixing of religion and politics. But Linda Garmon, who wrote and directed the film (based on Matthew Avery Sutton's book ''Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America''), wisely doesn't belabor them. She seems more interested in McPherson as an early example of someone who lost control of her own fame. The historian Stephen Prothero sums it up nicely. ''Nowadays celebrities do have some sense of what they're getting in for,'' he says. ''In the '20s that wasn't necessarily the case. These people who were moving into celebrity -- the Mary Pickfords in film, the Babe Ruths in sports, the Aimee Semple McPhersons in religion -- they didn't know really what the rules were going to be.''</p>

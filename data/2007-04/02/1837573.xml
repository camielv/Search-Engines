        <p>Hilary Duff  Dignity (Hollywood)</p>
        <p>Hilary Duff is 19, and she is responsible for some of the best teen-pop songs of the past few years (''Wake Up'' evoked the spirit of the Go-Gos), along with some of the worst (for starters: ''Cry,'' an excruciating ballad). Her new album, ''Dignity,'' sounds a lot like a break-up album; as her young fans know, she recently split with Joel Madden, from the pop-punk band Good Charlotte. The album's first words are, ''Nobody believes me when I tell 'em that you're outta your mind.''</p>

        <p>Hilary Duff  Dignity (Hollywood)</p>
        <p>Hilary Duff is 19, and she is responsible for some of the best teen-pop songs of the past few years (''Wake Up'' evoked the spirit of the Go-Gos), along with some of the worst (for starters: ''Cry,'' an excruciating ballad). Her new album, ''Dignity,'' sounds a lot like a break-up album; as her young fans know, she recently split with Joel Madden, from the pop-punk band Good Charlotte. The album's first words are, ''Nobody believes me when I tell 'em that you're outta your mind.''</p>
        <p>Endowed with a voice that might charitably be described as adequate, Ms. Duff has good reason to keep the tempos brisk, the beats sharp, the music buzzy. The result is a pretty strong album of electro-pop; listeners who have never heard of Lizzie McGuire (Ms. Duff's Disney Channel alter ego) might be pleasantly surprised.</p>
        <p>The current single is ''With Love,'' a tart dance track; ''Never Stop'' is a fizzy love song that literally skips a beat; ''Between You and Me'' is a shameless exercise in No Doubt-ology. And don't be fooled by the playful sound of ''Dreamer'': It's actually a spooky song about a stalker, sung by a star who has famously been stalked. ''Your eyes must burn so bad, 'cause you haven't blinked,'' she sings, and you can hear a shudder of fear beneath the taunt.</p>

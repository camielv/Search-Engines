        <p>An article in Business Day on March 21 about the influx of logic games and brainteasers misstated the role of Nikoli Publishing in the publication of its sudoku books and calendars in the United States. Nikoli served as the editor, not the co-publisher. (Workman Publishing is the publisher.) The article also misidentified the first newspaper in the United States that published a sudoku puzzle by Wayne Gould, who helped popularize the brainteaser. It was The Conway Daily Sun in New Hampshire in 2004, not The New York Post in 2005.</p>

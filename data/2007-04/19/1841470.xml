        <p>About one in four men in New York City reported binge drinking in a survey that was released yesterday by the city health department. The survey, which gathered information from 10,000 New Yorkers by telephone, was based on 2005 data, the most recent that was available, city officials said. They said the rate of binge drinking -- defined as having five or more drinks on one occasion in the past month -- was unchanged since 2002. Over all, 14 percent of adult city residents reported binge drinking, lower than the national rate of 24 percent of adults, city officials said. The survey showed that men reported binge drinking three times more frequently than women.</p>

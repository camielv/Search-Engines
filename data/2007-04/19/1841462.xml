        <p>About 8,000 demonstrators gathered near President Kurmanbek Bakiev's office in Bishkek, the capital, for an eighth day of protests against him, and added a call for new parliamentary elections to their list of demands for sweeping government reforms. They have already demanded new presidential elections. Mr. Bakiev has initiated a number of compromises with the opposition in recent weeks, including appointing a critic as prime minister. Protest leaders are calling for larger demonstrations over the weekend.</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 20, 2007, Friday  The headline on a report in the World Briefing column yesterday about opposition protests referred incorrectly in some copies to the country where the protests took place. They were in Kyrgyzstan, not Kazakhstan.</p>

        <p>Now that the women's college basketball season has ended, many coaches are on the road recruiting through mid-May.

        <p>Now that the women's college basketball season has ended, many coaches are on the road recruiting through mid-May. And, some said in recent interviews, they could face fallout from last month's resignation of Pokey Chatman from Louisiana State, following charges of what the university described yesterday for the first time as inappropriate sexual relationships between her and former players.</p>
        <p>''This is everyone's worst nightmare,'' Mary Jo Kane, director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls and Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota, said during widespread discussion of the Chatman case during the N.C.A.A. tournament.</p>
        <p>At its heart, L.S.U. officials said, the Chatman case is about abuse of trust or power. Yet some coaches, administrators and academics say they fear that the accusations against Chatman will inflame homophobia; reinforce stereotypes of lesbians as sexual predators; lead to more so-called negative recruiting, or attempts to steer players away from coaches suspected of being gay; increase skepticism toward the hiring of single women as head coaches; and scare the parents of potential recruits.</p>
        <p>''I think there are coaches who may try to use this against any female coaches who are not married and just make innuendo, to put fear in some players' minds or parents' minds,'' said Gail Goestenkors, the former Duke coach who moved this month to the University of Texas. ''That happens sometimes now anyway. I think that will fuel the fire a little bit.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, in a telephone interview, Raymond Lamonica, L.S.U.'s general counsel, said that charges levied by a former assistant coach against Chatman were sexual in nature. He first made similar remarks in Wednesday's editions of The Advocate, the daily newspaper in Baton Rouge, La. The university had previously said only that Chatman had inappropriate relationships with more than one former player.</p>
        <p>Recruiters tell parents, ''We're going to take care of your girl or boy,'' Lamonica said. ''The notion that anyone in a supervisory capacity, academic or sports, could have a sexual relationship with that person is outrageous.''</p>
        <p>Chatman, who resigned on March 7, has declined to comment, but is seeking $800,000 from L.S.U., an amount covering the final two years of her contract.</p>
        <p>Chatman's lawyer, Mary Olive Pierson, called the sexual charges ''unsubstantiated hearsay'' in a telephone interview yesterday. She also said that L.S.U. had no written policy governing relationships between teachers and students, and between coaches and athletes.</p>
        <p>''I don't know that you can say something is inappropriate when no rule makes it so,'' Pierson said.</p>
        <p>Lamonica said that rules governing a coach's behavior were clearly written in Chatman's contract, which called for her to comport herself in accordance with ''high moral, ethical and academic standards of the athletic department and the university.''</p>
        <p>The most immediate impact of the Chatman case, some coaches said during the N.C.A.A. tournament, may be an increase in negative recruiting. Coaches and administrators disagree on how widespread the role of suspected lesbianism plays in pitting one university against another, but many agree the practice exists in a manner that can be subtle and overt.</p>
        <p>Wes Moore, the coach at Tennessee-Chattanooga, said that he considered women's college basketball as ''family entertainment'' that should uphold ''family values.''</p>
        <p>At some universities, media guides portray female players both in their uniforms and in dress clothes, implying they can be both athletic and feminine.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, coaches say, sexual orientation becomes a blunt tool in recruiting, with a rival coach saying to a prospective player or her parents: ''You don't want to go to this school because the coach is a lesbian or there are lesbians on the team.''</p>
        <p>A coach who is described as being a lesbian becomes almost defenseless in confronting such claims, left with the choice of denying it or saying, ''I am but I won't bother your daughter,'' said Linda Carpenter, emeritus professor of physical education at Brooklyn College who has studied the participation of women in sports for three decades.</p>
        <p>''It gives fodder to people looking for a reason to carve out an area where women need not apply,'' Carpenter said.</p>
        <p>Yet, negative recruiting carries the risk of backfiring, said Geno Auriemma, who has won five national titles coaching at Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''What if the kid you're recruiting is gay and you don't know it?'' Auriemma said. ''You bring the topic up and the kid says, 'I'm not playing for this guy; this guy's got problems.' ''</p>
        <p>He added, ''Coaches who do care about that stuff lose.''</p>
        <p>Kane, the sports sociologist at Minnesota, said she once heard a female coach say that the best coaching qualifications for a woman are to be divorced with no children. This ostensibly establishes her heterosexuality while leaving her free to hit the road on recruiting trips.</p>
        <p>Chatman has been replaced at L.S.U. by Van Chancellor. This is a sensitive subject at a time of a declining rate of women's teams being coached by women. When the gender-equity law Title IX was passed in 1972, more than 90 percent of the head coaches of women's teams in all university sports were women, according to a study conducted by Carpenter and Vivian Acosta. By 2006, 42.4 percent of women's college teams were coached by women.</p>
        <p>In Division I women's basketball, 230 of the 332 teams -- 69.3 percent -- were coached by women in 2006, Carpenter said. In 1992, that percentage was 72.2 percent.</p>
        <p>Part of the erosion over the past three decades can be explained by increased opportunities for women and higher-paying jobs in other fields, Carpenter said. But some women's coaches and administrators fear that incidents such as Chatman's could help hasten that decline.</p>
        <p>Some also say that a perceived double standard exists regarding female coaches accused of improper conduct with female athletes. Nora Lynn Finch, the senior associate athletic director at North Carolina State, said, ''My experience is that there have been more issues with male coaches and male staff than female coaches and staff.''</p>
        <p>Yet, Finch said, improper behavior involving female coaches and athletes is ''more controversial by its nature'' and more titillating to talk about.</p>
        <p>''I think there needs to be an opportunity for women to coach women,'' Finch said. ''I hate to see people that are anti-Title IX -- and there's a lot of that sentiment -- say, 'Here's another way we can take down women in sports.' '' A regrettable aspect of the L.S.U. case was that it would likely reinforce the stereotype of lesbians as sexual threats, said Pat Griffin, professor emeritus of social justice at the University of Massachusetts and author of the book ''Strong Women, Deep Closets: Lesbians and Homophobia in Sports.'' Her own research, Griffin said, indicated that the ''vast majority'' of lesbian coaches were ''very scrupulous'' about their treatment of players. ''They know how unfounded accusations can ruin careers,'' Griffin said.</p>
        <p>The issue of sexual orientation sometimes is raised by parents during recruiting visits, coaches say. Goestenkors said that the mother of Kelley Cain, a 6-foot-5 center from Atlanta who has since committed to Tennessee, asked her, ''If there are homosexuals on your team, what is your policy?''</p>
        <p>Goestenkors said she replied, ''I treat everyone the same.''</p>
        <p>Meghan Gardler, a freshman at Connecticut from suburban Philadelphia, said she was admonished by relatives while choosing a university to ''be careful,'' and warned that inappropriate behavior by male and female coaches was ''all around.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, Gardler said, the issue of lesbianism ''was not that big of a deal.''</p>
        <p>This reflects a growing ease by younger athletes, said Griffin. ''They have different attitudes than their coaches.'' she said. The resignation of Coach Rene Portland from Penn State last month may also signal that those who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation could face a loss of top-quality recruits and a loss of their jobs, Kane said.</p>
        <p>Portland resigned weeks after settling a lawsuit filed by a former player who accused her of banning lesbians from her team. Previously, Portland was fined by the university and ordered to take diversity training.</p>
        <p>''There are still going to be prejudices,'' Auriemma said. ''People are just going to be smart enough not to be overt about it.''</p>
        <p>But, Auriemma added that he did not think the Chatman case would prevent female coaches from getting pre-eminent jobs. Goestenkors has since gone to Texas and Joanne P. McCallie has moved from Michigan State to replace Goestenkors at Duke.</p>
        <p>During the N.C.A.A tournament, an athletic director from an unnamed university called and asked for coaching candidates, Auriemma said. He supplied the names of three or four single women, Auriemma said, and the Chatman matter ''never came up.''</p>

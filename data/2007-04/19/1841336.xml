        <p>It's no longer an indulgence for consumers to have vast amounts of digital storage. With camcorders featuring hard drives of 30 gigabytes or more, and MP3 players surpassing that, the hard drives on computers may not be big enough to handle the onslaught.</p>
        <p>External U.S.B. drives are one answer, and their capacities keep growing exponentially.</p>
        <p>The latest offerings from SimpleTech (www.simpletech.com) have raised the bar in storage and lowered it for price. Its SimpleDrive Pininfarina line, designed by the noted Italian automotive design company, is color coded by capacity: 160 gigabytes ($160) in fire red, for example, or 500 gigabytes ($200) in onyx. Comparable drives are $50 to $100 more. SimpleTech has announced that in May it will have models that have capacities of 750 gigabytes and a full terabyte.</p>
        <p>The drives are bundled with ArcSoft's backup and recovery software. SimpleTech was recently acquired by Fabrik, an online storage company, and each drive comes with two gigabytes of free online storage. More space can be purchased with a subscription to Fabrik's storage services.</p>

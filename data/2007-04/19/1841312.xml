        <p>In this group of new releases the question of the moment seems to be: What if? What if cavemen started showing up in the backyards of a surburban subdivision? (''Twin Study'' by Stacey Richter.) Or if a billionaire sheik decided to introduce salmon to a Yemeni river? (Paul Torday's ''Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.'') Answers to those questions, and others, can be found in these recently published books.</p>
        <p>Twin Study  Stories  By Stacey Richter  261 pages. Counterpoint. $24.</p>
        <p>Many characters in Ms. Richter's second collection of stories are outsiders. A Jewish woman with a taste for sinsemilla moves into a community called Yuletide Village, where Christmas is a three-week festival of lights and caroling. (''Caroling, the most odious of verbs.'') A pair of sisters, ardent fans of Joan Jett and Chrissie Hynde, are left more or less to raise themselves in the conformist culture of Utah. And of course there are the cavemen, who've come through a time portal in a condemned Pizza Hut. In addition to a sense of disconnection, Ms. Richter's people tend to share smart mouths and cranky states of mind. As the pot-loving narrator of ''Christ, Their Lord'' notes: ''Something happens to people's brains in the Sun Belt. I believe the constant overload of vitamin D has softened my skull and turned me nice, so that I've started to act like a nice person -- though maybe with a little more of it, I will overdose and just come into my own nastiness.''</p>
        <p>The Back Nine  By Billy Mott  245 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.</p>
        <p>''You here to loop?'' is the first question asked of Charlie MacLeod when he wanders onto a Northern California golf course one morning. (To loop, in the jargon of golf, is to caddy.) And as it turns out, he is. Charlie, a former golf phenom who was injured in high school, has been on the run from his failed marriage in Pittsburgh. In California he finds his swing -- and his life -- again. Sitting on the bench in the caddy shack, ''his worry slowly began to peel away, like the strips of bark from the giant trees, and for the first time in a long while he imagined that someday he might just leave it behind for good.'' But a player of his talent can't stay in the shack of course, and the book culminates in a cinematic showdown on the greens between Charlie and Larry Siegal, a Los Angeles hotshot backed by a man known as the Czar.</p>
        <p>The Unnatural History of Cypress Parish  By Elise Blackwell  210 pages. Unbridled Books. $23.95.</p>
        <p>Set on the eve of Hurricane Katrina's destructive landfall in New Orleans, Elise Blackwell's second novel looks back to the flood of 1927 (a real event) in the (fictional) Cypress Parish, childhood home of Louis Proby. Louis's father is town superintendent for a lumber company, and he keeps order with a mixture of benevolence and violence. From the vantage point of old age, Louis looks back on the choices he made in ''the strange and wet spring I turned 17 and crossed the marshy border that separates all that is good and bad of boyhood from all that is good and bad of manhood.'' As the water rises in the Mississippi, Louis falls in love, accompanies his father on business and becomes the driver for the dissolute lumber company representative, Charles Segrist. Louis's mother gets to the bottom of the matter when another character comments that ''so far it's just backwater flooding.'' She replies, ''I suppose there's nothing just about backwater flooding if you live on backwater.''</p>
        <p>Salmon Fishing in the Yemen  By Paul Torday  333 pages. Harcourt. $24.</p>
        <p>When the fisheries scientist Alfred Jones is first asked to investigate the possibility of introducing salmon, and the sport of salmon fishing, to Yemen, he dismisses the matter out of hand. The problems, he notes, are fairly fundamental. ''First, water,'' he says. ''Salmon are fish. Fish need water.'' But the persuasive power of politics, money and the beautiful Harriet Chetwode-Talbot are brought to bear upon him, and soon Dr. Jones is lending his services to Sheik Muhammad ibn Zaidi bani Tihama, a Yemeni billionaire and dedicated angler, in his attempt to stock the Wadi Aleyn with fish. The book is told through e-mail messages, diary entries and transcripts from an investigation begun after the unexpected denouement of the plan; its heart is Jones's journey from skepticism to belief.</p>
        <p>The Midnight Choir  By Gene Kerrigan  356 pages. Europa Editions. $14.95.</p>
        <p>On a Wednesday afternoon in Galway, Joe Mills, a garda or Irish policeman, talks a suicidal man out of jumping off the roof of a pub. Meanwhile in Dublin, Detective Garda Rose Cheney and Detective Inspector Harry Synnott are investigating an alleged rape; in another part of town Dixie Peyton tries to rob a pair of American tourists, using what seems to be a syringe full of HIV-infected blood as her weapon. In this, his second crime novel, Gene Kerrigan connects the dots between those events and more in a weeklong journey through an Ireland that has been transformed by the Celtic Tiger economic boom of the '90s. At the book's center is Synnott, a man with a reputation for telling the truth. Europa Editions, which specializes in bringing European literature to the United States, is publishing the book here as a paperback.</p>
        <p>Black &amp; White  By Dani Shapiro  256 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.</p>
        <p>Ruth Dunne, a photographer, is famous for taking intimate, often naked pictures of her daughter Clara. (Sally Mann may come to mind.) Clara fled her mother's grasp the moment she turned 18, settling on Mount Desert Island in Maine. But at the start of Dani Shapiro's new novel she returns to her childhood home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where Ruth is dying of lung cancer, and tries to come to terms with the woman as a mother and an artist. ''I have hated you for so many years,'' Clara thinks as she stands by her mother's bedside, Ms. Shapiro writes. ''And then -- like an overlay, a transparency on top of the thought -- and I have loved you.''</p>

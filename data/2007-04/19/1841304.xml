      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>There are 100 product and furniture designers in ''&amp; Fork,'' out from Phaidon Press next month ($69.95), chosen by 10 curators and arranged alphabetically to make a contemporary and global encyclopedia of what happens when wit, whimsy and rigor are brought to bear on ordinary items. Three highlights: the deliriously functional polypropylene underwear dryers by Manuel Bandeira, a Brazilian designer, which are shaped like bikini briefs and attach to a shower wall with suction cups, right; the purple lacquer wood console by Jaime Hayon, from Barcelona, with its 12 cartoonishly turned legs; and the reductively functional mangastrap by ixi, the design team of Xavier Moulin and Izumi Kohama, based in Okinawa, which was designed for manga (comics) readers on crowded subways, hence the name. The strap is actually a kind of vest that is padded at the upper back and fitted with vertical straps in front where your wrists can rest comfortably, supporting your whole arm and nicely turning your body into a piece of furniture.</p>

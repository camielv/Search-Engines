        <p>A zillion gadgets, it seems, let you pipe music from a portable player through your car stereo. But not all let you control the player with a separate knob and are both neat and easy to install.</p>
        <p>Harman Kardon says a modular system like its Drive + Play 2 can do all of that. Coming next month for $400, in stores and online, it includes a 3.5-inch dashtop color display screen, a wireless control knob (for volume, muting, music selection, and iPod menu controls) that can be mounted wherever convenient, and a connection hub.</p>

        <p>A zillion gadgets, it seems, let you pipe music from a portable player through your car stereo. But not all let you control the player with a separate knob and are both neat and easy to install.</p>
        <p>Harman Kardon says a modular system like its Drive + Play 2 can do all of that. Coming next month for $400, in stores and online, it includes a 3.5-inch dashtop color display screen, a wireless control knob (for volume, muting, music selection, and iPod menu controls) that can be mounted wherever convenient, and a connection hub.</p>
        <p>The hub's U.S.B. connection works with Apple's iPod, Microsoft's Zune, and most other players. The hub has a line output for direct connection to stereos with audio inputs, and an FM modulator to broadcast music to stereos without them. A lighter-socket plug powers the hub but snaps off to reveal connections that can be wired into your dash. A software voice speaks menu names and initial letters as you turn the control knob, so you can keep your eyes on the road -- helpful to people whose players hold a zillion songs.</p>

        <p>In an awkward night of television, as network news specials about the shootings at Virginia Polytechnic Institute bumped up against country music performances on ''American Idol,'' Fox eclipsed all its rivals in the ratings Tuesday. According to Nielsen estimates, 25.9 million viewers tuned in for the music competition at 8 p.m. NBC's ''Dateline,'' with Stone Phillips reporting from Blacksburg, Va., ranked fourth in the same hour with 5.1 million viewers. ABC and CBS fared better with their specials at 10. ABC's ''Primetime,'' with Diane Sawyer, led the hour over all with 11.3 million viewers, while CBS's ''48 Hours,'' which featured Katie Couric as anchor, finished third (6.5 million) behind a repeat of NBC's ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' (8.3 million). ABC posted a solid second place for the night with a ''Dancing With the Stars'' recap show at 8 (6.9 million) followed by results show at 9 (16.2 million). Fox's ''House,'' however, remained No. 1 in the 9 p.m. hour (22.6 million).</p>

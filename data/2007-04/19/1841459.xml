        <p>The Most Rev. Rowan Williams, archbishop of Canterbury, left, has announced he will visit the United States in September to meet with bishops of the Episcopal Church, who last month declared an ''urgent need'' for such a meeting. The archbishop, spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion, has been struggling to keep the communion intact despite deep divisions over homosexuality, the authority of Scripture and the meaning of Anglicanism. ''A communion divided into a liberal segment and a conservative segment would be very, very much impoverished on both sides,'' he said at a news conference. The archbishop and other Anglican leaders will join the bishops Sept. 20 to 25 at a previously scheduled meeting in New Orleans.</p>

        <p>THEY were reverent about the music -- '70s and '80s chart toppers like ''Rich Girl,'' ''Maneater'' and ''Out of Touch.'' But the rockers performing Hall &amp; Oates's greatest hits at the Loser's Lounge at Joe's Pub in Manhattan Saturday night were not so pious in their garb.</p>
        <p>Jeff La Greca, near left, a camped-up ringer for John Oates, his idol, raked his fingers though his copious curls.

        <p>Others wore their vintage weeds like talismans, showing off raucous plaid flares, baby-doll frocks and a crazy assortment of headbands and shades. Steve Welsh (in stripes, bottom center) accessorized with a banged-up sax, while Anney Fresh (below) mugged beneath a platinum wig. Her look was ''lounge zombie,'' she said, capped by that beehive. ''It's my magic hairdo. I can't sing without it.''</p>

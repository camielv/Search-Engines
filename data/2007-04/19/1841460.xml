        <p>Thailand unveiled a draft constitution that eliminates direct elections for the Senate while bolstering the power of the unelected judiciary. The document, posted on Parliament's Web site, was drafted by a 35-member committee selected by the junta and will be presented at public forums beginning next week, and then to a national referendum in September. While the 1997 Constitution rescinded by the coup leaders sought to consolidate Thai politics and avoid the fractured coalitions of the 1990s, its proposed replacement seeks to decentralize power by buttressing the power of judges and bureaucrats.</p>

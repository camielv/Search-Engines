        <p>Despite big drops in sales, the top two albums on last week's Billboard chart retained their positions this week. The pop compilation ''Now That's What I Call Music!'' Vol. 24 holds at No. 1 with 89,000 copies sold in its third week out, according to Nielsen SoundScan -- 58 percent less than it sold last week -- and ''Let It Go'' (Curb) by Tim McGraw, above left, sold 66,000, down 66 percent. Akon's ''Konvicted'' (Universal) sold 60,000, which was 20 percent less than last week. But in the peculiar calculus of this year's music slump, that was enough to send the album up six spots to No. 3. Bright Eyes, led by the Nebraska indie-rock darling Conor Oberst, above right, had its best sales and chart week ever, with ''Cassadaga'' (Saddle Creek) selling 58,000 copies to reach No. 4. HellYeah, a metal supergroup featuring members of Pantera, Mudvayne and Nothingface, opened at No. 9 with 45,000 sales of its self-titled debut album on Epic, and ''A Hundred Miles or More: A Collection'' (Rounder) by the bluegrass fiddler and singer Alison Krauss, held at No. 10.</p>

        <p>Stones' Mild Horses Plan Troubles Animal Lovers</p>
        <p>A plan to sedate more than 300 horses at a Belgrade race track where a Rolling Stones concert on July 14 is expected to draw more than 100,000 people has ignited rage among Serbian animal lovers, Reuters reported yesterday. O.R.C.A., the country's largest animal protection society, said that the noise and vibrations of the concert would be extremely harmful to the animals and added that sedating them is not the answer. The society said that if it failed to persuade the organizers to move the concert from the Hippodrome, Belgrade's largest fenced space, it would appeal directly to the Stones -- including Mick Jagger, above -- who have never performed in Serbia. ''I believe we'll succeed, since such a reputable band will not allow such a stain on its record,'' said Elvir Burazerovic, the president of O.R.C.A.</p>
        <p>A Book Club of One</p>
        <p>The Canadian author Yann Martel, below, who wrote the best-selling novel ''Life of Pi,'' wants the country's prime minister, Stephen Harper, to pay more attention to the arts. So Mr. Martel is sending him some reading. Mr. Martel said he was upset that Mr. Harper had appeared to pay no attention during a recent ceremony honoring Canadian artists, Reuters reported. ''But he must have moments of stillness,'' Mr. Martel said. ''For as long as Stephen Harper is prime minister of Canada, I vow to send him every two weeks, mailed on a Monday, a book that has been known to expand stillness.'' First up: ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'' by Leo Tolstoy. There was no immediate comment from Mr. Harper's office. Mr. Martel said he would post all selections and other developments on the Internet at whatisstephenharperreading.ca.</p>
        <p>'Survivor' Heads for China</p>

        <p>Kirov Ballet Plans A City Center Visit</p>

        <p>Gere's Kisses Reach Court</p>
        <p>India's overburdened judicial system has two new cases after three lawyers filed complaints against Richard Gere, 57, for kissing the actress Shilpa Shetty, below, 31, at an AIDS awareness rally in New Delhi, The Associated Press reported. Public displays of affection are largely taboo in India. In one complaint a lawyer accused the actors of committing ''an obscene act,'' the Press Trust of India reported. Two other lawyers filed another complaint in Ghaziabad, a town on the outskirts of New Delhi, naming Ms. Shetty and private television channels for showing videos of the incident. Ms. Shetty said the hug and kisses were not obscene and that the public was overreacting. Yesterday, her representative, Dale Bhagwagar, declined comment on the court complaints but said, ''The media should concentrate on the cause of AIDS awareness rather than making an issue out of kisses.''</p>

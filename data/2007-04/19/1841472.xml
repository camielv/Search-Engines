        <p>A homeless man died in his jail cell while in police custody on Monday, the police said yesterday. The man, Dennis Cafila, 55, had been arrested on Saturday at the corner of Seneca Avenue and Faile Street for criminal possession of a controlled substance. He was found dead in his cell at the central booking facility in Morris Heights, and his death did not immediately appear suspicious, the police said. The medical examiner is expected to conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death.</p>

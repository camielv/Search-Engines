        <p>The Canadian National Railway lifted a lockout against striking workers in five cities after a special labor law, passed Tuesday by the House of Commons through a special accelerated process, was approved by the Senate and swiftly signed into law by Governor-General Michaëlle Jean, the formal head of state. An arbitrator will now impose a settlement. The United Transportation Union began rotating strikes against Canadian National last week after its workers overwhelmingly rejected a tentative contract. That proposed contract had ended a 15-day general strike in February that had caused industrial disruption in Canada and shipping delays to the United States. The dispute focuses on work rules, particularly those concerning older employees.</p>

        <p>MICROSOFT WINDOWS FOR $3 Microsoft plans to offer a stripped-down version of Windows, Office and other software for $3 to people in developing nations. The program is to be announced in Beijing by Bill Gates. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>A CHECK ON EXORBITANT PAY The House has begun debating a bill that would give shareholders the right to a nonbinding vote on the pay packages of senior executives of public companies. [C2.]</p>
        <p>10 HOURS WITHOUT A BLACKBERRY Where were you when the BlackBerrys went out? On Tuesday night technical problems cut off more than five million American BlackBerry users from their cherished wireless e-mail. Service was restored 10 long, data-starved hours later. [C1.]</p>
        <p>OUTSOURCING'S NEW LOCALE Cities in Central and Eastern Europe are turning into centers for outsourced white-collar jobs for multinational corporations. The countries offer a highly educated, multilingual pool of talent in an increasingly affluent consumer market -- all barely a stone's throw from prime clients. [C1.]</p>
        <p>JOURNAL NAMES TOP EDITOR The competition for the most powerful position in business journalism ended as Marcus W. Brauchli was named managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, succeeding Paul E. Steiger, who has held the top job in the newsroom since 1991. [C1.]</p>
        <p>$81 MILLION PROFIT AT AMR The AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, swung to an $81 million profit from a loss a year ago as it filled more seats, charged higher fares and paid less for fuel. AMR is the first major United States airline to report first-quarter results. Its profit may set the tone for the industry, which endured several weather-related cancellations in the first three months of the year. [C2.]</p>
        <p>2 NEW PLANTS FOR CHRYSLER The Chrysler Group will spend $1.43 billion to build two plants in Michigan that will make parts for Chrysler and Mercedes vehicles, even as the American and German companies prepare for a possible divorce. [C3.]</p>
        <p>PROFIT SURGE AT JPMORGAN CHASE JPMorgan Chase, the nation's third-largest bank, reported a 55 percent surge in first-quarter profit, reflecting strength across most of its primary businesses. Still, the report showed some softness in the retail banking and credit card divisions. [C2.]</p>
        <p>U.S.-BRITISH LABOR MERGER The United Steelworkers announced that it would seek to merge with two large British unions in a move that would create the first trans-Atlantic labor group. [C2.]</p>
        <p>EBAY ENHANCED BY NEW UNITS EBay posted better-than-expected profit in the first quarter as several of its newer businesses compensated for disappointing results in its mainstay auction service. The faster-growing units include shopping.com, a price comparison site; some classified listing sites; and Skype, the online voice chat service. ''We are on track with our well-crafted portfolio,'' said Meg Whitman, above, eBay's chief executive. [C3.]</p>
        <p>YAHOO SUED IN TORTURE CASE A Chinese political prisoner and his wife sued Yahoo in federal court in San Francisco, accusing the company of abetting the commission of torture by helping Chinese authorities identify political dissidents who were later beaten and imprisoned. [C4.]</p>
        <p>DELL STILL SLIPPING Dell's personal computer sales continued to decline in the first quarter, and Dell continued to lose market share, according to analyses of PC sales. [C4.]</p>
        <p>LIFE AFTER HARVARD Lawrence H. Summers, who was forced to step down as president of Harvard amid controversy and criticism, is facing a much friendlier audience in Asia, where his views on global economics draw overflow crowds. [C5.]</p>
        <p>MOTOROLA'S PROSPECTS DIM Motorola, the wireless phone maker, reported a loss for the first quarter and issued a disappointing forecast for the second, leading some analysts to question whether it would be able to return to profitability this year. [C4.]</p>
        <p>TEACH FIRST, THEN SELL Sharp Electronics, which makes rooftop solar panels, has embarked on a six-month campaign to teach homeowners how solar energy works. Advertising. [C10.]</p>
        <p>A RECORD FOR THE DOW The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 12,800 for the first time, a recovery from Wall Street's steep decline in February. [C10.]</p>

        <p>ABBOTT LABORATORIES, the pharmaceutical and medical products maker, reported a 19 percent drop in first-quarter profit Wednesday as a result of acquisition costs, but exceeded Wall Street estimates because of its fast-growing drug business. (AP)</p>
        <p>E*TRADE FINANCIAL, the brokerage firm, reported first-quarter results that beat Wall Street projections, but it warned that recent market turbulence would dent earnings for the year. (AP)</p>
        <p>ALLSTATE SAID THAT its first-quarter profit rose 5 percent as investment gains offset a decline in revenue from property-liability insurance premiums. (AP)</p>

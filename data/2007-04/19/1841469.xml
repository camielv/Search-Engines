        <p>The state commission overseeing judges said yesterday that its chairman, Raoul Felder, no longer speaks for the panel. Last week, Mr. Felder received a unanimous vote of no confidence from the nine other members of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct after they accused him of invoking ''racial, ethnic and religious invective'' in a book that he wrote with Jackie Mason. Gov. Eliot Spitzer has also called for Mr. Felder to step down, but he has refused to do so and has disputed characterizations about his book. The commission said yesterday that the staff administrator would speak for the commission, and that the clerk would sign the panel's orders. Mr. Felder said he did not oppose any of the steps being taken.</p>

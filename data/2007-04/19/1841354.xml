        <p>Opposition candidates in Nigeria's presidential election, now just three days away, have threatened a boycott unless the polling is delayed to ensure what they have called ''a level playing field for all.''</p>
        <p>Their decision, announced Tuesday night, threw an already chaotic election season into deeper confusion and raised the possibility that the long-planned vote might not take place Saturday.</p>
        <p>Nigeria's government rejected the demand, saying Wednesday that the vote would proceed.</p>
        <p>The opposition's threat to boycott and the government's insistence that the election will go forward have set up a showdown as the country tries to have its first transfer of power between elected civilians. Nigeria's current president, Olusegun Obasanjo, is stepping down after two four-year terms. His election in 1999 capped three decades of near-continuous military rule.</p>
        <p>''This is really a dangerous turning point for the country,'' said Nnamdi K. Obasi, the senior analyst in Nigeria for the International Crisis Group, which seeks to prevent violent conflict. ''It may well mark the beginning of a period of real instability. It could produce a government with no legitimacy in a very unstable environment.''</p>
        <p>Denouncing the state elections of last Saturday as a ''sham,'' the coalition of opposition parties said in a statement that, ''it is clear that no credible elections can be conducted under the current dispensation and unless a fundamental change in structure occurs there must be no further elections.''</p>
        <p>The elections last week, to choose governors and state assemblies in Nigeria's 36 states, were marred by violence and fraud. Election officials have already canceled the results in two states, and a coalition of local observers urged that voting be redone in eight additional states.</p>
        <p>International observers have also raised serious concerns about the voting in a number of states, further undermining the legitimacy of those polls, which the governing People's Democratic Party largely swept.</p>
        <p>But it was unclear on Wednesday whether the opposition could maintain a boycott of the next round of voting.</p>
        <p>The main beneficiary would probably be Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Action Congress Party, whom election officials had removed from the ballot because of corruption allegations against him. A court ruling reinstated him at the last moment. Election officials have not said how his name would be added to the millions of ballots, which bear the pictures of the 24 other candidates, by Saturday.</p>
        <p>But other candidates, especially in areas where they are likely to win, have much to lose.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, the opposition parties have a tendency to bicker. Despite an agreement between the Action Congress and the All Nigeria People's Party to choose a common candidate as a united front against the governing People's Democratic Party, or P.D.P., each put up its own.</p>
        <p>Senior members of several delegations of international observers met here on Wednesday amid growing concern that the election was being unfairly manipulated by pro-government elements in the Independent National Electoral Commission.</p>
        <p>The observers plan to urge Mr. Obasanjo to make sure the vote, if it goes forward, is handled properly.</p>
        <p>''The situation is completely unacceptable, and something needs to be done,'' said a senior observer from West Africa who was not authorized to speak publicly. A senior Western election observer said there was clear evidence that the electoral commission was not impartial.</p>
        <p>''My overriding impression is that INEC has gone from just being a bumbling institution with low capacity to being an active instrument with P.D.P. and local police to make sure that P.D.P. rides into dominance as a single party,'' the observer said.</p>
        <p>The opposition parties listed in their statement examples of inconsistencies. In Anambra State election officials said 1.9 million people voted for the ruling party candidate for governor, even though just 1.84 million people are registered to vote.</p>
        <p>Nigerian officials have said that the election was a success and that problems were limited to two states where new elections will be held.</p>

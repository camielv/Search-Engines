        <p>With Attorney General Alberto Gonzales testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, the Op-Ed page asked four legal experts to step into a senator's shoes and list three questions they would ask Mr. Gonzales.</p>
        <p>1. Several United States attorneys were terminated because of a supposed lack of aggressiveness in cases of voter fraud. But while studies suggest that voter fraud is relatively rare and isolated, there has been a recent escalation of voter suppression and illegal tactics to prevent voting, especially in minority communities. If some attorneys were terminated because they failed to combat voter fraud, why weren't any terminated for failing to prosecute voter suppression?</p>
        <p>2. Your administration rejected the community-based crime-fighting policies of the Clinton administration, and instead adopted a more ''hard-line'' approach. E-mail messages show that several of the ousted United States attorneys had sparred with your office over anticrime policy. But if you believe that we should be holding prosecutors accountable for performance, what are we to make of the fact that, during your term as attorney general, violent crime has risen by the largest amount in 15 years? Is this spike because eight United States attorneys refused to follow your direction, or is it because more than 80 of them did?</p>
        <p>3. In your previous post as White House counsel, you played a major role in the selection of United States attorneys. Indeed, the fired prosecutors represented nearly one-tenth of all the serving United States attorneys whom you helped select -- a record level of performance-related terminations. If such a high percentage of attorneys had to be removed for performance reasons, what does this say about the selection process that you oversaw?</p>

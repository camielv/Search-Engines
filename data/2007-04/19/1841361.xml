        <p>A federal investigation into the awarding of grants in New Jersey's state budget has expanded to the Town of West New York, apparently to include the former speaker of the State Assembly, who was also the town mayor.</p>
        <p>Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed state budget documents from the period when Albio Sires, who is now a Democratic congressman, was the Assembly speaker and the mayor of West New York, in Hudson County, the town attorney said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The investigation is part of a wider investigation begun by the United States attorney for New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie, who is investigating whether state legislators and officials benefited improperly from so-called Christmas tree items, which typically involve special state grants for pet projects that are added to the budget at the last moment.</p>
        <p>Last month, three Democratic state legislators were issued subpoenas seeking explanations of their relationship to institutions that received the special state grants.</p>
        <p>Daniel E. Horgan, the West New York attorney, said in a telephone interview yesterday that the documents subpoenaed from the town concern grants as far back as January 2004, and that the town had handed over documents as recently as Monday.</p>
        <p>''We've done that which we've been asked to do,'' Mr. Horgan said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Horgan confirmed that two grants under investigation included $2 million to the West New York Parking Authority in the 2006 fiscal year, to refurbish an abandoned garage; and $250,000 to the West New York Senior Outreach Transportation Program the next fiscal year, to buy two buses for the elderly. The grants were first reported by The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Julie Roginsky, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sires, denied any wrongdoing, and said that Mr. Sires had not been served a subpoena. She said that before his election in November, he had been subject to intense scrutiny and ''not once did anyone ever allege that he did anything to enrich himself, and I think these projects speak for themselves.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Roginsky added: ''He went down to Trenton to get grants. That's part of the reason he was sent down to Trenton, to get grants. He's proud of what he did.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Christie declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Although the Christmas tree process is not illegal, some groups have argued for greater transparency in the state's $30 billion budget. Last year, Gov. Jon S. Corzine removed $50 million from the budget, much of it in such special grants.</p>
        <p>A report from the State Commission of Investigation issued yesterday found that this way of budgeting had ''skewed'' financing away from acute-care hospitals, and toward other institutions, by ''delivering financial assistance to hospitals without regard to the real costs incurred.''</p>
        <p>As for the documents sought in West New York, Mr. Horgan said that Mr. Sires had not been named in the subpoena, although he said that the period being investigated corresponded to Mr. Sires's time in office. Mr. Sires was speaker from 2002 to 2006 and mayor of West New York from 1995 until 2006, when he was elected to Congress.</p>
        <p>The investigation is an outgrowth of a federal monitor's report that found the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey had received $12.8 million in special grants after State Senator Wayne R. Bryant, a Democrat from Camden who was chairman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee, had been appointed to a no-show job there that helped enhance his pension. Mr. Bryant was named in a 20-count federal indictment last month.</p>

        <p>With Attorney General Alberto Gonzales testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, the Op-Ed page asked four legal experts to step into a senator's shoes and list three questions they would ask Mr. Gonzales.</p>
        <p>1. Can politics truly be kept out of the investigations into the recent dismissal of several United States attorneys if such oversight is being led by a senator who is himself responsible for the election of Democratic senatorial candidates in 2008?</p>
        <p>2. Doesn't the Constitution make the president the law enforcement officer in chief precisely so he can make sure that all 93 United States attorneys are following the law enforcement priorities that he was elected to enforce? And doesn't the Constitution specifically limit Congress's role in removal of United States attorneys to impeaching them or their superiors for high crimes and misdemeanors?</p>
        <p>3. Have you, President Bush or anyone else in the administration ever, to your knowledge, sought to stop or start a criminal investigation by a United States attorney for political reasons?</p>

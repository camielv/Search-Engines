        <p>ATHLETES come up with all manner of excuses not to wear sunscreen: sticky hands, stinging eyes, feeling like a grease monkey, to name a few. But active people in particular should take precautions, said Dr. Brian Adams, a dermatology professor at the University of Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>''Skin cancer is one of the few things for which participation in sports actually increases risk,'' said Dr. Adams, author of ''Sports Dermatology.'' Athletes spend extended periods of time in the sun, and often ''at the worst times, between 11 and 4, when you have practices.'' Sweating also increases your chance of getting burned, he added.</p>

        <p>To appeal to finicky athletes, companies design formulations that are less greasy and less apt to run into eyes, with packaging that makes application easier.</p>
        <p>Heather Gollnick, a three-time Ironman winner, tested the latest batch in sunny 80-degree weather -- swimming, cycling and running around Bradenton, Fla. All of them protected her from the sun, she said, but some worked longer, were less greasy or were easier to use.</p>

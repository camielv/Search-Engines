      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>After 18 years of making nature-inspired tabletop objects in metals like bronze, copper and stainless steel, Michael Aram has opened his first store, in Chelsea, above. Mr. Aram, far left, said he has made more than 2,000 pieces and wanted a ''handmade'' space -- ''like my work'' -- where he could show them off. The designer, an American now based in New Delhi, collaborated on the plan with James Harb, a New York architect. The store has hand-finished black-plaster walls, gold-leaf panels and tiles that Mr. Aram made himself. Items for sale include the Leaf series of trays in polished aluminum ($27.50 to $95), top left, and the Pod Round Platter ($210), left. Michael Aram Flagship Store, 136 West 18th Street, (212) 461-6903.</p>

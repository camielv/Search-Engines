        <p>With Attorney General Alberto Gonzales testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, the Op-Ed page asked four legal experts to step into a senator's shoes and list three questions they would ask Mr. Gonzales.</p>
        <p>1. Your determination to fire prosecutors who were not ''loyal Bushies'' has its intellectual roots in the theory of the ''unitary executive,'' which holds that the president should be able to extend his political control over all executive branch officers, including not only political appointees but also lower-level career officials. Are you familiar with the leading scholarly defenses of this theory, and do you agree with them?</p>

        <p>With Attorney General Alberto Gonzales testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, the Op-Ed page asked four legal experts to step into a senator's shoes and list three questions they would ask Mr. Gonzales.</p>
        <p>1. Your determination to fire prosecutors who were not ''loyal Bushies'' has its intellectual roots in the theory of the ''unitary executive,'' which holds that the president should be able to extend his political control over all executive branch officers, including not only political appointees but also lower-level career officials. Are you familiar with the leading scholarly defenses of this theory, and do you agree with them?</p>
        <p>2. The original defenders of the unitary executive theory in the Reagan administration recognized the need for neutral, professional prosecutors in the Justice Department, but you and your aides evaluated prosecutors purely in terms of their political loyalty. Did that lead you to try to intervene in specific prosecutions for partisan ends, which everyone agrees would be improper if not illegal?</p>
        <p>3. Because of your decision to screen all Justice Department appointees for their loyalty to President Bush, young lawyers who applied for even nonpolitical jobs have been routinely administered political litmus tests. How can Americans have faith in the ability of the Justice Department to defend the rule of law impartially and professionally when all of its employees are hired or fired for their politics?</p>

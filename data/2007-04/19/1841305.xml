        <p>Along with the usual exhibitors at the 15th annual Antique Garden Furniture Show and Sale, opening April 27 at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, will be several showing more exotic garden follies. Ana Thompson, owner of the Thompson Studio in Berwyn, Pa., will sell 17th- and 18th-century Chinese limestone garden seats from Shanxi province ($8,500 to $15,000). Barbara Israel, from Katonah, N.Y., whose booth will resemble a shop in southwest France, will sell mostly French items, with a few exceptions, among them the bronze ''Baby Bacchus'' ($25,000), above, by Beatrice Fenton, a Philadelphia sculptor (1887-1983). Through April 29; nybg.org.</p>

        <p>A member of the Public Service Commission, which regulates public utilities in New York State, charged yesterday that an aide to Gov. Eliot Spitzer threatened to have her removed if she did not back away from efforts to investigate Consolidated Edison over last year's blackout in Queens. The member, Cheryl Buley, a commissioner appointed last year by Gov. George E. Pataki, made the accusation against Steve A. Mitnick, an assistant secretary to Mr. Spitzer, as the commission voted unanimously yesterday to proceed with the investigation. The investigation, which was opposed by the utility and by New York City officials, allows the commission to determine whether the company can charge customers some of the costs associated with the blackout. Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer, said no one from the administration told Ms. Buley to vote against the investigation, which she said the governor supports.</p>

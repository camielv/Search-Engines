        <p>Remembering some of the students killed at Virginia Tech, in these biographical sketches.</p>
        <p>Rachael E. Hill, 18</p>
        <p>A freshman, she graduated in 2006 from the Grove Avenue Christian School in Henrico County, Va. She was studying biology. Clay Fogler, school administrator for Grove Avenue, said she had a penchant for shoes and was competitive on the volleyball court. He said Ms. Hill's senior yearbook quotation from C. S. Lewis summed up what school officials believe she would say at this time: ''God, who foresaw your tribulation, has specially armed you to go through it, not without pain but without stain.''</p>
        <p>Jarrett Lane, 22</p>
        <p>A senior and recipient of a special scholarship for engineering students, he was in G. V. Loganathan's classroom when he was killed. He came from Narrows, Va., and was valedictorian of his class at Narrows High School in 2003. His former teachers spoke of him as a four-sport athlete, remembered for his humility and work ethic.</p>
        <p>Partahi Mamora Lumbantoruan, 34</p>
        <p>A doctoral student in civil engineering, he was one of 16 Indonesians at Virginia Tech. He arrived three years ago from Parahyangan University in the West Java capital of Bandung. His father, a retired Army officer, said he had sold off property and cars to finance his son's tuition. Rhondy Rahardja, president of the Indonesian Students Organization, said Mr. Lumbantoruan was ''superdisciplined,'' and always wore a polo shirt tucked neatly into his pants. The Indonesian student association offered to clean up his apartment. That's where they learned his secret passion: ''He had 30 films, all about war,'' Mr. Rahardja said, from ''The Thin Red Line'' to ''The Alamo.''</p>
        <p>Daniel P. O'Neil, 22</p>
        <p>He was pursuing a master's in environmental engineering and also served as a teaching assistant at Virginia Tech. From Lincoln, R.I., he was an avid runner, a prolific musician and a big fan of the Beatles, friends said. Mr. O'Neil earned his bachelor's degree at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., where he studied the effects of urban development on regional watersheds.</p>
        <p>But his passion was writing music, which he posted to his Web site www.residenthippy.com.</p>
        <p>Minal Panchal, 26</p>
        <p>An architecture student from Mumbai, India, she graduated from high school in Mumbai and the Rizvi College of Architecture. Ms. Panchal's Orkut site -- a MySpace for young Indians -- listed her passions as buildings and nature. Among her favorite books were the ''Harry Potter'' series, ''Little Women'' and ''To Kill a Mockingbird.''</p>
        <p>Waleed Shaalan, 32</p>
        <p>He came to the United States in 2006 from Zagazig, Egypt, leaving behind his wife and 1-year-old son, to follow in his father's footsteps studying civil engineering. He was a member of the Muslim Student Association. On the day he died he told Fahad Pasha, a roommate, that he planned to bring his family to the United States this summer.</p>
        <p>Randy Dymond, a civil engineering professor at Virginia Tech, said Mr. Shaalan saved the life of a fellow graduate student. Mr. Dymond said the student recounted to him how he and Mr. Shaalan were both in the first classroom the gunman entered. He shot Dr. Loganathan and several students. Mr. Shaalan was badly wounded and lay beside the student, who was not shot but played dead, as the gunman returned two times. Just as the gunman noticed the student, Mr. Shaalan made a move to distract him, at which point he was shot a second time and died. The student believed that Mr. Shaalan purposely distracted the gunman to save him, Mr. Dymond said.</p>
        <p>Nicole White, 20</p>
        <p>In her junior year, she grew up in Isle of Wight County, Va., loving horses and the water. A friend, Chance Hellmann, who graduated from Smithfield High School with Ms. White in 2004, said she intended to follow a veterinary track at Virginia Tech but she was ultimately drawn to a double major, in international studies and German.</p>

        <p>FOR most people, a decorator show house is more a place of fantasy than reality. The furniture and the artwork are often expensive, the rooms larger than life. But there are always professionally executed details that one can learn from and ideas for do-it-yourselfers to try at home.</p>
        <p>This year the Kips Bay Decorator Show House, a six-floor town house at 14 East 82nd Street, is filled with unusual wall treatments that can be adapted for use in real homes with a little modification. A number of new products on display are available to the public. Of course, the decorators who created these rooms are available for hire, but sometimes it is more fun to try your own hand at designing your living space.</p>
        <p>1. In the dining area, L'Olivier, a New York florist, submerged pincushion blossoms in cylinders of water instead of filling vases the usual way, and Eric Cohler walled off the space with Definition resin panels by Armstrong. The two-by-six-foot panels come in 16 colors and textures, and attach to the floor and ceiling with wires. Each panel is $699; (877) 276-7876 or armstrong.com.</p>
        <p>2. Using a simple spray mount, Randall Beale and Carl Lana glued aluminum foil to the wainscoting along the staircase between the entrance foyer and the first floor. ''Our inspiration was Andy Warhol's Silver Factory,'' Mr. Beale said. ''After all, isn't a show house about experimentation?''</p>
        <p>He added: ''The foil nicks, but it acquires a patina, and it is easy to repair. If I was doing this in a real house I would coat the foil with clear polyurethane.''</p>
        <p>3. Noel Jeffrey cut grass cloth wallcovering into squares and applied them to the walls, creating a checkerboard pattern. Grass cloth comes in many colors and can be bought in rolls like regular wallpaper. Mr. Jeffrey used all one color, but a multicolor pattern would also work.</p>
        <p>4. On the second-floor landing, Ed Ku and Etienne Coffinier hammered big nailheads into the wall to create a swirling pattern to give the effect of molding or wallpaper.</p>
        <p>5. Jamie Drake used fabrics from his new F. Schumacher collection, which was ''inspired by all the French fashion stuff I love,'' he said. The chairs are covered in a silk-and-cotton blend called Babe's Tweed ($93 a yard) and the shades are made of a sheer called Bubble Lounge ($141 a yard); to the trade, from F. Schumacher, (800) 332-3384 or fschumacher.com for showrooms.</p>
        <p>6. Wayne Nathan and Carol Egan's installation is a novel and inexpensive way to cover a wall: cut pieces of packing tape printed with words like fragile, then plaster them on the wall to create texture and pattern. Mr. Nathan and Ms. Egan had their tape printed in silver and white, but red and white from the hardware store would work just as well.</p>
        <p>7. Eva Lee, a decorative arts painter and a partner in Christianson Lee Studios, used a decoupage technique on the stairwell between the fourth and fifth floors. Handpainted faux bois paper was applied to the wall, pieces of digitally cut leaf-shaped paper were layered on top, and the wall was varnished, replicating the appearance of inlaid wood. To create a similar effect, attach pieces of paper to the wall with wallpaper paste, then varnish the whole thing. Wrinkles in the paper will add texture.</p>

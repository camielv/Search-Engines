        <p>SOME designers find their inspiration at an early age, and not always while playing dress-up with Barbie.</p>
        <p>Veronica Cardenas, who worked in sales for several designers before opening a multiline showroom in SoHo in 2005, began her own collection this spring using the intricate lacework that was a familiar motif of her childhood in Paraguay. Ms. Cardenas named her collection Ilo Guaraní, after the Guaraní Indians of South America who make the lace, and she commissioned small pieces to use in her designs. She hopes to benefit those communities and raise funds to build a school there. A napkin-size piece of lace, a kaleidoscope of swirls, can take three months for a family of four to complete.</p>

        <p>SOME designers find their inspiration at an early age, and not always while playing dress-up with Barbie.</p>
        <p>Veronica Cardenas, who worked in sales for several designers before opening a multiline showroom in SoHo in 2005, began her own collection this spring using the intricate lacework that was a familiar motif of her childhood in Paraguay. Ms. Cardenas named her collection Ilo Guaraní, after the Guaraní Indians of South America who make the lace, and she commissioned small pieces to use in her designs. She hopes to benefit those communities and raise funds to build a school there. A napkin-size piece of lace, a kaleidoscope of swirls, can take three months for a family of four to complete.</p>
        <p>The collection uses the lace as subtle insets on a form-fitted tulle dress or a linen burlap jacket, which cost from $450 to $1,800 and sell at the Curve women's boutiques in New York and Los Angeles. Some pieces feature the lace prominently, as in a white cotton coat that could play host at a Thanksgiving spread.</p>
        <p>''My mom has been bringing back this lace for as long as I can remember,'' Ms. Cardenas said. ''I always had an idea that it would be nice to use it for something other than a tablecloth.''</p>
        <p>Lisa Perry came from Chicago, where her parents, textiles designers, placed a lot of emphasis on an appreciation of modern art in the home. This seems to have cast an indelible impression in Ms. Perry's aesthetic sense, as evidenced by her SoHo loft, where the molding around the elevator is painted fuchsia, and by her very focused collection of jersey trapeze dresses in Pop Art colors.</p>
        <p>Ms. Perry began selling her dresses this spring at Jeffrey New York. They seem to have time-traveled from the 1960s archives of Pierre Cardin, dragging along the clashing palette of Stephen Burrows. On her inspiration board, on either side of a Robert Indiana ''Love'' painting, there are pictures of Peggy Moffitt modeling for Rudi Gernreich.</p>
        <p>''I figured the worst thing that could happen,'' Ms. Perry said, ''is that I'd end up having 20 pieces for myself.''</p>

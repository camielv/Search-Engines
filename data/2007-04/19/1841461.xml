        <p>Officials said the body of a woman found buried in mud in the mountainous northern province of Ifugao was that of a missing Peace Corps volunteer, Julia Campbell. They said she had apparently been murdered. ''Work continues at the site to determine the circumstances,'' said a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Manila, Matthew Lussenhop. A regional police commander, Chief Superintendent Raul Gonzales, told The Associated Press, ''There is a probability that there was foul play.'' Ms. Campbell, 40, a former freelance reporter in New York who contributed to The New York Times in the 1990s and joined the Corps in 2005, was last seen on April 8 as she set off for a hike in the village of Batad, which offers a magnificent view of the centuries-old rice terraces, one of the country's tourist attractions. Ms. Campbell, from Fairfax, Va., was one of 137 Peace Corps volunteers in the Philippines. Colleagues said that her service was wrapping up and that she was excited about returning to New York.</p>

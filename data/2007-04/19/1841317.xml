        <p>9 P.M. (13, 49) FAITH WITHOUT FEAR -- This ''America at a Crossroads'' documentary follows the journey of the Muslim dissident Irshad Manji, left, as she travels through Yemen, Europe and North America on what she sees as a quest to restore humanity and reason to Islam. ''How,'' she asks, ''has a religion of justice become mired in fear?'' At 10 ''Struggle for the Soul of Islam: Inside Indonesia'' explores the country's long history of moderation in its practice of Islam, and how its Muslim majority is struggling to control the rise of Islamic extremism, which has made Indonesia a flash point in global terror.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) UGLY BETTY -- Focus, focus: Betty tries to keep Daniel's mind on the job and off the models as he resumes his hard-partying ways. But life for the Meades gets worse when a dirt-dishing writer (Leslie Jordan in a guest role) turns stalker after getting possession of Fey Sommers's diaries, sending Wilhemina and Alexis into a tizzy to get them back. Meanwhile in the Suarez household, Ignacio's immigration caseworker wants to make their relationship more than business.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (NBC) MY NAME IS EARL -- After Richard Chubby, the most powerful man in Camden, dies unexpectedly, his even crueler spawn, Little Chubby (Norm MacDonald, above right), comes back to town to take over the family business and teach Earl (Jason Lee, above left) the true meaning of sacrifice.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (NBC) 30 ROCK -- Love conquers all? A sick and tired Floyd (Jason Sudeikis) mulls a move to Cleveland and asks Liz (Tina Fey) if she would consider joining him. And Jack (Alec Baldwin) hightails it to Paris -- and possibly the altar -- with Phoebe (Emily Mortimer), the enticing Christie's auctioneer. Meanwhile Tracy fantasizes about his comeback.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) GREY'S ANATOMY -- Izzie finds comfort in George, Alex grows attached to Jane Doe, Meredith and Derek question their status, and Cristina resolves to fight for Burke.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (IFC) AT MIDNIGHT I'LL TAKE YOUR SOUL -- (1964) José Mojica Marins, director and star, unfurled his alter ego, Coffin Joe -- and became a national symbol along the lines of Freddy Krueger in the process -- in this horror film, considered Brazil's first, about a sadistic undertaker in top hat, black cape and talons who terrorizes a religious community in search of a woman to bear his child. The saga continues at 10:30 in ''This Night I Will Possess Your Corpse'' (1967) and at 12:30 a.m. in ''Awakening of the Beast'' (1970), a hallucinogenic trip through Brazilian drug culture.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (TLC) MOTORCYCLE MANIA: DAYTONA BIKE WEEK -- Russell Mitchell of Exile Cycles has just five days to build a custom motorcycle for the rocker John Mellencamp, left. And then the men go for a wild ride.</p>

        <p>There are myriad questions from the evolving tragedy at Virginia Tech. One is how such a gravely disturbed student as this killer could raise heightened concern among the authorities over a year ago, yet manage to proceed unhindered to take 32 lives. But no less pertinent is the question of how, after detailed tracking of the guns purchased for the ghastly spree, the lethal empowerment of such a troubled individual can somehow be pronounced entirely legal under the laws of a civilized nation.</p>
        <p>But it certainly seems legal.</p>

        <p>There are myriad questions from the evolving tragedy at Virginia Tech. One is how such a gravely disturbed student as this killer could raise heightened concern among the authorities over a year ago, yet manage to proceed unhindered to take 32 lives. But no less pertinent is the question of how, after detailed tracking of the guns purchased for the ghastly spree, the lethal empowerment of such a troubled individual can somehow be pronounced entirely legal under the laws of a civilized nation.</p>
        <p>But it certainly seems legal.</p>
        <p>The guns wielded by Cho Seung-Hui were traced through the laissez-faire weapons marts of Virginia and found to be legitimately obtained. So, case closed. At least according to most of the nation's political leadership, so studiously ducking the morning-after question of whether anything serious can be done, or least proposed, about such an appalling situation. The victims at Virginia Tech represent a mere tenth of 1 percent of the 30,000 gunshot deaths each year.</p>
        <p>Yet the implicit, hardly sorrow-free lesson for the nation is that beyond the usual calls for prayers and closure, there's no sense these days for a politician, particularly one running for president, to get into the risky business of even talking about the runaway gun problem.</p>
        <p>No one who tracked the last headline-consuming gun tragedies -- the Columbine high school massacre and the Washington, D.C., sniper murders -- can be surprised as political leaders slide off their obligation to propose answers, or at least candidly discuss the woeful status quo of gun violence.</p>
        <p>After those two sprees, possible remedies were proposed. But none were passed as the gun lobby cracked its whip in Washington. The most that happened were delays in the passage of an egregious proposal, signed a safe time afterward by President Bush, that brazenly denied gunshot victims and plagued cities the right to sue the gun industry for negligence.</p>
        <p>Politicians should at least have the guts to tell the nation that retrogression is the state of gun control in America. But Congress's new Democratic majority is a study in caginess, its leaders obviously mindful of the warning -- issued by Terry McAuliffe, the former party chairman who is now a principal in Senator Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign -- to avoid the subject as a third-rail loser. The question in the '08 campaign is whether major candidates will dare to speak of Virginia Tech as anything more than an occasion to express grief.</p>

        <p>HART--Kitty Carlisle. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Kitty Carlisle Hart, our irrepressible, multi-talanted, and much loved Honorary Trustee, colleague, and friend. Always a celebrated champion of the arts in New York, she turned her personal and professional spotlight on the cultural life of this city and state, first as an artist and later as chair of the New York State Council on the Arts for two decades. She was part of this museum in so many ways--as performer, lecturer, co-chair of our musical instruments visiting committee, advisor, audience member--always gracious, helpful, and wise. We will miss her elegance, vivacity, and wit, and will hold a song in our hearts for this outstanding woman whose zest for life and art did so much to enrich us all. We'll be loving her always. James R. Houghton, Chrman. Philippe de Montebello, Dir. Emily K. Rafferty, President.</p>
        <p>$(6$)HART--Kitty Carlisle. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the death of Kitty Carlisle Hart.

We will remember Kitty for her grace, charm, fearless advocacy of the arts, and for her very special performance as the honoree of the Museum's Party in the Garden in 1999. We extend our deepest sympathy to her daughter Catherine, her son Christopher, and three grandchildren. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Robert B. Menschel, Chairman Marie-Josee Kravis, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director</p>

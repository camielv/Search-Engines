        <p>A new cellphone with fewer features than its predecessor is a rarity, but don't tell T-Mobile. The Sidekick ID, made by Danger, is a stripped-down version of the Sidekick 3 and is aimed squarely at the teenage set. It will be available at a considerable discount over its older sibling.</p>
        <p>The ID has a 2.5-inch swiveling color screen that pops up to reveal a full QWERTY keyboard. It is covered in gray plastic bumpers that are removable. T-Mobile and other retailers will sell customized back plates and bumpers for about $20 when the phone is available on April 25.</p>

        <p>A new cellphone with fewer features than its predecessor is a rarity, but don't tell T-Mobile. The Sidekick ID, made by Danger, is a stripped-down version of the Sidekick 3 and is aimed squarely at the teenage set. It will be available at a considerable discount over its older sibling.</p>
        <p>The ID has a 2.5-inch swiveling color screen that pops up to reveal a full QWERTY keyboard. It is covered in gray plastic bumpers that are removable. T-Mobile and other retailers will sell customized back plates and bumpers for about $20 when the phone is available on April 25.</p>
        <p>The phone is compatible with AIM, Yahoo and MSN messaging and POP/IMAP e-mail. It also works with T-Mobile's MyFaves calling plan and offers unlimited Internet access. The data service costs an extra $20 a month.</p>
        <p>Price separates the Sidekick ID from the Sidekick 3: it costs $99 with a two-year contract, half the price of the Sidekick 3.</p>
        <p>At 6.9 ounces, the ID is also lighter than the Sidekick 3 -- though it lacks a memory card slot, a camera and a Bluetooth wireless connection. Still, the Sidekick ID straddles the fine line between cool phone and smart phone with aplomb.</p>

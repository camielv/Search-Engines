        <p>Overruling a Parliamentary committee and the national regulator, Canada's Conservative government announced Wednesday that it was largely deregulating the country's telephone market.</p>
        <p>The industry minister, Maxime Bernier, said that local markets served by at least three operators with their own networks -- including existing telephone companies, cable system operators and cellphone service providers -- would be eligible for deregulation after April 18.</p>
        <p>The current regulatory system tightly controls phone companies unless they lose 25 percent of their customers in any market, and also limits their ability to recover lost customers through so-called win-back discounts.</p>
        <p>''Canada's new government is of the view that accelerated deregulation is appropriate and that win-back rules are no longer required,'' Mr. Bernier said in a statement. ''In a competitive sector, there is no reason to prevent consumers from getting the best offers.''</p>
        <p>Opponents of deregulation, including some consumer groups and cable companies, argued at Parliamentary hearings that without restrictions, established telephone companies would drive out competitors by offering discounts, and then raise prices over the long term.</p>
        <p>Unlike those in the United States, Canada's telephone companies were never broken into separate local and long-distance operations to alleviate antitrust concerns. The result is that telecommunications services are dominated in eastern Canada by Bell Canada and other units of Montreal-based BCE, while Telus, based in Vancouver, controls the market in much of western Canada. At the end of 2005, established operators controlled about 90 percent of local lines.</p>
        <p>Janet Yale, the executive vice president for corporate affairs at Telus, dismissed suggestions that deregulation would ultimately diminish competition. ''I think there may be a little fear of the unknown here,'' Ms. Yale said. ''But the reality will be a better situation for customers.''</p>
        <p>Last week, a Parliamentary committee requested a full telecommunications bill that could be debated in Parliament. While the Conservative government does not control Parliament, the plan announced on Wednesday will not require legislative approval.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernier did adopt some of the committee's suggestions, however, including the establishment of an independent telecommunications ombudsman for consumer complaints, to be financed by the industry.</p>
        <p>Lawson Hunter, Bell Canada's executive vice president, praised Mr. Bernier for ignoring his critics. ''I can't give enough credit to Mr. Bernier,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''To be honest, he is more passionate about this than I am.''</p>

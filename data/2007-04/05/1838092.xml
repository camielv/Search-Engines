        <p>It's 9 a.m., the air temperature is 15, the Taku winds are blowing and the gun-smoke gray sky spews snow over Juneau. The February snow stacks up on the boat docks of Harris Harbor, but cannot match the knee-length brown rubber boots Laurie Lindsey wears.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lindsey, 50, climbs onto the Kirsten Anne, a 49-foot ketch that sleeps eight and has been around the world twice. She is a 50-year-old entrepreneur with short black hair, long earrings, a quick smile and few wrinkles, despite 20 years working outside and one failed business. She started as a cook on a crab boat that fished year-round on the Bering Sea and by the late 1980s, she and her husband at the time, Glenn Organ, had their own commercial fishing business.</p>

        <p>For women entrepreneurs, starting and sustaining a business in Alaska can pose special challenges.</p>

        <p>It's 9 a.m., the air temperature is 15, the Taku winds are blowing and the gun-smoke gray sky spews snow over Juneau. The February snow stacks up on the boat docks of Harris Harbor, but cannot match the knee-length brown rubber boots Laurie Lindsey wears.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lindsey, 50, climbs onto the Kirsten Anne, a 49-foot ketch that sleeps eight and has been around the world twice. She is a 50-year-old entrepreneur with short black hair, long earrings, a quick smile and few wrinkles, despite 20 years working outside and one failed business. She started as a cook on a crab boat that fished year-round on the Bering Sea and by the late 1980s, she and her husband at the time, Glenn Organ, had their own commercial fishing business.</p>
        <p>Credit card companies and banks categorized her as self-employed and in a high-risk business and would give her neither a credit card, nor a business loan. Then salmon prices plummeted and her company was sued by a crew member. ''We had a seaman's injury case,'' she recalls. ''It was fraudulent, but it took us over the edge, and we pretty much lost everything in 1993.''</p>
        <p>Five years later, Ms. Lindsey had recovered financially and started a new business on her own, a sailing charter that takes scientists and tourists around Southeast Alaska. Ms. Lindsey says being a woman business owner is easier now. ''Things have changed incredibly in the last 20 years.''</p>
        <p>Still, progress, especially in Alaska, has been slow. A December 2006 study by the Center for Women's Business Research in Washington, shows that in Alaska, women hold majority stakes in about 17,000 private enterprises. That is about 26 percent of all the state's businesses, and that puts Alaska toward the bottom nationwide when it comes to business ownership by women. By comparison, in Washington, 35 percent of all businesses are owned by women. In Maryland, and Hawaii they own almost one-third.</p>
        <p>Gwen Martin, the center's research director, points to the macho businesses that dominate Alaska's economy. ''The construction industry is huge, transportation and warehousing are big,'' she said. ''Those are fields dominated by men, and that may be one reason for fewer women-owned businesses.'' Nationwide, Ms. Martin says, women are starting to make inroads into these fields.</p>
        <p>Visitors like to compare Juneau to San Francisco, with its steep, winding streets and public staircases of hundreds of steps that lead to century-old clapboard cottages trimmed in pastels and clinging to a mountainside long ago settled by gold miners.</p>
        <p>A few blocks from the harbor, the historic Silverbow Inn is a European kind of place, a cultural center whose lobby has a mix of period photos and posters advertising arts events. It serves strong coffee, fresh bagels with salmon from a nearby smokehouse, shows independent films and is expanding.</p>
        <p>Jill Ramiel, formerly of New York, owns the Silverbow Inn with her husband, Ken Alper. Showing off a gallery space recently, while an electrician installed track lighting, Ms. Ramiel said she planned to display local artists and about 20 of them have inquired about the space.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, she came to Juneau from Seattle, after finishing a master's degree in architecture. At first, she said, she wanted to open a luncheonette, but fell in love with the 93-year-old structure, known as the Messerschmidt Building, and saw it as a bagel shop and inn. She was 29, though, and did not have much collateral or any experience making bagels, but had a notion of how small business worked. Her grandmother used to run a liquor store on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ramiel managed to persuade a local banker to lend her about $500,000 to buy the building and adjacent restaurant. In 2006, she went to the same banker and the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state lending agency, for $900,000 to upgrade and expand the inn's number of rooms to 11.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ramiel is surprised to hear that Alaska is tough for women entrepreneurs, but acknowledges that she is treated differently from her husband, who owns a minority stake in the business and runs it with her.</p>
        <p>''There's an expectation for me to wake up every day, put a smile on my face, and be chipper and supportive, even when things are going wrong all around me,'' she said. ''Sometimes I'm at my desk thinking about how to solve a problem and someone will walk by and say 'Smile,' but they wouldn't say that to my husband.''</p>
        <p>Finding workers has been a struggle. At the start, she imported friends with skills. One owned a bagel shop in Morristown, N.J. Ms. Ramiel went there for a month to see how to make a traditional-style bagel and persuaded her friend to pack up his family and move to Juneau. Another friend, a chef trained at a culinary school, moved from Seattle and worked the grill.</p>
        <p>''It's a smaller labor pool in Alaska,'' Ms. Ramiel said. ''Now we find people we like because of their attitude and then write job descriptions to fit their skills.'' For instance, the bagel maker is a college student who arrives whenever his schedule allows, often in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>Alaska is a giant state that spawns grand myths. One of them holds that men way outnumber women. In a few rural communities they do, but statewide the gender makeup is almost balanced. In Anchorage, women actually outnumber men, according to the 2005 American Community Survey. That has not made business any easier for Sharon Athas Cote, 43.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cote, reached by phone at her Anchorage headquarters, says she dislikes complaining about troubles women face winning contracts and was reluctant to become certified under the federal government's 8a procurement program. It is intended to give women and other disadvantaged entrepreneurs a leg up in bidding. Her construction and trucking business -- SBH Services -- qualifies because it is 51 percent owned by women. Having the status can make a big difference in Alaska, where federal contracts on military bases and for infrastructure projects add up to billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Then three years ago, Ms. Cote was bidding on a landscaping and construction job and went to interview for the project. ''I had to listen to the company owner lecture me for about a half an hour about how women were taking jobs away from men. He said for that reason, he wouldn't give me the work,'' she recalls.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cote walked out, called her husband and said she was going to apply for the preferential bidding status, which she now has. ''I try to differentiate myself through service, but the 8a status has opened a lot of doors for me.''</p>

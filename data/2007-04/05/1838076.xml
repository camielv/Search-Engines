        <p>A new collection of leaf-patterned rugs by Paul Mathieu, a French artist, for the company Odegard, includes four designs: two variations on oak leaves and two on acanthus (including Acanthe Dehors, below). Although Mr. Mathieu's designs are modern, he was inspired by the ''grand tradition'' of the knotted-pile ''Savonnerie style'' carpets popular with the aristocracy in late-17th-century France, he said. The rugs are made of hand-spun Himalayan wool and come in five standard sizes (from 4 by 6 feet to 10 by 14 feet), starting at $115 a square foot; they can be ordered in custom sizes as well. For information and showroom locations: (800) 670-8836 or odegardinc.com.</p>

        <p>The City Department of Investigation has arrested a supervisor at the Human Resources Administration on charges of diverting nearly $10,000 in public assistance to pay rent on her Bronx apartment, Investigation Department officials said yesterday. The employee, Cherie Heyward, 44, whose job included supervising a unit that processed authorizations for payments at the Rider Job Center, was involved in issuing 12 checks for $720 to $920 between October 2003 and March 2004, for a total of $9,786.91, the officials said. Those checks, they said, were ostensibly for Ms. Heyward's companion, a client of the job center, but went instead to Ms. Heyward's landlord. Ms. Heyward, who has been charged with third-degree grand larceny, faces up to seven years in prison.</p>

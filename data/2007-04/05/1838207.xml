        <p>Lawyers who filed a class-action lawsuit against Menu Foods, which recalled more than 90 brands of pet food last month, are alleging that the company knew the food was tainted but waited to recall it. The lawsuit, filed in Chicago on March 20 by a woman whose cat died after eating the food, is also seeking an injunction to keep Menu Foods from destroying contaminated food because it is evidence. Numerous other lawsuits have been filed against the company. The Food and Drug Administration said that it had received more than 10,000 complaints, and that tests of the food had found a chemical used to make plastic cutlery. A Menu Foods spokesman would not comment.</p>

        <p>Federal prosecutors have ended their investigation of whether William M. Bulger, the former president of the University of Massachusetts, thwarted efforts to find his fugitive brother, James, a mob figure charged with 21 murders, The Boston Globe reported Wednesday.</p>
        <p>A grand jury that was impaneled to investigate whether to charge William Bulger with perjury and obstruction of justice was allowed to expire, The Globe reported, because there was not enough evidence to bring charges.</p>
        <p>The investigation, The Globe said, was focused on grand jury testimony Mr. Bulger gave in 2001, in which he admitted to speaking with his brother and not urging him to turn himself into the authorities.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for United States attorney here, Michael Sullivan, refused to comment. Thomas Kiley, a lawyer for Mr. Bulger, would not confirm the report.</p>
        <p>''If the story is true, it brings some relief to a family that needs relief,'' Mr. Kiley said. ''The family has been pressured, and to have an alleviation of that is right, just and well put.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bulger, who served as president of the Massachusetts Senate for 17 years, resigned as president of the University of Massachusetts in 2003 amid criticism that he had been evasive in his testimony before Congress about his brother.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bulger, 72, told the House Government Reform Committee that he did not know his brother's whereabouts and had not aided him since he became a fugitive in 1995 after being tipped off that he was about to be indicted on charges of racketeering and murder. James Bulger, known as Whitey, is Boston's most infamous mob figure. He and an associate were charged with 21 murders in 2000.</p>
        <p>Another brother, John, was sentenced to six months in prison in 2003 for lying about contact with James Bulger.</p>

        <p>If at the first community board you don't succeed, try another one.</p>
        <p>That strategy paid off last night for Jerry Orbach's widow, Elaine, who has campaigned for several weeks to have a Midtown street corner renamed for her husband. Mr. Orbach, who died in late 2004, was a leading man on Broadway for many years before he played the seen-it-all detective Lennie Briscoe on NBC's ''Law &amp; Order.''</p>
        <p>After failing last month to persuade the members of Community Board 5 to support her quest, Mrs. Orbach looked westward across Eighth Avenue to Community Board 4. She was able to do that because the intersection she wanted renamed, where 53rd Street crosses Eighth Avenue, straddles the border of the two districts.</p>
        <p>Community Board 4 proved to be more accommodating, but not by much. Its members, like those of Community Board 5, have sworn off the New York tradition of ceremonially renaming streets, blocks and corners for dead celebrities and fallen heroes.</p>
        <p>Last night, after about 45 minutes of debate, the full community board voted to send a letter to the city's Department of Transportation endorsing the installation of a three-foot-long sign at the corner naming it Jerry Orbach Way. Mr. Orbach and his wife lived in an apartment on 53rd Street just west of the intersection for more than 25 years.</p>
        <p>''This community board seldom recommends named street signs,'' the board's letter says. ''However, we feel that in this instance it will illustrate the prominent role our neighborhood plays for Broadway and Off Broadway professionals in addition to celebrating Mr. Orbach as a much-loved neighbor.''</p>
        <p>But the feeling was far from unanimous at Community Board 4. The board's executive committee decided last week to reiterate its opposition to the renaming of streets and pushed for a vote on that resolution before the Orbach matter could come up. Then, at last night's meeting, the board considered a resolution to send the matter back to committee for reconsideration. In the end, it decided to give Mr. Orbach his due, though the City Council will have the final say. The Council almost always approves the community boards' nominations.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, the overwhelming feeling in the room was this was one that was a no-brainer,'' said James B. Fishman, a lawyer representing Mrs. Orbach.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't be more pleased,'' Mrs. Orbach said last night.</p>

        <p>8 P.M. (My Network TV) HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ELTON! -- Never mind the cake and candles: a celebration like this calls for a fireworks extravaganza. In honor of his 60th birthday and his record-breaking 60th concert at Madison Square Garden, Elton John, above, hams it up amid an explosion of confetti. Celebrities like Sharon Stone, Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne, Robin Williams, Whoopi Goldberg, Paul McCartney, the Beckhams and Mr. John's longtime collaborator, Bernie Taupin, salute the rocket man.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (History) SOMETHING ABOUT MARY MAGDALENE -- Was she a prostitute? Jesus' wife? The co-founder of Christianity? This special examines the wave of revisionism currently surrounding her.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Travel) 1,000 PLACES TO SEE BEFORE YOU DIE -- In this newish series inspired by Patricia Schultz's travel book, Albin and Melanie Ulle, newlyweds from Colorado, travel the world for 14 weeks. Tonight they check Oahu and the Big Island of Hawaii off their list.</p>
        <p>9:30 P.M. (MTV) NICK CANNON PRESENTS SHORT CIRCUITZ -- In ''Wild N' Out'' Mr. Cannon, left, was all about one-liners and improv raps. Now he puts a hip-hop spin on spoofs of television, news reports, commercials and celebrities with the help of comedians like Affion Crockett, Taran Killam, Leonard Robinson, Mikey Day, Eliza Coupe and Katt Williams. First up: ''Claymates,'' a music video by Ludacris, and ''The Negrotiator.''</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (13) A WAYFARER'S JOURNEY: LISTENING TO MAHLER -- Gustav Mahler once said that the purpose of art was ''deliverance and uplift from suffering.'' It's little wonder then that people have turned to his music to cope with travails. This special examines the therapeutic powers of his works through interviews with Christoph Eschenbach, music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, who talks about recovering from the trauma of World War II; Dr. Richard J. O'Reilly of Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, who describes how Mahler's works are used in therapy; and Dr. Balfour Mount, who discloses how music gives him courage to battle his own cancer. Mr. Eschenbach conducts students from the Curtis Institute of Music in Mahler's First Symphony. Richard Dreyfuss provides Mahler's voice; Kathleen Chalfant narrates.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Bravo) THE WORD ACCORDING TO WHOOPI -- She may be ''the oldest person in the room,'' as she says, but that doesn't mean Whoopi Goldberg, right, can't be trusted. Here she gets riled up on issues from racism to drugs and aging (no more free sex, no more wild parties) but still keeps things light.</p>
        <p>10:30 P.M. (Showtime) THIS AMERICAN LIFE -- Ira Glass looks both ways at the intersection where the faithful and the not-so cross paths, with unexpected results: the Mojave Desert, where Polaroid-toting believers gather each month in hope of seeing God, and a depiction of the Last Supper attended by an artist, a model impersonating Jesus, the model's atheist girlfriend and her religious father.</p>

        <p>You rarely realize your kitchen's running short of something until you are busy cooking -- and then, inevitably, the pencil for the shopping list is missing. Luckily, there's a gadget that will let you dictate it.</p>
        <p>Tap a button on the SmartShopper, state your needs to its built-in microphone, and speech-recognition software turns them into text. SmartShopper recognizes 2,500 item names and common errands (''dry cleaners,'' say, or ''post office''), and lets you add items of your own. It also displays each new entry so you can correct it. When you're going out to shop, it prints out the list, alphabetized, with errands followed by your list of things to get.</p>

        <p>Convince me. That's what many would think going to a musical linking Christ's passion with that of the hate-crime victim Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was beaten and left for dead in Laramie, Wyo., in 1998.</p>
        <p>And for the first few minutes ''Matthew Passion,'' which opened on Monday at the Chernuchin Theater, almost does. It opens with a theater director calling actors to tell them they've been cast; their responses are fresh and funny. When the director contacts the three members of the Greek Chorus, telling them theirs is a smaller role, they respond by popping into a single phrase of close-harmony song, ''It won't be small when we're through with it,'' deservedly drawing a laugh.</p>

        <p>Convince me. That's what many would think going to a musical linking Christ's passion with that of the hate-crime victim Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was beaten and left for dead in Laramie, Wyo., in 1998.</p>
        <p>And for the first few minutes ''Matthew Passion,'' which opened on Monday at the Chernuchin Theater, almost does. It opens with a theater director calling actors to tell them they've been cast; their responses are fresh and funny. When the director contacts the three members of the Greek Chorus, telling them theirs is a smaller role, they respond by popping into a single phrase of close-harmony song, ''It won't be small when we're through with it,'' deservedly drawing a laugh.</p>
        <p>But the play can't sustain its offbeat humor beneath the weight of all it has taken on. To the credit of Phil Hall, whose baby this is -- he wrote the text, the lyrics, and the music for the generally schmaltzy songs, and serves as the show's musical director and pianist in the six-man band -- the piece is well structured, weaving together three levels of story (Christ's, Matthew Shepard's and that of Jim, an actor who has been living with H.I.V., and survivor's guilt, for 20 years).</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall ties the whole thing together in the final scene, in which Matthew Shepard ascends through a crowd of angels to be welcomed in heaven by God, played by the voice of Jim the actor, who in this moment finds redemption.</p>
        <p>This scene also epitomizes the problems with ''Matthew Passion.'' It is brave of Mr. Hall to attempt something so openly spiritual, ambitious and naïve; he is seeking to establish a religious orthodoxy that can co-exist with a gay sensibility. But the play is not quite sure whether it wants to be camp or an Easter pageant: it has echoes of ''Angels in America'' without going so openly over the top, and at times seems to be a gay version of a biblical greeting card.</p>
        <p>The most compelling parts are the exchanges between Jim (played by an actor named Matthew Shepard) and various other men, all played by Jay Sullivan. In other words, the real heart of the piece is a real-life crisis of faith. This might come across just as clearly without the trappings of iconic stories of suffering in which the play has shrouded itself.</p>
        <p>''Matthew Passion'' continues through Sunday at the Chernuchin Theater, 314 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444.</p>

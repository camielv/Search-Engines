        <p>Introduced on Wednesday: Volvo XC70</p>
        <p>Is it real? Yes, live from Sweden, the XC70 is a genuine midsize wagon, with Volvo's new trapezoid-shape grille.</p>
        <p>What's the point? To satisfy tenured academics, the incurably safety-conscious and possibly the entire state of Vermont.</p>
        <p>What they said: "We've given the car a lot more character," Steve Mattin, Volvo's design director, said. Volvo spokesmen also touted the company's latest safety feature: a pair of booster seats in back with cushions that rise to either of two levels to fit children of different sizes.</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: The Volvo's spacious, tasteful interior is a close cousin of the S80's, the luxury sedan whose platform supports the XC70.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? The previous model's forgettable five-cylinder engine is replaced by the 232-horsepower, 3.2-liter in-line 6-cylinder from the S80 sedan, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. A fast-hauling R version is in the works, featuring the S80's optional, Yamaha-built 311-horsepower V-8.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? The XC70 goes on sale early next year, at a base price that should sneak a bit past $30,000.</p>
        <p>How's it look? Shapely and handsome, if you're the rare American with a thing for station wagons.</p>

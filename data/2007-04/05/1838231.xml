        <p>Introduced on Wednesday: Bentley Brooklands</p>
        <p>Is it real? Every inch of the imposing Bentley Brooklands coupe is real, including its $350,000 sticker price.</p>
        <p>What's the point? More proof that too much luxury is never enough. Only 550 Brooklands will be built; 150 of those are coming to America. Despite the nose-bleed price, the company said that the allotment for the United States is almost sold out.</p>
        <p>What they said: Stuart McCullough, board member for sales and marketing at Bentley, said that clients have free rein to customize their Brooklands. Mr. McCullough said that the only limitations are the customer's imagination and ability to pay for the work.</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: Ignoring the recent trend of green machines, Bentley wisely chose not to mention the fuel mileage of the Brooklands. No, there is no hybrid planned.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? A 530-horsepower variation of Bentley's 6.7-liter V-8 is under that mammoth hood.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? Apparently $350,000 is only the beginning. Mr. McCullough said that owners can request special paint, leather and, in the case of one Bentley Arnage buyer, even a specific tree. Located on the customer's estate, the noble oak was chopped down and used for the car's interior trim. The Brooklands officially arrives in early 2008.</p>
        <p>How's it look? If you love the square-jawed looks of lesser Bentleys, then you'll love the Brooklands coupe. Bigger and more brash than its siblings, the Brooklands is not a car for bashful billionaires.</p>

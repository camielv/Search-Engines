        <p>The death of a man who survived nearly 30 years after being paralyzed by a sniper was ruled a homicide yesterday after the city medical examiner found that he had died as a result of his wound. The man, Gilberto Medina, 70, died at home of an infection on March 21. On Oct. 25, 1977, he was shot on a Bronx street in what the police called a random act. He was hit in the spine, a wound that left him paralyzed from the waist down. No one was arrested in the case. The reclassification of Mr. Medina's death comes after several similar cases in which people died years after they were shot, stabbed or otherwise assaulted. There were 35 such reclassifications last year, the police said, roughly three times the historical average.</p>

        <p>The Yankees called off yesterday's 1 p.m. game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays because of rain, postponing Andy Pettitte's return to Yankee Stadium. No makeup date was announced.</p>
        <p>''I heard it's going to be maybe 20- or 30-mile-an-hour winds,'' Pettitte said in the clubhouse yesterday, after his start was pushed back a day. ''You never want to deal with wind, because that's usually the thing that'll give you trouble with your command. That's the important thing that I'm thinking about -- hopefully it's not too, too windy out there.''</p>

        <p>Manager Joe Torre said Pettitte would pitch tonight. In a home series with the Baltimore Orioles this weekend, the Yankees will start Mike Mussina tomorrow, Kei Igawa on Saturday and Darrell Rasner on Sunday. Carl Pavano will pitch Monday in Minnesota.</p>

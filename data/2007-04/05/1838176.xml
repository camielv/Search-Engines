        <p>FORD STICKING WITH THE PLAN The Ford Motor Company's chief executive, Alan R.

''We see this year as a year when we start clawing back our production,'' said Basil E. Omiyi, above, Shell's managing director for Nigeria. ''I don't see anything standing in our way of restarting our production.'' [C1.]</p>
        <p>UNION TRUST TAKEN TO COURT A lawsuit filed in federal court contends that a retirement plan offered by a federation of New York teachers unions accepted millions of dollars from an investment firm in exchange for endorsing the firm's products. [C1.]</p>
        <p>GAZPROM IN DEAL FOR YUKOS ASSETS Two Italian energy companies won an auction for assets of the bankrupt Yukos oil company, then promptly announced they would sell most of the assets to the state-owned Russian gas giant Gazprom. [C3.]</p>
        <p>LONE STAR'S EXIT STRATEGY? Lone Star Funds, the private equity firm embroiled in a dispute with South Korean prosecutors, said that it would divest itself of two of its Korean holdings, fueling speculation that it would exit the country. [C12.]</p>
        <p>UNIVERSITIES AND LOAN COMPANIES The directors of financial aid offices at Columbia University, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Southern California profited from the sale of shares they held in a student loan company, which each of the universities recommends to student borrowers, according to an investigation by Andrew M. Cuomo, New York attorney general. [A1.]</p>
        <p>YOUTUBE BLOCKED IN THAILAND Thailand's government blocked access to YouTube because of a video clip that denigrated the country's monarch. Google refused to remove the clip. [C12.]</p>
        <p>A BONUS (ONLINE) ISSUE The newsmagazine The Week will publish an extra issue online, rather than in its regular printed format. The issue will focus on the environment -- hence the decision to spare trees. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C4.]</p>
        <p>AN ALL-GREEN TV CHANNEL Discovery Communications, the cable channel operator, plans to start a 24-hour channel focused on eco-friendly living, as part of a push into the rising environmental movement. [C3.]</p>
        <p>SEEKING OPPORTUNITY IN ALASKA For women entrepreneurs, starting and sustaining a business in Alaska can pose special challenges. Small Business. [C11.]</p>
        <p>MARKETS EDGE HIGHER Stocks advanced slightly, as oil prices dropped and economic data offered little incentive to buyers. [C14.]</p>
        <p>HINTS OF A WEAKENING ECONOMY Growth in the service sector fell to a four-year low last month while the job market showed only modest improvement, according to reports that reinforced views of a weakening economy. [C3.]</p>
        <p>A GOOD QUARTER FOR BEST BUY The Best Buy Company, the nation's biggest consumer electronics chain, reported an increase of 18.5 percent in its quarterly profit. Its rival, Circuit City Stores, swung to a loss of $12.2 million, as it continued to struggle with charges related in part to store closings. [C12.]</p>
        <p>NOT YOUR NORMAL W-2 Google paid its top executive, Eric E. Schmidt, a salary of $1 and a holiday bonus of $1,723 in 2006, according to a regulatory filing. But Mr. Schmidt's personal security cost shareholders $532,755, representing the bulk of his compensation. [C3.]</p>
        <p>GOOD MORNING. YOU'RE REPLACED. CNN, disappointed with ratings for its news program ''American Morning,'' is replacing the anchor team of Soledad O'Brien and Miles O'Brien and installing Kieran Chetry and the former CBS News correspondent John Roberts. [E10.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>PAY FOR PERFORMANCE? At many companies, changes in chief executives' pay last year roughly corresponded with changes in their shareholders' total return.

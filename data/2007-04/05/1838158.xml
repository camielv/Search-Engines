        <p>Seductive forces abound in New York City: music, bars, food, money, power. And the No. 1 train, of course, though some people think the D train is really hot.</p>
        <p>Subways and sex? Apparently so.</p>
        <p>In just a month, the city gave away five million of its new subway-themed condoms, officials said yesterday. Lest you read past that number unimpressed, consider that that was about two condoms for every man living in the city -- more than the city distributed in all of 2003.</p>
        <p>This condom was the first designed just for the city, in a wrapper with lettering mimicking the logos of subway lines. First released on Valentine's Day, the new condom exceeded all expectations, with five million sent out by mid-March.</p>
        <p>''I think the key thing is this branding effort,'' said Adam Karpati, the assistant city health commissioner in charge of H.I.V. and AIDS programs. ''It's our own brand, it's a New York City-specific thing, and people really respond.''</p>
        <p>The city began giving away condoms in 1971, but for decades they were available only in city-run health clinics and from H.I.V. service groups. But a few years ago, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene began recruiting bars, restaurants, block associations, theaters, shops, doctors' offices and even churches to hand out the condoms.</p>
        <p>Last year, with the help of 877 such partners, the department distributed 18 million condoms, compared with about 4 million distributed in 2003. Since it announced the city's own brand, promoted by an ad campaign, 500 new groups have joined the effort, Dr. Karpati said.</p>
        <p>Now, the subway condom has led the city into temptation -- the temptation to use as many suggestive puns as it can.</p>
        <p>The city's posters advertising the condoms proclaim ''we've got you covered,'' and ''New York's hottest new wrapper.'' A press release yesterday said, ''the rubber is hitting the road,'' although it probably should have said ''railroad.''</p>
        <p>So will the department choose a new, sexy theme to evoke the city's peculiar appeal? Bridges and tunnels? Bagels?</p>
        <p>''People have made that suggestion to us,'' Dr. Karpati said. ''The possibilities are endless, and so are the double entendres.''</p>

        <p>Editorial says dispute between Ukrainian Pres Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Min Viktor Yanukovich should be settled in courts, not with violence; says Yushchenko's desperate disbanding of Parliament because he lost his parliamentary majority to Yanukovich supporters may not be constitutional; urges two leaders to compromise</p>

        <p>Once again, the streets of Kiev are filling with two bitterly opposed Ukrainian political camps. The cast is the same as in 2004 -- the westward-leaning Viktor Yushchenko versus the Russia-leaning Viktor Yanukovich. But this time it's not clear that Mr. Yushchenko has the moral high ground, as he did in 2004, when he won an election and Mr. Yanukovich tried to steal it. This time, Mr. Yushchenko lost his parliamentary majority and is trying to get it back in a way that may not be legal. This is a dispute that needs to be settled in the courts, not the streets.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Yushchenko took the desperate step of declaring that he was dissolving Parliament and calling new elections, in hopes of eroding the majority held in the legislature by his opponents. But it is not clear that he has the constitutional authority to do that. Mr. Yanukovich cried foul and declared he would not obey. The wisest move for the West, and for Russia, is to urge compromise.</p>

        <p>Once again, the streets of Kiev are filling with two bitterly opposed Ukrainian political camps.

This time, Mr. Yushchenko lost his parliamentary majority and is trying to get it back in a way that may not be legal. This is a dispute that needs to be settled in the courts, not the streets.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Yushchenko took the desperate step of declaring that he was dissolving Parliament and calling new elections, in hopes of eroding the majority held in the legislature by his opponents. But it is not clear that he has the constitutional authority to do that. Mr. Yanukovich cried foul and declared he would not obey. The wisest move for the West, and for Russia, is to urge compromise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yushchenko's vision of anchoring Ukraine and its 50 million people in the West, economically and politically, is far more attractive than Mr. Yanukovich's Soviet-era politics. But Mr. Yushchenko's stormy tenure as president has demonstrated that Ukraine remains deeply divided and has only begun to shape effective political institutions.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Yushchenko's most compelling reforms was to transfer some of the powers of the president to Parliament, in the hope of avoiding the all-powerful presidencies that have evolved in Russia and some other former Soviet republics. That allowed Mr. Yanukovich to gather ever greater strength in Parliament by luring deputies away from Mr. Yushchenko. The two men then became locked in a dispute over Mr. Yushchenko's powers under the Constitution, and Mr. Yanukovich asked the Constitutional Court for a ruling.</p>
        <p>That could take months. And even if there are new elections, it is far from clear that Mr. Yushchenko and his allies would get more seats than Mr. Yanukovich and his camp. Mr. Yushchenko's ratings have been steadily slipping, and strong economic growth over the past year could strengthen Mr. Yanukovich.</p>
        <p>But that's the nature of politics, and it is up to the two leaders to make certain their followers understand that. The worst-case scenario would be if the confrontation was left to the streets.</p>

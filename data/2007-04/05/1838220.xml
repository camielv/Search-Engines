        <p>A man was fatally shot yesterday morning in South Ozone Park after transferring money to Caribbean relatives at a check-cashing store, the police and his companion said. The man, Courtney Atkinson, 51, who worked as a skycap at the Delta Airlines terminal at Kennedy International Airport, left his home on 126th Street around 11 a.m. to cash his paycheck and forward the money to relatives in Jamaica, according to his companion, Novette Facey. He was returning to the store, on Rockaway Boulevard, after realizing that he had made an error in the transfer, Ms. Facey said. The police said he was shot once in the chest on his way to or from the store. Ms. Facey, 38, who is the mother of three of his children, said she became concerned when he did not return home, and went outside to look for him. She discovered his body, covered by a sheet, lying on their street. The police said that they did not know if robbery had been the motive, and that there were no arrests as of last night. Ms. Facey described Mr. Atkinson as a hardworking man and kind father who liked nothing better than to set a pot of chicken-foot soup on the stove and kick back to reggae and calypso music. She cried as she said: ''I loved him. I don't know how I'm going to live without him.''</p>

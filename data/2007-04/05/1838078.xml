        <p>If you are the kind of person who forgets to water the plants, Rain Bird's Time-Release Water offers an effortless, if somewhat unattractive, solution. A gel made of 98 percent water and 2 percent cellulose, it was developed 10 years ago for parkland use and was recently introduced to the consumer market. It comes in a tube that sits near the plant's roots. Over time -- 30 days in the case of the 9-ounce package ($1.18), above, or 90 days if you buy the 32-ounce container ($2.06) -- the bacteria and enzymes in the soil break down the cellulose, releasing the water, said Randy Hall, a product manager for the company. After the gel has dissolved, the tube can be replaced. Or you could pick up a watering can.</p>

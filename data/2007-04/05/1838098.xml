        <p>Editorial says feverish fund-raising for 2008 presidential race is casting front-runners prematurely based on ability to raise cash; says nation needs alternative of limited public financing; calls on candidates to join Sens Barack Obama and John McCain in pledging to embrace public finance limits in 2008 general election</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>At least one of the presidential candidates making the first feverish dash of the 2008 fund-raising derby felt obliged to describe the tastelessness of the race. ''I'm raising obscene amounts of money,'' said Senator Barack Obama, hardly pausing on his way to piling up a first-round total of $25 million.</p>
        <p>This is already a record-breaking campaign for the sheer volume of money it is generating. It also is setting a new low with a ludicrously premature handicapping of the race based on the ability to raise cash. It is 19 months before the election, and the quarterly fund-raising data were treated this week like the dawning of poll results from Dixville Notch, N.H.</p>

        <p>At least one of the presidential candidates making the first feverish dash of the 2008 fund-raising derby felt obliged to describe the tastelessness of the race. ''I'm raising obscene amounts of money,'' said Senator Barack Obama, hardly pausing on his way to piling up a first-round total of $25 million.</p>
        <p>This is already a record-breaking campaign for the sheer volume of money it is generating. It also is setting a new low with a ludicrously premature handicapping of the race based on the ability to raise cash. It is 19 months before the election, and the quarterly fund-raising data were treated this week like the dawning of poll results from Dixville Notch, N.H.</p>
        <p>All this in a race that is supposed to be a different sort of competition -- if not of ideas, then at least of personalities and positions.</p>
        <p>This is not just another example of picking a winner before a vote is cast. This year, the political industry is spinning the money before it is spent, ordaining mega-fund-raising as the sine qua non of a credible candidacy. Dispatches heralded ''the winners of the first presidential fund-raising race,'' pronouncing one big $20 million raiser (Mitt Romney) as instantly ''formidable'' and a ''rising force'' in the campaign, while discounting a more familiar aspirant (Senator John McCain) as ''lackluster'' and ''anemic'' for showing at a mere $12.5 million.</p>
        <p>If only voters' optimism about the nation and the political system could rise in direct proportion to the money stacks.</p>
        <p>The one thing established by the private fund-raising binge is that the nation needs the alternative of limited public financing as a rational option for seeking the presidency just as much as when it was enacted in response to the Watergate era of big-money corruption. Successive Congresses have failed to update the dollar limitations of the public financing law, inviting private donors to fully regain the upper hand in this presidential sweepstakes.</p>
        <p>Senator Hillary Clinton, hailed as a Democratic champ with an opening $26 million kitty, did take a moment for an ''if elected'' promise to seek eventual repair of the public financing system. Why not start now by signing on as a co-sponsor of the excellent proposal already in the Senate hopper to upgrade the limits in time for the 2012 election?</p>
        <p>And why shouldn't all the candidates join Senators Obama and McCain in pledging to go halfway toward sanity by embracing public finance limits in next year's general election, providing both final candidates agree?</p>
        <p>That would at least suggest a heartbeat still exists for public financing among the money political class.</p>

        <p>The Vatican announced the release of Benedict XVI's first book as pope, ''Jesus of Nazareth,'' to be issued in Italian, German and Polish on his 80th birthday, April 16. The book is the first of two volumes on the life of Jesus Christ, which he has said he began working on in 2003, while still a cardinal. In an excerpt printed in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Benedict drew modern-day lessons from the Parable of the Good Samaritan, saying that rich nations that had ''plundered and sacked'' Africa had an obligation to help the world's poor.</p>

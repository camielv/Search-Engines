        <p>Nikolaj Hübbe to Lead Danish Ballet</p>
        <p>Nikolaj Hübbe, a longtime principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, has been appointed artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet from July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2012, and has been named the company's principal stage director from Aug. 1, 2007, to June 30, 2008. Mr. Hübbe, who was born in Copenhagen, began his training in 1978 at the Royal Danish Theater Ballet School, was appointed a principal dancer at the Royal Danish Ballet in 1988 and joined the City Ballet in 1992. Mad Ovlisen, chairman of the board of the Royal Danish Ballet, said, ''Nikolaj Hübbe is an obvious choice as artistic director.'' He succeeds Frank Andersen, who had announced he was leaving.</p>
        <p>Peabody Award Winners</p>
        <p>A ''60 Minutes'' report by Ed Bradley that led to reconsideration of the rape charges against members of the Duke University lacrosse team was among 35 winners of the 66th Annual Peabody Awards announced yesterday by the University of Georgia's Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. Other winners include ''ABC News Brian Ross Investigates'' broadcasts and Web postings about sexually explicit e-mail messages from Representative Mark Foley, a Florida Republican, to young Congressional pages; the HBO documentary ''Baghdad E.R.'' about a military combat hospital in Iraq; the PBS ''American Masters'' presentation of ''Andy Warhol: A Documentary Film''; and the BBC-National Geographic nature film ''Galapagos: Born of Fire.'' Entertainment series chosen for prizes included NBC's ''Friday Night Lights,'' about football in a small Texas town, and ABC's ''Ugly Betty.'' Presentations will be on June 4 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, where the sportscaster Bob Costas will be master of ceremonies. The awards recognize distinguished achievement and meritorious public service by stations, networks, producing organizations and individuals.</p>
        <p>Keith Richards Kidding, Spokeswoman Says</p>
        <p>No dad, poor dad, was ingested along with cocaine by the rocker Keith Richards, below, a spokeswoman said yesterday, Reuters reported. The denial came after Mr. Richards, 63, a member of the Rolling Stones, told the British magazine NME in an interview that he had snorted the cremated ashes of his father mixed with some cocaine. His father, Bert, died at 84 in 2002. The spokeswoman had no further comment on why Mr. Richards had made the statement. A spokeswoman for the magazine said late Tuesday, after his remarks were first reported, that they had been genuine and not a joke.</p>
        <p>Impac Award Finalists</p>
        <p>Salman Rushdie of Britain, Cormac McCarthy and Jonathan Safran Foer of the United States and J. M. Coetzee of South Africa made it to the shortlist of eight contenders yesterday for the $135,500 International Impac Dublin Literary Award, billed as the world's richest prize for a single work of fiction, Reuters reported. Other finalists are Per Petterson of Norway, Peter Hobbs and Julian Barnes of Britain and Sebastian Barry of Ireland. The winner will be announced in Dublin on June 14.</p>
        <p>Country Singer Surrenders</p>
        <p>The country singer Billy Joe Shaver surrendered on Tuesday in connection with a weekend shooting in a Texas bar and was released after posting $50,000 bail, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Shaver, 67, was charged with assault and a weapons violation. His lawyer, Joseph A. Turner, said Mr. Shaver had acted in self-defense when he shot a drunken, aggressive stranger who had a knife after being followed from a bar in Lorena, Tex., about 80 miles north of Austin. The victim was said to have been shot in the cheek.</p>
        <p>Footnote</p>
        <p>NBC announced yesterday that it would renew the comedy series ''30 Rock,'' starring Alec Baldwin and Jane Krakowski, for the 2007-8 season . ''Spider-Man 3,'' directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, will have its United States premiere as part of the Tribeca Film Festival, where it will be shown on April 30 at the UA Kaufman Astoria in Queens, the home borough of Peter Parker, whose alter ego is the superhero.</p>

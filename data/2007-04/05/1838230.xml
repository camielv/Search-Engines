        <p>Introduced on Wednesday: Lexus LX570</p>
        <p>Is it real? As real as an old-school fuel-thirsty body-on-frame luxury S.U.V. can be.</p>
        <p>What's the point? To avoid losing a relatively small but loyal contingent of big-S.U.V. buyers. Owners of the previous model, the LX470, have a household income of about $340,000; surprisingly, that's nearly double the average income of buyers of the flagship LS sedan.</p>
        <p>What they said: "Yes, the large-S.U.V. market is challenged right now, but this is a product that some customers really want, and we have to offer something for them," Mike Michels, a Toyota spokesman, said.</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: The Lexus LX570 presages the next-generation Toyota Land Cruiser, which will make its way to dealerships before long.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? The whomping V-8 engine from the Toyota Tundra pickup, with 381 horsepower, 111 more than the outgoing model. Besides 10 air bags and every imaginable off-road technology, the Lexus' luxury package features trim made from bubinga trees, a wood used in harps, pianos and swanky private jets.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? The LX570 rolls into dealerships early next year, most likely starting around $66,000-$69,000.</p>
        <p>How's it look? Square and sturdy, but not as stylish as a Range Rover or as imposing as a Cadillac Escalade.</p>

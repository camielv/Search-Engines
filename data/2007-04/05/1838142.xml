        <p>Lone Star Funds, the private equity firm based in Dallas, said on Wednesday that it would divest itself of two of its South Korean holdings -- a construction company and a leasing company -- fueling speculation it was planning to exit the country.</p>
        <p>Lone Star remains embroiled in a dispute with South Korean prosecutors over its majority stake in Korea Exchange Bank, which prosecutors said had been acquired illegally at a low price.</p>
        <p>In November, the dispute forced Lone Star to scrap a deal to sell the stake to Kookmin Bank of South Korea for an estimated $7.3 billion.</p>
        <p>Lone Star said the decision to auction the two holdings, StarLease and Kukdong Engineering and Construction, was a business decision.</p>
        <p>''As the companies have been restructured, it is now time for them to be sold to a strategic buyer,'' the chairman of Lone Star, John Grayken, said. ''This is a very normal and usual step in the investment cycle of a private equity fund.''</p>
        <p>The fund has hired ABN Amro to handle the sales in South Korea. Lone Star will retain its largest asset in the country -- Korea Exchange Bank -- as well as real estate and loan portfolios.</p>
        <p>Lone Star has complained that it is a victim of ''politically motivated'' prosecution amid rising public antagonism toward foreign investors.</p>

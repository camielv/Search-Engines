        <p>After a dismal first quarter, music sales showed signs of life last week, with seven new albums in the Top 10. The country star Tim McGraw, above, with ''Let It Go'' (Curb), is No. 1 with 325,000 copies sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan. That qualifies as one of the biggest openings of the year, though ''Let It Go'' moved less than half what Mr. McGraw's last studio album, ''Live Like You Were Dying,'' did in its debut week three years ago. Volume 24 of the pop compilation series ''Now That's What I Call Music!'' reached No. 2 with 230,000 purchases; the rapper Young Buck bowed at No. 3 with 140,000 sales of ''Buck the World'' (Interscope); and another rapper, Mims, moved 78,000 copies of ''Music Is My Savior'' (Universal) to open at No. 4. Good Charlotte's new ''Good Morning Revival'' (Epic) reached No. 7, Elton John's compilation ''Rocket Man: Number Ones'' (Island) is No. 9, and Jennifer Lopez's new Spanish-language album, ''Como Ama una Mujer'' (Epic), is No. 10. Last week's chart-topper, Modest Mouse's ''We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank'' (Epic), fell to No. 11 with 48,000 sales, a 64 percent decline.</p>

        <p>A corner of Astoria, Queens, that already has a pair of funky clothing stores (Loveday 31 and Candy Plum) has just gained the home-design equivalent. Mackenzi Farquer, above, a 28-year-old Chicagoan who graduated from the New York School of Interior Design, took over a former garage across the street from Kaufman Astoria Studios, tore out a dropped ceiling to discover a skylight and filled the space with inexpensive furnishings like a vintage yellow table lamp ($68), top, and old dining chairs that she and her mother repainted ($140 each), above left.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farquer's feet are resting on a Saarinen-inspired tweed covered stool ($160). The old mercury glass lamp, above right, is $145, and the mirrored bird coat hooks, above left, just $15. ''I think they're most adorable if you hang a flock,'' Ms. Farquer said. Site Design, 35-11 34th Ave., Astoria, sitedesignnyc.com.</p>

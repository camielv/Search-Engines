        <p>Introduced on Wednesday: Hyundai Genesis concept</p>
        <p>Is it real? Though it is technically a design study, Concept Genesis, as Hyundai calls its looks "very much like the production version" that is on the way.</p>
        <p>What's the point? Hyundai has been flirting with the idea of offering premium models for some time. The Genesis would be the Lexus level of Hyundai's lineup.</p>
        <p>What they said: "This is not just a concept car," said Steve Wilhite, chief operating officer of Hyundai Motor America. "It's really a fast-forward journey into the future of the Hyundai brand."</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: The first Lexus LS was a screaming bargain that trumped everything else in the premium segment on price and features. A Lexus is no longer such a bargain, but the Genesis would be a Lexuslike bargain with a wide array of standard features, if Hyundai sticks to the promises made here in terms of performance and price.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? Genesis, a rear-wheel-drive sedan, will feature Hyundai's first V-8 engine; horsepower output is promised to be "well over 300."</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? Second half of 2008, with a promised price "well under $30,000." Well, well.</p>
        <p>How's it look? Bigger than the Lexus GS, smaller than the LS, the photogenic Genesis in person looks more like the current Toyota Camry from the front, a Nissan Maxima from the side a Buick from behind.</p>

        <p>Cable subscribers will once again be able to watch out-of-market Major League Baseball games, ending their fears that the Extra Innings package would become the exclusive domain of DirecTV for the next seven years.</p>
        <p>M.L.B. and InDemand -- a consortium that is owned by the cable operators Comcast, Time Warner and Cox -- agreed last night to restore Extra Innings swiftly to their systems as a free preview through sometime next week, after which it will cost a discounted $159 for a short period.</p>

        <p>Cable subscribers will once again be able to watch out-of-market Major League Baseball games, ending their fears that the Extra Innings package would become the exclusive domain of DirecTV for the next seven years.</p>
        <p>M.L.B. and InDemand -- a consortium that is owned by the cable operators Comcast, Time Warner and Cox -- agreed last night to restore Extra Innings swiftly to their systems as a free preview through sometime next week, after which it will cost a discounted $159 for a short period.</p>
        <p>InDemand will make the package available today to other cable operators like Cablevision and Charter, who must make individual deals.</p>
        <p>The Dish Network, DirecTV's satellite rival, has not made a deal. ''No one is locked out,'' said Tim Brosnan, an executive vice president of M.L.B. But Dish said in a statement that baseball's terms were too costly and that it was not optimistic that it could reach a fair deal.</p>
        <p>The crucial part of the negotiations for baseball was InDemand's agreement to carry the MLB Channel, which is to make its debut in 2009.</p>
        <p>Between the deals made with DirecTV and InDemand, baseball said the channel will have 40 million subscribers when it starts. ''We believe we have a compelling product that our fans are passionate about,'' Brosnan said.</p>
        <p>Robert D. Jacobson, InDemand's president, said: ''We're very comfortable with the deal. We feel we were treated very fairly related to DirecTV.''</p>
        <p>The InDemand partnership received an equity stake of a little below 20 percent in the MLB Channel, which is about equal to DirecTV's.</p>
        <p>M.L.B. will receive an average of $100 million a year through 2013 for the Extra Innings rights from DirecTV and cable operators. The size of their yearly payments will be reduced if Dish negotiates its own deal.</p>
        <p>Baseball will benefit further from its majority share of the estimated $120 million in annual gross subscriber fees that the channel will generate.</p>

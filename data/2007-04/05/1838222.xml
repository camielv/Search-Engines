        <p>A report released yesterday by the Environmental Protection Agency found no evidence of discrimination against the people who live near a site where several proposed cleanups under the Superfund program had failed. Senators Robert Menendez and Frank R. Lautenberg and Representative Frank Pallone Jr. had asked the agency's inspector general to investigate allegations that the agency had neglected the residential area near the Ringwood Mines -- where the Ford Motor Company dumped paint sludge from its plant in Mahwah for many years -- because the area was populated by Ramapough Indians. The report said that ''problems with communications'' hurt cooperation between the agency and residents and recommended improving relations. The lawmakers criticized the report and asked the agency to study the treatment of residents more fully.</p>

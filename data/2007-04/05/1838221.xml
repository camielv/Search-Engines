        <p>The city is reviving a long dormant program to help postal workers alert the authorities when they suspect that a homebound or elderly person needs assistance, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday. Under the program, the city would provide the elderly and those with disabilities with special stickers, or magnets, to place in their mailboxes. If mail piled up in those boxes, mail deliverers could alert supervisors, who would report through 311 that a resident might be in distress. Workers at the Department for the Aging would then try to get in touch with the person's emergency contact or visit the home. Residents can register for the program through 311.</p>

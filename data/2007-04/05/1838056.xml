        <p>FASHION is like sudoku. For designers, it's a constant challenge of solving the same old problem. And for stores, it's always a numbers game.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Gap Inc. made a series of fashion goofs that spiraled into a mess of gloomy financials and management purges. For a chain that makes basic khakis and T-shirts its stock in trade, staying fresh has become an eternal puzzle. What, after all, can one do to liven up a basic white button-down shirt?</p>
        <p>Actually, a lot. This month the Gap will introduce limited-edition shirts designed by Doo-Ri Chung, Thakoon Panichgul and Laura and Kate Mulleavy of Rodarte, all winners of a fashion contest organized by the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue magazine.</p>
        <p>The project is meant to promote the careers of emerging talent, though the Gap could stand to benefit from what could be described as the Target effect -- the excitement of offering designer shirts for $68 to $88. Doo.Ri, Thakoon and Rodarte are labels with resonance among fashion followers, and their takes on the Gap classic, to those customers, will be interesting.</p>
        <p>''It was a good challenge,'' Mr. Panichgul said. ''What I try to do in my collection is to add an interesting twist or a witty take on a classic, and that is what this project is about as well: to be able to breathe life into a shirt with fresh, new, witty ideas.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Panichgul gave a patchwork effect to a shirt with ruffles, pin tucks and lantern sleeves; another he made into a shirtdress with a tiered skirt like the petal dresses of his signature collection. Ms. Chung's versions included a more severe camp shirt and a full mumsy shirtdress. The Mulleavys prettied up the season's trapeze shape with bow details.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chung envisioned a camp shirt with a shawl of layered panels, but the effect ultimately had to be made with neat pleats. The Gap also had a stock pattern to make a shirtdress. But she split that pattern in half, added more volume and shortened the sleeves.</p>
        <p>''It ended up looking very Claire McCardell,'' she said, ''which was not intentional, but I liked the way it looked.''</p>
        <p>They may not be providing the Gap with all the answers, but at least they're giving a clue.</p>

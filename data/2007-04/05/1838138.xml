        <p>As president for marketing at Miramax, Mr. Rice was involved with the promotion of Oscar contenders like ''The Cider House Rules'' and ''Chocolat.''</p>
        <p>The appointment is a significant step in the plan by United Artists to contribute as many as six films a year to the release schedule of the associated Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. The films include the expected November release of ''Lions for Lambs,'' a political thriller that is being directed by Robert Redford and will star Mr. Redford, Mr. Cruise and Meryl Streep.</p>

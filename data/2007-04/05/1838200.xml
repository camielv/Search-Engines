        <p>Melinda Doolittle drew another round of praise on Fox's ''American Idol'' as the network dominated Tuesday with more than twice the viewers of its closest competitor. According to Nielsen's estimates, 25.7 million viewers tuned in to ''American Idol'' at 8 p.m. Following it, ''House'' at 9 attracted 21 million viewers of its own. CBS ranked second for the night ahead of ABC, whose ''Dancing With the Stars'' results show garnered 14.6 million viewers at 9. Among adults 18 to 49, ABC shared third with NBC, which led the 10 p.m. hour with ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' (11.2 million). In the cable news race, the three leading channels all posted improvements in the first quarter of 2007 compared with the same period a year ago. MSNBC, in third place, showed the largest percentage increases, particularly in prime time, where it saw a 37 percent jump in total viewers (from 353,000 to 485,000). Fox News remained far ahead in first, averaging 1.5 million viewers in prime time, and CNN finished a solid second (759,000). Comedy Central also earned its best first quarter in the network's history, averaging of 1.1 million total viewers.</p>

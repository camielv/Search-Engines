        <p>''Home Design in New York City,'' a conference at the Museum of the City of New York on April 14, promises a glimpse inside some of the city's most famous residences -- among them, John D. Rockefeller's apartment (Michael Gross, center at bottom right, the author of ''740 Park: The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building,'' will discuss its ''oil money look'') and Sister Parish's numerous interiors (the designer Mario Buatta, bottom left, will explain how they convey what he calls an ''automatically civilized'' look, as if the owners had been in residence for years). Other participants include the curators Donald Albrecht and Thomas Mellins and, right from top, the designers Cristina Grajales and Jamie Drake and the architect Richard Sammons. Images like the 1936 photo of a Park Avenue apartment, top left, from the Samuel Gottscho Collection, will be on display. The Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue (103rd Street), (212) 534-1672 or mcny.org.</p>

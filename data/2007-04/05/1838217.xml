        <p>A 35-year-old man fatally stabbed his 67-year-old father last night in a parked S.U.V. as his mother watched from the back seat, the police and witnesses said. The victim, Ying Du of Flushing, Queens, was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan, where he was declared dead on arrival, the police said. The son was taken into custody for questioning and a knife was recovered at the scene. The S.U.V., a Nissan Pathfinder, was parked in front of 64 West 37th Street, where the family business, Phoenix Jewelry, is situated, according to neighbors. Mr. Du was sitting in the passenger seat and his son was in the driver's seat when they began arguing shortly after 6 p.m., witnesses said. The son took out a pocket knife and stabbed his father in the torso, the police said. A store owner who witnessed the arrest said the suspect ''was pretty catatonic, comatose'' and ''was obviously in shock.''</p>

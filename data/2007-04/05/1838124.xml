        <p>Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian who was trying to plant explosives in the northern Gaza Strip on Wednesday, Palestinian and Israeli officials said. It was the second clash in a week in the area near Beit Hanoun, a site from which rockets have frequently been fired toward Israel, despite a tenuous cease-fire since November.</p>
        <p>An Israeli Army spokesman said that three men had been spotted putting a bomb near the fence between Israel and Gaza. The Israeli troops opened fire, then the militants detonated two explosives, the spokesman said. It was unclear whether the explosives had caused any damage, but the spokesman said no soldiers had been wounded. The militant group Islamic Jihad, which does not participate in the cease-fire, claimed responsibility for the bombs in a statement.</p>

        <p>Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian who was trying to plant explosives in the northern Gaza Strip on Wednesday, Palestinian and Israeli officials said. It was the second clash in a week in the area near Beit Hanoun, a site from which rockets have frequently been fired toward Israel, despite a tenuous cease-fire since November.</p>
        <p>An Israeli Army spokesman said that three men had been spotted putting a bomb near the fence between Israel and Gaza. The Israeli troops opened fire, then the militants detonated two explosives, the spokesman said. It was unclear whether the explosives had caused any damage, but the spokesman said no soldiers had been wounded. The militant group Islamic Jihad, which does not participate in the cease-fire, claimed responsibility for the bombs in a statement.</p>
        <p>Palestinian hospital officials said that the man who was killed, Ramin Zaaneen, 23, was in Israeli custody for an hour and then was taken to the hospital. Reports said he died there. Israeli officials said they could not confirm that the man had been in their custody.</p>
        <p>At least one other gunman was wounded, though his condition was unclear. Palestinian hospital officials said a farmer was also wounded in the cross-fire, but Israeli officials said they could not confirm that. Another gunman escaped without injury, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Israeli Army officials said that they had entered Gaza during the episode, but only briefly to check for bombs, and that they did not consider the move an incursion or a breach of their cease-fire in the area. Israel withdrew its military and evacuated all Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip in summer 2005.</p>
        <p>''The soldiers went in for a limited period only after the gunmen fired at them,'' the spokesman for the Israeli military said.</p>
        <p>Tensions in Gaza have been rising in recent weeks, with some Israeli officials saying that militants there have been rearming. Amir Peretz, Israel's defense minister, said that the army should take ''decisive action'' to stop attacks from the area.</p>
        <p>Last week, Israel fired into northern Gaza for the first time since the November cease-fire. It said that its target was a militant cell that was about to launch a rocket at Israel.</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>United Airlines has dismissed Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, which created campaigns for the airline since 1996, and awarded its creative account to a start-up agency in Minneapolis, Barrie D'Rozario Murphy. Two of the three principals of the start-up worked on the United account at Fallon before leaving in November.</p>
        <p>United, part of the UAL Corporation, spent $54.8 million on American advertising last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence, which tracks ad spending, and $78.4 million in 2005. A spokeswoman for Fallon, Rosemary Abendroth, described recent spending as far less than in previous years, when it totaled as much as $100 million, and said the loss would have ''zero impact on the bottom line'' for Fallon, part of the Publicis Groupe.</p>

        <p>The 56,227 fans who watched the Mets play the Phillies yesterday set a record for opening day at Shea Stadium and gave team officials a chance to test their new parking arrangements.</p>
        <p>When workers broke ground in August on the Mets' new ballpark, Citi Field, which is expected to be finished for the 2009 season, one consequence of the construction was the loss of 2,100 parking spaces within yards of the entrance gates to Shea.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, seven parking lots in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, near Arthur Ashe Stadium, were open to accommodate fans, a New York City Parks Department official said. Twelve yellow school buses provided by the team shuttled between the lots and the long wooden walkway between the park and the stadium, running past Long Island Rail Road platforms and the subway.</p>
        <p>''I thought it went very well,'' said Dave Howard, the Mets' executive vice president for business operations, adding that the team could adjust the arrangements during the season and would continue to remind fans that mass transit could take them to Shea quicker and easier than driving and trying to find parking near the stadium.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, many of those at the stadium said they had heeded advice not to try to park at Shea. Len Reiss, 48, a lawyer from Highland Mills, N.Y., in Orange County, combined public transportation with local knowledge. He parked his car in Flushing, a few miles from the stadium, then took the No. 7 train for one stop. Reiss, who grew up in Flushing, said he decided on that plan yesterday morning when he passed the stadium and saw that parking was at a premium.</p>
        <p>''When it's a full house like today, they've got problems,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, plenty of fans drove to the stadium, and some regretted it. Dan Smith, 23, a construction worker from Suffolk County on Long Island, approached Shea at 2:30 p.m., more than an hour after the start.</p>
        <p>''Parking was bad news,'' he said. ''It was terrible, horrendous.''</p>
        <p>Smith said he spent 30 or 40 minutes searching for a spot, before finding one that was a 20-minute walk from the stadium.</p>
        <p>Many people who left about 4 p.m., before the end of the game, followed the long walkway to the area where the shuttle buses stood ready.</p>
        <p>''Plenty of buses, plenty of room,'' said Charlie Armstrong, 36, a landscape surveyor from Oyster Bay on Long Island, who considered the parking plan a success.</p>
        <p>Resting nearby, Marianne Czernin, 59, a security consultant from Lakeville, Conn., agreed with the assessment, but she said she still missed the spots lost to construction.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a death march from the stadium,'' she said, looking back on the path she had just traveled.</p>

        <p>It looks like the driest of technicalities, a provision tucked into the state budget that allows a health insurer to change its structure. But to New York's political powers, this issue -- like so many in Albany -- is really about who lays claim to an extremely large pile of money.</p>
        <p>State government could reap a windfall of billions of dollars from the provision, which was enacted last week. It allows EmblemHealth, the company created by the recent union of two nonprofit insurers, Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York and Group Health Inc., to become a profit-making company that can issue stock. At the outset, that stock would belong to the state.</p>
        <p>For four years, that prospect has had labor unions and New York City officials jockeying in Albany for a piece of the bonanza. Gov. Eliot Spitzer's administration says that the fight is over, and that the state will devote the money from the stock sale to stem cell research and other purposes, but the city and the unions say the struggle will intensify in the months to come.</p>
        <p>The two sides also disagree about how much money they disagree about. The governor's office estimates that the state will get about $1 billion out of the stock sale, but others, including health care finance experts, put the figure at perhaps $3 billion, maybe more. The city and the unions say that Mr. Spitzer is underestimating the state's good fortune, and that there will be more than enough money to make everyone happy.</p>
        <p>And there is another complication: The city has a continuing lawsuit, claiming antitrust violations, that seeks to undo the union of the two companies, which are known as HIP and G.H.I.</p>
        <p>Conversion to a profit-making company will take months, even if all goes smoothly, and it may not be completed until next year, which means there will be plenty of time for groups to lobby the Legislature, asking for passage of a law that gives them some of the money.</p>
        <p>''In our view, this debate is far from over,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers. ''A portion of this money should go to the city and the unions.''</p>
        <p>Hanging over the entire matter is the memory of the only comparable episode in state government. Five years ago, state lawmakers gave Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, later renamed WellChoice, permission to convert from a nonprofit company into a profit-making one.</p>
        <p>In that case, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature devoted most of the expected windfall to powerful interest groups: the health care workers' union and the hospital and nursing home industries. Mr. Spitzer, who took office in January, has cited that deal as a prime example of poor governing, of spending based on political deals rather than on the public good.</p>
        <p>But other labor unions learned a different lesson. They vowed that if such an opportunity arose again, they would try to duplicate the success of the health workers.</p>
        <p>HIP, formed in the 1940s, and G.H.I., which dates to the '30s, have always been nonprofit companies. Last November, they united -- technically, an affiliation, not a merger -- under a new umbrella corporation called EmblemHealth, though they continue to operate under their old names.</p>
        <p>The law provides that the state can allow a nonprofit corporation to convert to profit-making, but that any initial stock issue belongs to the state, in return for the years of exempting the company from taxes.</p>
        <p>HIP and G.H.I. are special cases among health insurers; they were created specifically to serve government employees, who still make up a majority of people enrolled in G.H.I. and a large fraction of those in HIP. As a result, New York City, its workers and their unions have paid most of the companies' revenues over the years.</p>
        <p>More than 90 percent of city employees are enrolled with one of the two companies, and city officials contend that combining them effectively creates a monopoly, which will raise premiums, costing the city hundreds of millions of dollars each year.</p>
        <p>''The city, its employees and their unions have helped build these companies to what they are today, and if they convert, the city deserves a fair share of the proceeds, to protect the city from the inevitable cost increases,'' said Deputy Mayor Edward Skyler.</p>
        <p>Becoming profit-making would allow the company to raise money by selling stock, and could make it easier to borrow money. Such considerations have become more important with widespread consolidation in the health insurance industry, which has left smaller companies at a disadvantage in competing with large ones.</p>
        <p>Together, HIP and G.H.I. cover about four million people, making the new corporation one of the largest insurers in the metropolitan area, but there are national companies with more than 10 times as many customers.</p>
        <p>HIP's management has favored conversion to profit-making status for years, at times lobbying unsuccessfully for the change in Albany. G.H.I.'s leaders long opposed the switch, but their views have changed in recent months, said Ilene Margolin, senior vice president of G.H.I.</p>
        <p>''The marketplace demands it,'' she said. ''Long-term survival requires that we have access to capital.''</p>
        <p>The Spitzer administration viewed the conversion partly as a way to help pay for the governor's ambitious new program of research grants, focusing on the use of stem cells. ''This money is spoken for, for basic scientific research,'' said Dennis P. Whalen, the governor's chief health care advisor.</p>
        <p>The budget also states that 10 percent of EmblemHealth's initial stock issue would go to the New York State Health Foundation, whose mission is to expand access to health care and educate people on health issues. The foundation was formed with some of the Empire stock issue.</p>

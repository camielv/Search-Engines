        <p>Carlos Delgado is known for his power, not his bunting or his speed, which were his most meaningful contributions in the Mets' 11-5 victory against Philadelphia.

        <p>Carlos Delgado is known for his power, not his bunting or his speed, which were his most meaningful contributions in the Mets' 11-5 victory against Philadelphia. Delgado, who went 3 for 3 to raise his average to .267, exploited the Phillies' infield shift in the second inning by bunting Cole Hamels's first pitch to the third-base side of the mound for an easy single.</p>
        <p>''Great footwork,'' Carlos Beltrán said of Delgado's bunt.</p>
        <p>In the fourth, José Valentín hit a bases-loaded single to left, and the third-base coach, Sandy Alomar, waved Delgado home from second. Pat Burrell made a strong throw that pulled catcher Carlos Ruiz slightly toward the Phillies' dugout. As Ruiz reached over to tag him, Delgado slid along the inside of the plate and stuck his right hand in.</p>
        <p>''I saw an opening,'' Delgado said. ''It felt good. It didn't hurt. I'm in one piece.''</p>

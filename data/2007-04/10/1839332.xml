        <p>Officials in the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Interior Department appear to believe that the time has come to reclassify the Florida manatee to ''threatened'' from ''endangered.'' That ''downlisting'' would give the manatee -- the vulnerable, slow-moving sea cow, which is an environmental icon in Florida -- a lower level of protection from its principal enemies, including boats and developers.</p>
        <p>Senior Interior Department officials insist, however, that reclassification is far from a done deal. They say that a routine five-year review of the manatee's status convinced some officials that this mammal was ready for downlisting. While those views were incorporated into an internal memorandum, they say, no formal proposal is on the table.</p>

        <p>Officials in the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Interior Department appear to believe that the time has come to reclassify the Florida manatee to ''threatened'' from ''endangered.'' That ''downlisting'' would give the manatee -- the vulnerable, slow-moving sea cow, which is an environmental icon in Florida -- a lower level of protection from its principal enemies, including boats and developers.</p>
        <p>Senior Interior Department officials insist, however, that reclassification is far from a done deal. They say that a routine five-year review of the manatee's status convinced some officials that this mammal was ready for downlisting. While those views were incorporated into an internal memorandum, they say, no formal proposal is on the table.</p>
        <p>Let's hope things stay that way. By all accounts, laws governing boat speed and waterfront development have led to manatee population increases in the last 30 years. But the creatures remain greatly at risk. Last year, the most dismal since recordkeeping began, 416 manatees died out of a total population of 3,200, many of them in propeller collisions.</p>
        <p>Moreover, manatees now face one new and unexpected risk. In an unfortunate and ironic environmental twist, the laws that have closed coastal power plants have also deprived the manatees of the artificial refuges created by warm-water discharges from these plants.</p>
        <p>This is just one more piece of evidence that the manatee's future, however promising the short-term numbers, remains full of perils that should not be compounded by regulatory rollbacks.</p>

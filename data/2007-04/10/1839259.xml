        <p>The story by the numbers: ''Anne of Green Gables,'' Lucy Maud Montgomery's novel about a Canadian orphan, was published 99 years ago, and it and its sequels have sold some 50 million copies since. It has spawned at least 10 movies and television shows (including an anime version in Japan, where the books have cult status). And the musical ''Anne of Green Gables'' is the longest-running in Canada, going strong since 1965.</p>
        <p>Now a different musical, also called ''Anne of Green Gables,'' has opened at the Lucille Lortel Theater. Though brand new, this version has its own claim to longevity. Its creators, Gretchen Cryer and Nancy Ford, have been writing musicals (like ''I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking It On the Road'') together for five decades.</p>
        <p>While they haven't deserted the grown-up market (another new piece, ''Getting Their Act Together Again,'' will run at 59E59 Theaters from today through April 20), Ms. Cryer and Ms. Ford have learned a lot about the potential benefits of a G rating to shows promoting female power. Recently they have enjoyed multiyear, open-ended, well-received national runs with two incarnations of the ''American Girls Revue,'' which play to young audiences at the popular American Girl Place doll stores in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''Anne of Green Gables'' certainly appears to be going for the American Girl demographic, which was well represented at a recent matinee. It also appears to entertain that group. While the piece may not set the world on fire, it gets its job done in a 90-minute production that, bright and flower-studded, deliberately avoids slickness.</p>
        <p>Those who loved the book need not fear distortion: even when events are telescoped, the highlights of the plot -- about a loquacious redheaded orphan (Piper Goodeve captures Anne's effusive enthusiasm) mistakenly sent to live with the middle-aged siblings Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert (Bethe B. Austin and Erick Devine), who actually wanted a boy -- are responsibly represented. Short, simple songs, delivered naturalistically over simple accompaniments, are woven into the story rather than stopping the action. And the casting is impressive, particularly the three principals and Heather MacRae as the neighborhood gossip Rachel Lynde.</p>
        <p>Although the piece is short, the creators faithfully adhere to the book's entire outline, following Anne until she is a teenager. At this point, the story's agelessness becomes open to question. After Anne and her long-standing adversary, Gilbert Blythe (Dustin Sullivan), sealed their reconciliation with a quick kiss, a young audience member at one performance moaned aloud, seized by an emotion that an observer might describe as disgust -- if not an early foretaste of women's liberation.</p>
        <p>''Anne of Green Gables'' continues through May 5 at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200.</p>

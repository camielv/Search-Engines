        <p>THE twelve-piece jazz band took a break, and Jillian DeGroff asked her husband to order her a glass of water and a clean ashtray while she rummaged through her pencil case and took out a small round watercolor palette.</p>
        <p>Men in dark suits, most of them middle-aged, puffed on cigars. Some tapped their feet as the music started up again, while others leaned in to speak to their companions.</p>
        <p>It was around 9 p.m. last Tuesday inside the Carnegie Club, a cocktail and (legal) smoking lounge on West 56th Street near Avenue of the Americas whose walls are lined with hand-carved bookcases.</p>
        <p>Dim track lighting highlighted the thick smoke as Ms. DeGroff, 50, furiously drew the top half of one of the saxophone players in her red sketchbook. She turned to dip her brush in the ashtray she had filled with water, her Champagne flute tilting dangerously on a pencil that had rolled under it.</p>
        <p>''Don't put your brush in my wine,'' said Dale DeGroff, 58, her husband of 26 years, flashing a smile as he lifted a glass of German riesling.</p>
        <p>This is probably not the first time he has said something like this. The DeGroffs, who live in West Hempstead, on Long Island, spend a lot of time in bars. He is a professional mixologist (his Web site is www.kingcocktail.com) who travels around the world teaching the art of cocktail-making to bartenders.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeGroff usually accompanies him, sitting beside him diligently sketching caricatures of bartenders, musicians, patrons and anyone else who grabs her attention. ''It's all about cocktails and jazz,'' said Ms. DeGroff, who describes herself as personal assistant to the king of cocktails.</p>
        <p>She started sketching people she saw on the subway when she was a teenager, but has been drawing consistently for the past five years, now that her two children are grown. Even after filling many sketchbooks, she strives to use as few lines as possible, believing that's what a good caricaturist does.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeGroff flipped through her sketchbooks in a dark corner of the Carnegie Club and told the stories attached to each as if she were showing pictures from a recent vacation. There was the Gypsy in New Orleans, a difficult neighbor she once had in Brooklyn and a restaurateur in Sydney, Australia. She has given away hundreds of sketches.</p>
        <p>Some sketches can be done in the time it takes for a person to pass her. Some take hours. She draws the more detailed ones from photographs.</p>
        <p>Sketching has long been Ms. DeGroff's hobby, and now her lifestyle meshes with her art. ''We spend hours and hours eating and drinking at the table,'' she said. ''It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it.''</p>

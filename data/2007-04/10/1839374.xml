        <p>Roger Bagnall, a Greek and Latin scholar, has been hired to head a new Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University. The institute, a center for advanced studies and doctoral education, is being founded with a $200 million gift from the Leon Levy Foundation announced last year. Mr. Bagnall, who is to assume his new post on July 1, teaches in the history and classics departments at Columbia University. He is the Jay Professor of Greek and Latin Languages and specializes in the study of ancient papyruses as well as Hellenistic and Roman history. The new institute has stirred controversy among archaeologists because Mr. Levy, a financier who died in 2003, and his wife, Shelby White, collected Greek and Roman antiquities that some experts assert were looted from archaeological sites. N.Y.U. said the new institute was expected to start hiring faculty in the next academic year and begin admitting students for the fall of 2009.</p>

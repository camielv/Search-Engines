        <p>New Life at Caramoor For Monty Python's 'Brian'  Eric Idle (book and lyrics), below, and John Du Prez (music) aren't finished mining Monty Python material. Creators of the Broadway hit ''Spamalot,'' the two have come up with a comic oratorio, ''Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy),'' inspired by Monty Python's ''Life of Brian.'' It will have its United States premiere in two performances on July 1 at the Caramoor International Music Festival in Katonah, N.Y. Mr. Idle will serve as soloist and narrator. His first cousin Peter Oundjian, Caramoor's artistic adviser and principal conductor, will lead the Orchestra of St Luke's with the Collegiate Chorale and featured soloists. Mr. Idle said: ''As the 'Messiah' was to the Bible, so 'Not the Messiah' is to 'Life of Brian.' ''</p>
        <p>Avery Fisher Grant Winners Announced  The Borromeo String Quartet, the violinist Yura Lee and the double bassist DaXun Zhang, above, are to be named the winners today of the annual Avery Fisher Career Grants. The awards, raised this year to $25,000 from $15,000, are intended to recognize and assist instrumentalists and chamber ensembles with potential for major careers. Among the more than 100 recipients of the grants since they were established by Avery Fisher in a major gift to Lincoln Center in 1974 are Joshua Bell, Leila Josefowicz, Gil Shaham and David Shifrin.</p>
        <p>James Naughton to Direct  The Tony Award-winning actor James Naughton (''City of Angels,'' ''Chicago'') will direct the world premiere of David Epstein's ''Surface to Air'' at Symphony Space. The second in Symphony Space's annual Summer Stock on Broadway series, the play, about a people forced to confront repressed emotions when the remains of a family member are recovered 30 years after he was shot down in Vietnam, will run from July 11 through Aug. 5.  The Persona Theater Company of Greece will present its production of ''Clytemnestra's Tears,'' a one-women lamentation written and directed by Avra Sidiropoulou and performed by Themis Bazaka, at La Mama E.T.C. from May 17 through June 3.</p>
        <p>18 Brides for 5 Mothers  Mamma mia! Reality television in Italy has taken a new turn, with the introduction of a show that lets mothers choose their son's wives, Reuters reported. Critics responded immediately by saying that the show, ''Perfect Bride,'' insulted women and demonstrated that Italian television, which already carries reality programming like ''Big Brother'' and ''Celebrity Island,'' had fallen to a new low. In the first episode of ''Perfect Bride,'' carried on RAI, the state broadcaster, the jury of mothers of five single men quizzed 18 bridal candidates about their suitability as wives. Beginning next week the mothers and potential daughters-in-law will live in a ''Big Brother''-style house where the candidates' ability to handle household chores can be scrutinized. Viewers will have a chance to take part in voting off the brides they dislike. The mothers are known by their first names, like Mamma Teresa and Mamma Ambra. Mamma Teresa said she was looking for ''a simple, intelligent classy girl'' for her son Claudio. ''I would like someone who's not too ostentatious and who knows how to take care of the family.'' As for Claudio, she said: ''He has too many girlfriends. I want to find him his ultimate woman.''</p>
        <p>Prize for Elizabeth Spencer  Elizabeth Spencer has been named the winner of the 20th annual PEN/Malamud Award. The accolade recognizes a body of work that demonstrates excellence in short fiction. Ms. Spencer, who teaches writing at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, is the author of seven collections of short fiction, nine novels, a memoir and a play. Reviewing Ms. Spencer's 2001 collection ''The Southern Woman,'' Molly Haskell wrote: ''Her light touch, cool ironies and subtle class distinctions have enough in common with Henry James or British writers like Elizabeth Bowen and Muriel Spark to unsettle readers expecting the danker moss-laden landscape of deep-Southern fiction. Eudora Welty once compared her to Katherine Mansfield, and the great Canadian short story writer Alice Munro is perhaps a sister under the skin.'' The PEN/Malamud Award includes a reading in the PEN/Faulkner reading series at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington and $5,000.</p>

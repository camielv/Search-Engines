        <p>CASLOW--Rubin. The employees of Acme Smoked Fish Corp. deeply mourn the loss of Rubin ''Ruby'' Caslow. Our deepest sympathies go to his widow, Charlotte, and the entire Caslow family. Ruby was a pioneer in the smoked seafood industry and led Acme from a small Brooklyn smoke house to the largest in the country. He always paid attention to both his personnel and the multiplicity of details of business. He was our teacher, his leadership and work ethic were an inspiration to all around him. We will all miss him.</p>
        <p>$(6$)CASLOW--Rubin, died peacefully at his home on April 8, 2007 at the age of 86. He is survived by Charlotte, his devoted wife of 65 years, his loving children Eric and Madeline Caslow and Robert and Miriam Caslow and adoring grandchildren Heather and Jeff Pavell, David and Lisa Caslow, Emily and Nathan Gindi and Adam Caslow. He was the proud greatgrandfather of Julie, Brandon, Alana, Anabelle, Carlie, Lindsay and Lynn. Ruby's second home was his business, Acme Smoked Fish Corp, in Brooklyn, NY where he served as Chairman for 53 years. Funeral services will be held on April 10, 2007 at 1:00pm at Riverside-Nassau North Chapels, 55 North Station Plaza, Great Neck, NY.</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A federal appeals court upheld a ruling that found that federal agencies under the Bush administration had neglected to plan sufficiently for the protection of endangered salmon and steelhead in the Columbia and Snake Rivers. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, affirmed a 2005 decision by Judge James A. Redden of Federal District Court in Portland, Ore., that forced the National Marine Fisheries Service to revise its plan for the fish. Judge Redden said the agency had not met requirements of the Endangered Species Act. The government has been working on the new plan, its third try, and a draft is due later this year. Environmentalists and other groups have long argued that the best way to protect the fish is to remove four hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake River. The Bush administration has said that the dams are a permanent part of the landscape but that other measures, like habitat restoration, can improve fish populations.</p>

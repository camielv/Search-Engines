        <p>A front-page article last Tuesday about Samuel Zell's acquisition of the Tribune Company for $8.2 billion misstated one aspect of an ''S'' Corporation, which Tribune will eventually become under the takeover proposal. Foreigners who are residents of the United States can invest in an ''S'' Corporation; investors are not restricted to United States citizens.</p>
        <p>An article in Business Day last Tuesday about Samuel Zell using an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP, in a transaction for the Tribune Company omitted a condition for an owner to avoid capital gains taxes on the proceeds of a sale of company shares to such a plan. In addition to the ESOP holding the stock for at least three years, the company has to be private for at least one year before the sale.</p>

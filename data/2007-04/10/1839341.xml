        <p>State Senator Wayne R. Bryant pleaded not guilty on Monday to federal fraud and corruption charges and then waived his right to a trial within 70 days, setting the stage for a trial to be held next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bryant, 59, who was named in a 20-count indictment on March 29 after a nearly yearlong investigation by federal prosecutors, entered his plea in United States District Court here before Judge Freda L. Wolfson.</p>
        <p>His co-defendant in the case, Dr. R. Michael Gallagher, former dean of the school of osteopathy at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, also pleaded not guilty in the 20-minute court hearing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bryant, a Democrat from Camden County, is accused of using his influence as chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee to steer millions of dollars in state grants to the school of osteopathy, where a federal monitor said Mr. Bryant had a job in which he was paid to ''lobby himself.''</p>
        <p>In addition, he is accused of doing little or no work at the Rutgers University School of Law in Camden, where he was an adjunct professor. He also served as associate counsel to the Gloucester County Board of Social Services.</p>
        <p>In all, Mr. Bryant was being paid about $175,000 a year for his government jobs, including his $49,000 salary in the State Legislature. The indictment charges that he used the three positions to artificially boost his state pension to $81,000 a year from $28,000.</p>
        <p>In announcing the indictment last month, United States Attorney Christopher J. Christie termed the case the ''most shocking and brazen'' that he had encountered in his nearly five years of investigating public corruption in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gallagher is charged in the indictment with helping Mr. Bryant obtain what investigators said was a ''no-show job'' at the school of osteopathy and with fraudulently obtaining pay bonuses from the school.</p>
        <p>Carl D. Poplar, Mr. Bryant's lawyer, and Jeremy Frey, Dr. Gallagher's lawyer, asked Judge Wolfson to declare this a ''complex case,'' and therefore not one that under federal speedy trial rules must come to trial within 70 days.</p>
        <p>Both lawyers said that more time was needed to review the prosecutors' evidence and frame pretrial motions. The prosecutors, Assistant United States Attorneys William E. Fitzpatrick and Joshua Drew, did not oppose the request.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bryant and Dr. Gallagher remain free on $250,000 bond. The judge said their trial would start on Jan. 28.</p>

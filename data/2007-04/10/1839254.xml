        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- The way things are going this season, it's anyone's guess who will survive tonight's round, in which the eight remaining contestants perform Latin-tinged songs after being coached by Jennifer Lopez. Tomorrow night, Ms. Lopez, left, will get sultry in ''Qué Hiciste'' (''What Have You Done''), the first single from her new Spanish album, ''Como Ama una Mujer'' (''How a Woman Loves''), and one competitor will say ''adios.''</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) HOUSE  -- In there a doctor on the plane? House and Cuddy find themselves -- big surprise -- at odds when, on the return flight from a conference in Singapore, some of their fellow passengers become violently ill. And suddenly, House is holding Cuddy's life in his hands.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13) AFGHANISTAN: THE OTHER WAR -- ''The Taliban and Al Qaeda are preparing to launch new attacks,'' President Bush said in a speech this winter about the security situation in Afghanistan. ''Our strategy is not to be on the defense, but to go on the offense.'' With increasing threats to Afghanistan's government, he pledged $10 billion and thousands of additional allied and Afghan troops to stabilize and rebuild the country. This ''Frontline/World'' documentary ventures inside the campaign by the West to win over the Afghan people and head off a resurgent Taliban.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (A&amp;E) DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER -- ''What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'' That's the motto of the bounty hunter Duane (Dog) Chapman, above, who begins the fourth season of this reality series by fighting extradition to Mexico for his 2003 capture of the fugitive rapist Andrew Luster.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Nick at Nite) THE SEARCH FOR THE FUNNIEST MOM IN AMERICA -- If anyone can make motherhood funny, it's Roseanne Barr, the host of this third season of the competition series in which 13 women pull out their laundry lists of mommy material for a shot at $50,000 and the chance to play host to an evening of special programming. Kim Coles and Hal Sparks are the celebrity judges.</p>
        <p>9:30 P.M. (MTV) SCARRED -- The people at MTV are billing this new series as almost too painful to watch. Its subject: gruesome scars and the stories behind the disfigurements.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (FX) THE SHIELD -- Vic is out for revenge after a warrant is issued for his arrest in Lem's murder.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (ABC) BOSTON LEGAL -- Wishful thinking: Denny tries to use the power of the positive to summon Raquel Welch to his office.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Food Network) RACHAEL RAY'S TASTY TRAVELS -- Ms. Ray, right, proves the tired adage that the city never -- well, you know -- by breaking down New York eating hour by hour: breakfast at Good Enough to Eat, lunch at Max Brenner's chocolate shop, dinner and drinks at Japonais and late-night pirogies at Veselka.</p>

        <p>A federal judge modified the conditions of presentencing release for Richard M. Scrushy, left, the former HealthSouth chief executive whom prosecutors accused of testing the government last month, when he took an unapproved trip by yacht from Palm Beach, Fla., to Miami. In June, a federal jury convicted Mr. Scrushy of bribing former Gov. Don Siegelman. His sentencing date has not yet been set. Under the new conditions, Mr. Scrushy must wear a tracking device when leaving Alabama, must submit a precise itinerary for such trips and must use only commercial air travel.</p>

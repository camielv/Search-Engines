        <p>Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini, right, with Edie Falco, who plays his wife, Carmela) and fellow mobsters returned to HBO on Easter Sunday for the first episode of the Season 7, leaving network television feeling the heat. Opposite ''The Sopranos'' at 9 p.m. ABC's ''Desperate Housewives'' delivered its lowest ratings ever among adults 18 to 49, excluding clip shows and repeats. Ratings for the ''Sopranos'' premiere were not available yesterday, but Nielsen's estimates for the networks show that ''Housewives,'' in its first new episode since March 4, earned a below average (although still dominant) 15.7 million viewers. ABC remained the night's leader in the 18 to 49 set, winning both the 8 p.m. hour with ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' (12 million) and the 10 p.m. hour with ''Brothers &amp; Sisters'' (11 million). CBS ranked second among viewers 18 to 49, but fared slightly better than ABC in total viewers. CBS's ''60 Minutes,'' with its profile of Senator John McCain, led the 7 p.m. hour (12.9 million), and CBS's ''Without a Trace'' was the most watched show at 10 (14.1 million).</p>

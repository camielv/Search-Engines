        <p>STUDENT LOAN XPRESS SUSPENSIONS -- The CIT Group has suspended three officers in its Student Loan Xpress subsidiary after new disclosures involving ties to some university financial aid officials. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF OIL -- An ambitious plan by President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela to take control of several important oil projects from American and European companies is nearing a showdown. But in the end, all sides could wind up losing. [A1.]</p>
        <p>PATIENCE WITH CHINA WANING? -- For years, President Bush has avoided confronting China with sanctions or legal challenges to its trade practices, preferring to use diplomacy to press China to bring down its trade deficit with the United States. That stance may be hardening. [A1.]</p>
        <p>PFIZER DRUG ISN'T SELLING -- Exubera, the only commercially available inhaled insulin treatment for diabetes, is turning into an expensive flop for Pfizer.

        <p>AS CELEBREX AD IS CRITICIZED -- Public Citizen, a consumer group, has asked the Food and Drug Administration to ban a television advertisement for Pfizer's painkiller Celebrex on the ground that it gives consumers a false impression that the prescription drug has no more safety risks than some other painkillers. [C8.]</p>
        <p>MORE HOME LOAN PROBLEMS -- Mortgage difficulties appear to be cropping up in some loans made to borrowers with decent credit, as the lenders American Home Mortgage and M&amp;T Bank Shares, both based in New York, have learned. [C1.]</p>
        <p>SHORING UP AN ARCHIVE -- Corbis, a corporation founded and owned by Bill Gates that holds rights to 100 million photographs, has appointed a new chief executive who is an expert in rights law. He is expected to plot the company's response to the rise of low-cost online photo services that threaten to undermine its lucrative photo sales. [C1.]</p>
        <p>DON IMUS IS SUSPENDED -- NBC News and CBS Radio have both suspended the radio host Don Imus for two weeks over his racially disparaging remarks about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. [C1.]</p>
        <p>NEW BUYOUT RECORD POSSIBLE -- One of Canada's largest pension funds is in talks with other investors to form a consortium to make a $45 billion takeover bid for the parent company of Bell Canada in what would be the biggest buyout in history. [C1.]</p>
        <p>UNHAPPY WITH THE TIMES COMPANY -- A second corporate advisory firm, Glass, Lewis &amp; Company, is urging shareholders of The New York Times Company to withhold their votes for directors at the company's annual meeting later this month. [C7.]</p>

        <p>PAPER'S SALE VIOLATES CONTRACT -- An arbitrator ruled the Tribune Company's sale of The Advocate of Stamford to the Gannett Company violated a union contract by failing to require Gannett to honor the newsroom employees' collective bargaining agreement. [C2.]</p>
        <p>NEW CAMPAIGN FOR SONY -- Sony's new ad agency has produced a series of humorous ads tied into the ''Spider-Man 3'' movie to emphasize features on its camcorders and digital cameras that can solve age-old photography problems like blurriness and shakiness. [C3.]</p>
        <p>MCDONALD'S AGREES TO UNIONS -- A year after Wal-Mart Stores unionized all its stores in China under pressure from the government, McDonald's is cooperating with China to allow more unions in its 750 outlets. [C3.]</p>
        <p>REVAMPING CITIGROUP -- Citigroup chairman and chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, below, will announce plans tomorrow for the bank's first major overhaul since a merger forged Citigroup a decade ago. It is part of broad effort to streamline the bank's global operations and get costs under control. [C9.]</p>
        <p>FIRST N.Y.S.E. CHAIRMAN DIES -- James J. Needham, the first full-time paid chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, died on Friday at his home in Southampton, N.Y. [B6.]</p>

        <p>MORE PIECES, STILL A PUZZLE -- New rules were supposed to paint a fuller picture of executive pay, but more information has not brought more clarity. A special report on executive pay is at nytimes.com/business.</p>

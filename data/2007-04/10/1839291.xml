        <p>MAKING MONEY AGAIN -- After six consecutive years of losses, the global commercial aviation system is expected to post an overall profit of $3.8 billion this year and an estimated $7.6 billion profit next year, the International Air Transport Association says. The total of passengers this year is expected to be 2.2 billion, continuing a steady growth in traffic since 2003.</p>
        <p>NEW REGISTERED TRAVELER ENTRY -- The Registered Traveler program, which proponents had predicted would be operating at full steam by now, continues to plod along. The latest airport to opt in is Huntsville International Airport in Alabama, which asked the FLO Alliance -- a group led by the Saflink Corporation -- to design a plan for operating an expedited-security lane. FLO (which stands for fast lane option) will need to seek certification from the Department of Homeland Security to begin operations, a process that can take over a year. To date, only one company, Verified Identity Pass, actually operates expedited security lanes, at about half a dozen major airports.</p>
        <p>INTRODUCING THE DREAMLINER -- Boeing plans to introduce its first 787 Dreamliner model on July 8 (the date is ''7/8/07,'' Boeing notes). The public will be able to see the aircraft fully assembled for the first time at the event, at Boeing's assembly plant in Everett, Wash. The first commercial delivery of the 787 is expected in May 2008. The midsize plane is sold out through 2013.</p>
        <p>CAMPTON HOTEL SOLD -- The Indian luxury hotel group Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces agreed to pay $58 million for the Campton Place in San Francisco, which would become the third Taj hotel in the United States. The others are the Pierre in New York and the Taj Boston. The San Francisco property is being sold by the Kor Hotel Group, which purchased it 18 months ago for $44 million.</p>
        <p>NEW AIRLINE -- ExpressJet, which formerly operated primarily as a regional jet supplier for mainline carriers, began service under its own name last week, using Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets in 24 markets in the West, Southwest and Midwest. The airline offers 100 channels of free XM radio at each seat and intends to focus on ''growing markets with populations that are the right size for our 50-seat aircraft,'' said Jim Ream, the chief executive.</p>
        <p>ET CETERA -- Virgin Atlantic has begun an in-flight film festival to give exposure to new talent. Over the next four months, the airline will include 14 short independent films among its in-flight video offerings. Passengers can vote to compile a short list of six films, and a film industry panel will then choose a winner  The number of scheduled flights between Europe and the United States was 5 percent higher in January than January 2006, said the European Travel Commission, citing flight schedule data from OAG, the global transportation information company.</p>

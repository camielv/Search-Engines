        <p>Editorial objects to Fish and Wildlife Service's decision to consider reclassifying Florida manatee to 'threatened' from 'endangered'; says such downlisting would give manatee lower level of protection from its principal enemies, including boats and developers</p>

        <p>Re ''Britons Say They Feared for Lives in Iran Captivity'' (front page, April 7):</p>
        <p>It is terrible that the recently seized British sailors and marines were treated poorly in captivity while in Iran, but it should not be a surprise if one considers how the policies of the United States, Britain's major ally, regarding prisoners and ''detainees'' have evolved in the years after 9/11.</p>

        <p>Re ''Britons Say They Feared for Lives in Iran Captivity'' (front page, April 7):</p>
        <p>It is terrible that the recently seized British sailors and marines were treated poorly in captivity while in Iran, but it should not be a surprise if one considers how the policies of the United States, Britain's major ally, regarding prisoners and ''detainees'' have evolved in the years after 9/11.</p>
        <p>If ''our'' side can torture, isolate and incarcerate individuals for indefinite periods of time, it should not be a shock if the ''other'' side in a conflict resorts to the same illegal and inhumane treatments of its prisoners.</p>
        <p>Rather than only be disgusted by the actions of the Iranian captors, we should be demanding that our government cease its own ghastly treatment of people it believes -- often without proof -- to be its enemies.</p>
        <p>Jim Carmin  Portland, Ore., April 7, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Those who chided the returned British sailors and marines for their compliance with their captors should be ashamed. Honor has its place, but not to the exclusion of all common sense.</p>
        <p>We in the Western world abhor the notion that because a woman has been raped, her family must murder her to protect both her and family honor. We reject the notion as barbaric that suicide is a legitimate form of protest. These essential beliefs are precisely what separate us from Islamic extremists.</p>
        <p>Why, therefore, do some suggest that these sailors and marines acted dishonorably in saving their own lives?</p>
        <p>Of what value are 15 dead heroes? The price for saving these sailors and marines was cheap. Is offended pride enough to condemn 15 to death? Life is precious. Well done to the Britons for seizing the opportunity to save themselves.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''No Diplomatic Change After Britons' Release'' (news article, April 6): Richard M. Nixon achieved significant progress because he was not afraid to talk to our Korean War enemy, Communist China, and President Ronald Reagan successfully negotiated with our cold-war adversary, the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain did not fear to talk to the Iranians and resolved this dangerous situation not with threat and rhetorical bombast but with enlightened diplomacy. Unfortunately, these significant lessons of history have not been learned by the Bush-Cheney administration.</p>

        <p>Four people escaped from a burning apartment building in Bronxdale yesterday morning, including two children who jumped 10 feet from a fire escape and were caught by police officers, the police said. The fire, which officials said was caused by a candle in the living room, began shortly after 10 a.m. in the building at 2504 Bronx Park East. Of the four people who escaped, three refused medical treatment. The fourth was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, the department said. Twelve firefighters were treated for injuries, the most serious described as burns to the ear. The officers who caught the children were identified as Paul McLaughlin and Maximo Rosado, both assigned to the Bronx.</p>

        <p>REINSTEIN--Harvey, died at 78. Harvey Reinstein, a well known and widely respected television syndication salesman for such companies as Four Star, Metromedia, MGM and Lorimar, died early on the morning of his 78th Birthday on April 6th at his home in Lake Worth, Florida. His loving daughter, Beth, was at his Bedside, as she had been through his illness. Harvey Richard Reinstein, formerly of Dix Hills, NY, was born on April 6th, 1929, in the Bronx, New York. The son of David Reinstein, a furrier, and Marcella Reinstein, a singer and homemaker. Although he was an imposing 6'5'' tall, Harvey often disarmed people with his warmth and humor. This charm earned him numerous friends and associates that have become his extended family throughout the years. Besides his daughter, who lives in California, Harvey is survived by his son, Adam; daughter-in-law Lisa, and grandchildren Joshua, Danielle and Lillian, all residing in Ohio. He is predeceased by his loving wife of 41 years, Myrna and brother, Joel. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday April 10th, 12 noon at Schwartz Bros./Jeffer Memorial, on Queens Blvd and 76th Road. Donations in Harvey's name can be made to the American Cancer Society. Harvey was large in life, and larger than life. He will always be loved and now missed.</p>

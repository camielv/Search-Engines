        <p>As a soundtrack of whistling wind filled Merce Cunningham's dimly lighted studio, Ms. Soll's trim, white-clad figure flowed through big, slow arcs, only to convulse into violent gestures.

        <p>Beth Soll has been creating dances since 1965, and in her ''Rustling Solo'' on Saturday night she seemed like a being from another time.</p>
        <p>As a soundtrack of whistling wind filled Merce Cunningham's dimly lighted studio, Ms. Soll's trim, white-clad figure flowed through big, slow arcs, only to convulse into violent gestures. She might have been an austere priestess coming to offer an invocation, or perhaps a moon-dweller swooping down for a visit. Whatever the context for this brief dance from 1990, it was far removed from the city glittering just beyond the 11th-floor studio's huge windows.</p>
        <p>This sense of chilled distance lasted throughout the program's other piece, ''Black Flower,'' a new ensemble dance for Erin Ghislin, Lindsey Hedrick, Pearl Marasigan, Mariah Steele and, briefly, Ms. Soll. As the four women cut leaping diagonals across the stage, the work of another modern-dance priestess came to mind: Martha Graham's 1936 antiwar epic, ''Chronicle,'' whose scything lines of fierce women never fail to elicit shivers.</p>
        <p>Occupying Christine Shallenberg's fractured landscape of light and harried by George Crumb's often ominous compositions, Ms. Soll's women were more agitated than fierce. With their hair half up, and dressed demurely in black formalwear, they seemed like lost girls and conveyed little beyond a vague sense of urgency and dread; sure technicians all, they are not yet artists able to make their lashing limbs and inscrutable gestures mean something. It was clear to see that they were upset, but the why, the how and the ''so what?'' remained obscure.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps they simply couldn't make Ms. Soll's movement mean anything. ''Black Flower'' is divided into nine sections, with titles like ''Turning'' and ''Wild,'' but the register of emotion, and movement, is all too static.</p>
        <p>It's fine to create a world unto itself. (It can be one of the great pleasures of theater.) But if that world is not based in this one, the two compete. And, as the studio's glorious views of Manhattan demonstrate, the competition is steep.</p>

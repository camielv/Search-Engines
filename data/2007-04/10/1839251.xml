        <p>The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, originally designed to prevent meningitis and blood infections in infants, also provides immunity against the virus that causes ear infections, and may be even more effective at doing so than researchers first thought.</p>
        <p>A study  of 150,000 children in Tennessee and 27,000 in New York State found that the benefits of the vaccine might extend even to children who are not fully vaccinated.</p>
        <p>Frequent ear infections declined by 17 percent in Tennessee and 28 percent in New York among children born in 2000 and 2001, after the vaccine was put into widespread use, compared with children born in 1998 and 1999. The surgical insertion of draining tubes, a common treatment for chronic ear infections, went down by 16 percent in Tennessee and 23 percent in New York. About 75 percent of the children were vaccinated in the 2000-1 cohort, compared with less than 1 percent in the older group.</p>
        <p>The declines in frequent infections and tube insertions matched or exceeded those of randomized trials of the vaccine. That suggests that children other than those fully vaccinated are also benefiting, because vaccinated children are less likely to pass the disease to others.</p>
        <p>The authors, writing in the April issue of Pediatrics, acknowledged that they did not know the vaccination status of individual children, and that difficulties in estimating vaccine coverage, incomplete reporting by health professionals and differences in diagnoses among doctors could have affected the results.</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 17, 2007, Tuesday  An article in Science Times last Tuesday about the benefits of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine referred incorrectly to one of the causes of ear infections. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a kind of bacteria, not a virus.</p>

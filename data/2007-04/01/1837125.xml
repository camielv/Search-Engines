        <p>In the library of bad jokes, there are plenty of responses to the immortal question ''How many actors does it take to screw in a light bulb?'' (My personal favorite: Five -- one to screw in the bulb and four to say, ''I could have done that better.'')</p>
        <p>The issue of just how many actors it takes to make a successful play has no comparably snappy answer. But New York audiences will have the chance this week to evaluate the relative merits of double- and single-digit ensembles with the opening of productions from creators famous for bringing bracing new perspectives to their genres: the South African playwright ATHOL FUGARD and the French composers ALAIN BOUBLIL and CLAUDE-MICHEL SCHÖNBERG.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boublil and Mr. Schönberg are the fellows who gave the world a strapping new breed of megamusical -- of epic sweep and steamroller score -- in the 1980s with ''Les Misérables'' and ''Miss Saigon.'' Two decades later they are hoping to re-establish themselves as the biggest and splashiest on the block with ''THE PIRATE QUEEN,'' a swaggering tale of love, rivalry and stage-sized boats in the 16th century, written in collaboration with Richard Maltby Jr. Frank Galati (''The Grapes of Wrath'') oversees a cast of 42 -- count 'em, 42. Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100; $51.25 to $111.25.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fugard has always worked on a canvas that seems diminutive by comparison. But his plays, among the first to deal with the moral consequences of apartheid, have consistently shown that big explosions can come in small packages. His greatest works, including ''Boseman and Lena,'' ''The Island'' and ''Blood Knot,'' have kept the dramatis personae to a potently bare minimum. His new two-character drama, ''EXITS AND ENTRANCES,'' inspired by his relationship with the South African actor Andre Huguenet, opens Wednesday. Stephen Sachs directs Morlan Higgins and William Dennis Hurley in the roles of actor and playwright. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com; $60.</p>

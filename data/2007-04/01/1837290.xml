        <p>Dave Carman was driving home to City Island through Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx last Sunday night when he spotted a deer munching on grass beside a guardrail.</p>
        <p>For decades, deer have been rare sights in the city. But with suburban sprawl and the explosion of the deer population upstate, deer have more and more found their way to the five boroughs. A herd appears to have taken up residence in Staten Island, for example, and there have been occasional deer sightings in Inwood Hill Park and Riverside Park in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Now, precisely because of experiences like Mr. Carman's, the next milestone has been reached in the deer's return to New York: the request for deer-crossing signs.</p>
        <p>In Pelham Bay Park, where cars zip through to City Island and Orchard Beach, people have noticed deer for several years, and some worry about the urban driver's mind-set.</p>
        <p>''City people don't expect a deer to dart in front of cars,'' said Mr. Carman, adding that he had seen clusters of a half-dozen deer in the park.</p>
        <p>Last month, Virginia Gallagher, the chairwoman of the local community board, asked the city's Department of Transportation to erect deer-crossing signs. She suggested at least three spots for the signs, including Shore Road between Westchester County and the Bronx, the Bartow Pell Circle and the City Island Avenue traffic circle.</p>
        <p>''Their response, and it's perfectly understandable, was: 'We never had any deer-crossing signs because we never had any deer,' '' Ms. Gallagher said. ''I said, 'Well, this is our historic first.' '' A department spokeswoman, Kay Sarlin, confirmed that the city had no deer-crossing signs and was not planning to install them in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''Because deer crossings are rare and there is no identifiable pattern to where deer cross city streets, warning signs are not an effective way to prevent crashes,'' Ms. Sarlin said.</p>
        <p>The Parks Department is not currently managing the deer in Pelham Bay Park because they are thought to be a transient rather than resident population. But Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, said that if the deer became resident, he would work with the Transportation Department to put up signs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benepe added that like the city's growing populations of wild turkeys and raccoons, the deer are a welcome reminder that ''the woodlands have been there for centuries, and the deer are just moving through their property.''</p>
        <p>''It belongs to them as much as anyone else,'' he said.</p>

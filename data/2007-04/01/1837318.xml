        <p>Re ''Will Diners Still Swallow This?'' (March 25), about the debate over portion sizes at restaurants:</p>
        <p>If chain restaurants really wanted to help consumers, they would stop trying to torpedo New York City's new requirement, effective this July, that certain chains list calories on their menus and menu boards. That disclosure will empower consumers and encourage restaurants to compete on the basis of nutrition.</p>
        <p>Better yet would be a federal law requiring all chain restaurants to list calories on their menu boards and calories, sodium and saturated plus trans fat on printed menus.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>If we're going to get serious about fighting obesity, some parts of the food industry will take a hit. But others -- whether farmers, suppliers, retailers or restaurants that can make healthy food available to more people -- will have a chance to benefit as we make the mental shift toward valuing quality over quantity. The gain is worth the pain.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A simple but sensible solution on restaurant portion sizes: Why not give smaller servings, slightly cheaper, with the option to order seconds for $1 or $2 more?</p>

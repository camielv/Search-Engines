        <p>It's time for another retirement study to make you feel anxious and afraid. These studies always come to one conclusion: No matter how much you are saving for retirement, it isn't enough, and you should save much, much more. So you'd better stop spending money on anything related to your present life.</p>
        <p>A new study, from the Watson Wyatt consulting firm, of 300,000 workers at 32 large employers shows that 70 percent participated in a company retirement plan, mainly a 401(k), and they contributed, on average, 8.4 percent of their pay.</p>

These studies always come to one conclusion: No matter how much you are saving for retirement, it isn't enough, and you should save much, much more.

        <p>A new study, from the Watson Wyatt consulting firm, of 300,000 workers at 32 large employers shows that 70 percent participated in a company retirement plan, mainly a 401(k), and they contributed, on average, 8.4 percent of their pay.</p>
        <p>At least these workers were trying, although they should immediately cease eating out, going to movies and buying things so they can save even more. Others appeared to be in denial about retirement and were not participating in any plan.</p>
        <p>Watson Wyatt noted that it was not surprising that 52 percent of people making $10,000 to $25,000 annually were not signed up with a company retirement plan. But almost one out of 10 employees making more than $100,000 a year were also 401(k) no-shows. It must be that these people have other sources of income or plan to work until they drop dead. Either that, or they'd better start saving.</p>

        <p>Martha Stewart's effort to trademark the name of her new hometown -- Katonah -- for her new furniture line has drawn the ire of some of her neighbors who fear that she wants the name all to herself.</p>
        <p>The Katonah Village Improvement Society has set aside $200 that could be used to fight her plan. It has until April 11 to file an objection with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The society declined to comment on whether it would take action.</p>
        <p>Katonah, with a population of about 7,300, is 40 miles north of Manhattan. Ms. Stewart moved to a 153-acre estate there in March 2005 and filed the trademark application later that year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart's neighbors fear that trademarking the name will prohibit others from using it in their businesses. But Diana Pearson, a spokeswoman for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, said that Ms. Stewart had registered trademarks for other furniture collections inspired by her homes, including Turkey Hill, in Westport, Conn.</p>
        <p>In a Feb. 6 letter to the village, John R. Cuti, a lawyer for Ms. Stewart, said a trademark would not ''stop the public from being able to use ordinary words, including place names, even as business names.'' He said Pepperidge Farm's trademark of Sausalito for cookies ''has not stopped residents of that town from living and working as they always have.''</p>

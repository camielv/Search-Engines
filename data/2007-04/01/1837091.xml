        <p>Stuck in London with some free time between visiting the Victoria and Albert Museum and Harrods? Go to visitlondon.com, click on its newest Web feature, London Explorer and type in either destination. The search engine (which also uses postal codes and tube stops for points of reference) will pull up the closest attractions in the vicinity -- in this case, the Science Museum or the Natural History Museum -- and flag them on a map, giving their exact coordinates, including Web sites.  The Shelbourne, a Marriott Renaissance Hotel in Dublin, reopened last month after closing for two years of renovations. The 182-year-old property now features a lobby outfitted in Italian marble, stained glass and a new painting by Cian McLoughlin of the actors Barry McGovern and Johnny Murphy (left), who are known for their recent work in Samuel Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot.'' Restaurants and bars include the Horseshoe Bar, the Saddle Room Restaurant and the No. 27 Bar &amp; Lounge. Nightly rates start at about 365 euros, or about $496 at the rate of $1.36 to the euro, through June, and drop to 285 euros for July and August. (www.theshelbourne.ie).  Food, wine and golf are the focus of a new program offered to American Express platinum card holders. Called Personal Pursuits, the program offers outings ranging from lunch at the French Laundry in the Napa Valley to a golf tournament in Bermuda. Transportation and lodging are not included unless otherwise specified (www.americanexpress.com/platinum).  The Pink Beach Club in Bermuda is offering a Culinary Weekend Package through April 30. The three-night package, which starts at $2,600 per person (based on double occupancy) includes a fishing trip, breakfast, afternoon tea, dinner, airport transfers and taxes (www.pinkbeach.com).</p>

        <p>Intentionally or not, Wendell Castle took the advice whispered to Benjamin Braddock in ''The Graduate'' and went into plastics. From 1968 to 1973, the designer-craftsman -- who was already famous for his laminated, surreally shaped wood furniture -- made functional sculptures in plastic that look astonishingly fresh nearly 40 years later. When the New York gallery R 20th Century showed a limited reissue of some of these pieces at Design Miami last December, there was a palpable gasp. His bulbous extrusions and lumpy mounds, with names like Fat Albert and Roxanne, conjure everything from slugs-on-the-go to a torso by R. Crumb. There were stingray-shaped lights etched in neon that wobbled on the ground, tables with octopus legs and a group of furniture called the Molar collection.</p>

        <p>Intentionally or not, Wendell Castle took the advice whispered to Benjamin Braddock in ''The Graduate'' and went into plastics. From 1968 to 1973, the designer-craftsman -- who was already famous for his laminated, surreally shaped wood furniture -- made functional sculptures in plastic that look astonishingly fresh nearly 40 years later. When the New York gallery R 20th Century showed a limited reissue of some of these pieces at Design Miami last December, there was a palpable gasp. His bulbous extrusions and lumpy mounds, with names like Fat Albert and Roxanne, conjure everything from slugs-on-the-go to a torso by R. Crumb. There were stingray-shaped lights etched in neon that wobbled on the ground, tables with octopus legs and a group of furniture called the Molar collection.</p>
        <p>George Beylerian, the founder of the resource bank Material Connexion, was in the furniture business back then and attempted to market and distribute Castle's hard-to-classify plastic pieces. In spite of enthusiastic reviews and prices that were, in some cases, well under $200, the furniture didn't sell. ''They were simply too new for most people's taste,'' Beylerian said. With fewer than 400 pieces produced, Castle abandoned plastic around 1973 and went back to sculpturing wood.</p>
        <p>In April 2004, R 20th Century exhibited about 20 of the original plastic pieces, including the Enclosed Reclining Environment for One, a wood, plastic and flokati womb with a view. Once featured in Time magazine, it had to be rescued from a barn.</p>
        <p>''Castle has always been a major figure in the craft world, but he was overlooked in the '80s and '90s in the art and design world,'' said the gallery's co-founder Evan Snyderman. ''Now people are rediscovering how incredibly experimental and theatrical his work really is.'' And commercially viable at last, if R 20th Century is betting right.</p>
        <p>R 20th Century's reissue, the Black Edition, consists of limited runs of four Castle designs, including two tables from the Molar collection, one of which was so ahead of its time that it could be a Pop precursor of Zaha Hadid's much-talked-about Aqua Table of 2005. The hot colors of the '60s have given way to a glossy black that emphasizes the pieces' shapely forms and, not incidentally, provides a gravitas to match their prices, which now range from $4,500 to $49,000.</p>
        <p>''It's starting to make sense again,'' said Castle, who is again working in plastic -- this time coating his shapes in gold leaf. ''My creative urge is to be at risk. Without that, it's just not very interesting.''</p>

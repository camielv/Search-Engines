        <p>If you're confused by the plethora of new decorating books out there, try an old one. Pointed Leaf Press has reissued ''Decorating Is Fun!,'' the 1939 how-to volume by the legendary American designer and lifestyle guru Dorothy Draper. In it, she extols the virtues of black-and-white checkerboard floors, chintz slipcovers and painting your front door a bright, welcoming color, among other tips that ring as true today as they did when she wrote them. And once you've settled into your new home, you can learn how to be the hostess with the mostest in Draper's 1941 sequel, ''Entertaining Is Fun!,'' which was reissued by Rizzoli in 2004.</p>

        <p>Editorial supports efforts by New Jersey Gov Jon Corzine to strengthen safety regulations at chemical plants and Sen Frank Lautenberg and Repr Steven Rothman for adding amendments to spending bills that would bar federal pre-emption of such regulations</p>

        <p>With all their talk about homeland security, the Bush administration and Congress are doing almost nothing to protect Americans against the danger of an attack on the nation's chemical facilities.</p>
        <p>That danger is especially acute in New Jersey, a center of the chemical industry. Anyone driving on a stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike south of Newark can get an idea of the risk just by looking out the window. And those ugly, malodorous plants are only the most visible targets. Many potentially dangerous but less obtrusive chemical plants and food processors using toxic refrigerants are scattered across the state.</p>

        <p>With all their talk about homeland security, the Bush administration and Congress are doing almost nothing to protect Americans against the danger of an attack on the nation's chemical facilities.</p>
        <p>That danger is especially acute in New Jersey, a center of the chemical industry. Anyone driving on a stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike south of Newark can get an idea of the risk just by looking out the window. And those ugly, malodorous plants are only the most visible targets. Many potentially dangerous but less obtrusive chemical plants and food processors using toxic refrigerants are scattered across the state.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, attention has focused on the Kuehne chemical plant, a particularly vulnerable chlorine factory located near the Pulaski Skyway in Kearny. An explosion at the plant or at just one of the freight cars parked on the plant's rail link could release clouds of deadly chlorine gas that would drift as far as the west side of Manhattan and put millions of people at risk.</p>
        <p>New Jersey is trying to address the problem on its own. Last month, Gov. Jon Corzine, who as a Senator worked hard but unsuccessfully for tighter safety regulations for chemical plants, ordered 52 plants using or manufacturing explosive or toxic chemicals to develop plans for using safer materials and manufacturing processes, and to involve their employees in the effort. This would bring to 92 the number of plants in New Jersey that are drawing up blueprints for new safety measures.</p>
        <p>In part because the chemical industry is so important to the state's economic health, and in part because of the industry's influence in Trenton, Mr. Corzine's directive will not require the companies to carry out their plans. However, a company would have to provide a detailed explanation of why it is not following through, which in itself could be an incentive to act. The state has not ruled out making these plans mandatory at some point in the future, and it should do so as soon as it can.</p>
        <p>Even in their present form, however, New Jersey's regulations are much tougher than the federal rules that are about to take effect. That alarms Mr. Corzine and several New Jersey members of Congress, all of whom fear the Bush administration, under pressure from industry, will try to assert federal supremacy in the matter to prevent any state from enforcing chemical safeguards tougher than the federal provisions. Such a ban would, of course, make New Jersey less safe than it is now.</p>
        <p>U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg and Rep. Steven Rothman, New Jersey Democrats, have added amendments to the supplemental spending bill for the Iraq war barring federal pre-emption. But these provisions may not survive the legislative process, in which case the administration may be tempted to force New Jersey to weaken its regulations. This might be good for industry's bottom line but not for people in New Jersey and the metropolitan area.</p>

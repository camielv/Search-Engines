        <p>Just as the little green buds emerge in the spring, so do the AUDUBONS at the NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY, which has the world's largest collection of that artist's work. For the third year now the society is making a rite of displaying a selection of 40 fragile watercolors from the 435 that Audubon used for his masterwork volumes, ''The Birds of America.''</p>
        <p>The newest batch, which went on view Friday, have been taken from protective storage, where they are kept away from light for years at a time. Alongside the watercolors, the society will also display documents and other historical materials. (Previous exhibitions have included stuffed birds and even Audubon's muzzle-loading shotgun, which he used to ensure that many of his elusive subjects stayed quite still while he was painting them.) The museum's Web site, nyhistory.org, offers a helpful list of birds that migrate through the New York area, including the red-tailed hawk, the great egret and even the turkey vulture, circling high over Manhattan in search of a free lunch. Through May 20, 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400.</p>
        <p>The historical society will also dig into its vaults to pull out portraits, landscapes, drawings and prints from its huge collections of work by Asher B. Durand, the Hudson River School master, to complement a major Durand show opening Friday at the Brooklyn Museum. ''The World of Asher B. Durand: The Artist in Antebellum New York,'' April 13 through Sept. 30.</p>
        <p>With landscapes in mind the work of a radically different sort of landscape artist are going on display Saturday in Manhattan, at two locations of the Gagosian Gallery. Works from the mid-1980s by WALTER DE MARIA -- probably best known for ''Lightning Field,'' his solemn grid of steel poles arranged on a remote New Mexico mesquite prairie -- are on display through May 5. ''A Computer Which Will Solve Every Problem in the World/3-12 Polygon,'' a stark, rhythmic floor arrangement of 75 polygonal bars, is at 522 West 21st Street, and ''13, 14, 15 Meter Rows,'' a similar meditation on matter and mathematical progression, is at 555 West 24th Street. The work of Mr. De Maria, who has spoken of the ''strangeness of the meaning of geometry,'' brings to mind natural mysticism in the mold of Pythagoras and numerology. But he cautions against easy interpretation: ''Every good work should have at least 10 meanings.''</p>

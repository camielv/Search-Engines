        <p>The METROPOLITAN OPERA will celebrate its 40th anniversary at Lincoln Center with ANNA NETREBKO and ROLANDO VILLAZÓN, the so-called love couple (at least onstage), who will appear in a gala of fully staged acts from ''La Bohème,'' ''Manon'' and ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' along with the veteran bass Samuel Ramey and the rising baritone Mariusz Kwiecien. And there are still tickets available, from $250 to $1,250. Tuesday at 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org.</p>
        <p>Across the plaza City Opera is preparing a treat: a reprise of its 2003 production of Handel's ''FLAVIO'' by Chas Rader-Shieber. It's a bright, antic production that brings a delightful touch of zaniness to an opera that is by turns madcap and sober. It is also the company debut of Gerald Thompson, a countertenor who has been garnering rave reviews and who will go over to the Met at month's end to make his debut there in ''Giulio Cesare.'' Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Friday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125.</p>
        <p>Hugo Wolf's songs are often found in small dollops on recital programs, but there are not many chances to hear his ''Spanisches Liederbuch'' in its entirety. To conclude the Austrian Cultural Forum's ''WOLFIADE,'' a three-part concert series with the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair, Susanna Phillips (a soprano) and Hermine Haselböck (a mezzo) will join the bill for a free concert at Weill Recital Hall on Thursday. This one should be well worth hearing. Mr. Holzmair has also led six selected singers through a set of master classes focused on Wolf; the results can be heard in a recital on Wednesday at the Austrian Cultural Forum itself. Master class, Wednesday at 8 p.m., Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan; recital, Thursday at 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall. Free, but reservations are required: (212) 319-5300, acfny.org.</p>
        <p>Finally, one of the week's most interesting and wacky recitals takes place on Sunday night at Zankel Hall, where Pierre-Laurent Aimard, the ever more respected pianist, conducts a personal tour of the history of his instrument in a dazzling array of short pieces by 29 composers, from Scarlatti and Bach through Carter and Kurtag. Don't miss it. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 to $48.</p>

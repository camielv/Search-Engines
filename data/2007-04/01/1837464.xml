        <p>His players understood how Al McGuire could retire when he was 48 and had just won a national championship. He preached about how they should stretch themselves and how life was a basketball court and they should go right or left and never stay stuck in the middle.</p>
        <p>McGuire, who was 72 when he died of leukemia in 2001, would suggest to his players that they spend six months bartending and six months driving a cab after graduation. They would be better prepared for life, he said.</p>
        <p>''Once you got to know Al, you could understand how he could walk away and not sign the next contract after the championship,'' Butch Lee, the star guard on the 1977 Marquette team, said in a telephone interview Friday from Puerto Rico. ''He would tell us, when you feel confident in yourself, you can move around. Staying still was a problem, not only in basketball, but in life.</p>
        <p>''At that age, you should be just getting the job you want. He was looking for something else in life.''</p>
        <p>Thirty years ago, McGuire sat on the bench at the Omni in downtown Atlanta, buried his head in his hands and cried after Marquette defeated North Carolina to win the national title. It was his last game as a coach because he had already agreed to take a job as a co-chairman with Medalist, a Wisconsin-based sporting goods manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Ben Howland, the coach of the U.C.L.A. team that is here in the Final Four, is 49, a year older than McGuire was when his team won the title. If the Bruins were to win a national championship Monday, it would be preposterous to think that Howland would consider retirement. His contract would probably be torn up and replaced by a new deal with a considerably higher salary.</p>
        <p>The same goes for Florida Coach Billy Donovan, 41. If the Gators were to win their second consecutive title, Florida would have to increase his $1.8 million salary or risk losing him to Kentucky, which is reportedly planning to pursue him as its new coach.</p>
        <p>''Times have changed economically,'' Jim Calhoun, the longtime coach at Connecticut, said. ''When Al walked away, Medalist could pay him at least equal to or close to what he was getting at Marquette. I can't picture somebody 48 today walking away from a lucrative position.''</p>
        <p>Hank Raymonds, who followed McGuire as the Marquette basketball coach and athletic director, said that McGuire's goal was to be the first coach to make $100,000 a year. Raymonds said he was not sure how much McGuire made when he retired, but he was almost sure he never reached that figure.</p>
        <p>McGuire stayed with Medalist for two years, then resigned to focus on being a college basketball analyst, first for NBC and then for CBS.</p>
        <p>Today, a coach usually remains a coach until he is ready to retire, especially if he is as successful as McGuire, who was hired by Marquette in 1964 and compiled a 295-80 record. He had one losing season, his first at Marquette, and won a National Invitation Tournament title as well as an N.C.A.A. championship.</p>
        <p>''He wanted four careers,'' Al McGuire Jr. said Friday in a telephone interview. ''He was a bartender, a businessman, a coach and a broadcaster, so he got all four. He said he didn't want to spend the rest of his life running around with guys in short pants, and that there had to be something else.</p>
        <p>''He said if he knew he was going to win the N.C.A.A. championship, he would not have left. He would have stayed one more year so he could defend his title.''</p>
        <p>Today, coaches who win a championship usually sign another deal to stay for longer than one year. In fact, Tennessee's Bruce Pearl merely turned a mediocre program around and received a six-year deal.</p>
        <p>Walking away from a pile of money is not all that made McGuire different from today's coaches.</p>
        <p>''He would have been his own agent, his own P.R. man,'' Raymonds said. ''He would have done his own negotiating.''</p>
        <p>Rick Barnes, 52, the coach at Texas, said that McGuire once came to Midnight Madness, the first practice of a season, while Barnes was the coach at Providence. Barnes, like many coaches who met McGuire, asked him why he quit at such a young age.</p>
        <p>''He told me he got to where he wanted to go,'' Barnes said this week at the National Association of Basketball Coaches convention at the Georgia World Congress Center.</p>
        <p>Barnes said that he could not envision fleeing the profession after reaching the pinnacle, and not strictly because of the money.</p>
        <p>''I enjoy coaching and being in the gym too much,'' Barnes said. ''I would quit if I didn't enjoy being around players.''</p>
        <p>Bobby Cremins, the coach at the College of Charleston and a former coach at Georgia Tech, became a close friend of McGuire's because both played for Frank McGuire, no relation to Al, who coached Al at St. John's and Cremins at South Carolina.</p>
        <p>''He was a rare bird, eccentric,'' Cremins said of Al McGuire. ''I think that championship was an unlikely national championship. I asked him once about leaving, and he looked me in the eye and said he would have stayed and capitalized on that national championship.''</p>
        <p>McGuire, however, had agreed to leave for Medalist.</p>
        <p>Lefty Driesell, 75, the former Maryland coach, was riding down an escalator at the coaches convention Friday and smiled when asked how McGuire would fit in as a coach today.</p>
        <p>''He was always smarter than the rest of us,'' Driesell said. ''We weren't making any money back then as coaches, but Al was going out to make money after he won that championship.''</p>
        <p>McGuire did get some nice paydays, first from Medalist, then from the networks, but also as a motivational speaker. It was not just his X's and O's that made him a financial success.</p>
        <p>''When I went to Marquette, I didn't realize Al was the character he was,'' Butch Lee said. ''I got there and he reminded me a little bit of Detective Columbo from the TV series; you just never knew what was going on in that head of his.</p>
        <p>''He was like a poker player; on the outside, he didn't send you the message that you could interpret him. He was a genius at work.''</p>

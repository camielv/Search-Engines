        <p>IS it the government's job to prevent people from engaging in unhealthy behavior? Or is it to give them the best available information so they can decide for themselves what to do? A flurry of bills aimed at banning a range of habits -- from smoking in cars with young children to serving partially hydrogenated foods in restaurants -- have state lawmakers weighing privacy issues against public health concerns.</p>
        <p>If passed, bills introduced recently in the state legislature would ban restaurants from serving food that contains trans fats and require calorie and nutrition information on menus; bar adults from smoking in cars in which young children are passengers; and require insurers to offer discounts to policyholders who lose weight.</p>

        <p>IS it the government's job to prevent people from engaging in unhealthy behavior? Or is it to give them the best available information so they can decide for themselves what to do? A flurry of bills aimed at banning a range of habits -- from smoking in cars with young children to serving partially hydrogenated foods in restaurants -- have state lawmakers weighing privacy issues against public health concerns.</p>
        <p>If passed, bills introduced recently in the state legislature would ban restaurants from serving food that contains trans fats and require calorie and nutrition information on menus; bar adults from smoking in cars in which young children are passengers; and require insurers to offer discounts to policyholders who lose weight.</p>
        <p>State Senator Mary Ann Handley, co-chairwoman of the General Assembly's health committee, said there was no dispute that trans fats, secondhand smoke and obesity are harmful. The question is what approach is most effective in changing behavior.</p>
        <p>''When do you act on public good and when do you become the nanny?'' said Ms. Handley, a Democrat from Manchester who introduced the menu-labeling bill. ''That is a line that is not easy to draw. I'm generally in favor of letting people get the information they need and letting them make the decision.''</p>
        <p>State Representative Henry Genga, a Democrat from East Hartford, said the cigarette-ban bill he introduced was intended to protect children from illnesses like asthma related to secondhand smoke. Adults repeatedly found smoking with young children in the car could be charged with a misdemeanor. Opponents of the bill argue that it violates a person's right to privacy.</p>
        <p>''Let's not give government the key to our door so they can come into our homes to fine us and punish us,'' said Gary Nolan, a spokesman for the Smoker's Club, a smokers' rights group. ''This is a free country, and you have the right to be wrong.''</p>
        <p>State Senator John McKinney, a Republican from Fairfield who co-introduced the trans-fat bill, said it was modeled after New York City's ban, passed in December, the first of its kind in the nation. Mr. McKinney said many of the bills were aimed at preventing future health problems.</p>
        <p>''All these bills should be taken in the context that we as a state and 49 other states are struggling with what to do with skyrocketing health care costs,'' Mr. McKinney said. ''What people instinctively know and what doctors will tell you is prevention is the key to so much.''</p>
        <p>Opponents of the restaurant bills say forcing a switch to cooking oils may be a financial burden, as would mandating that restaurants provide nutritional information for all menu items.</p>
        <p>Simon A. Flynn, chief executive of the Connecticut Restaurant Association, said that while many restaurants were already moving to eliminate trans fats, a deadline would drive up the cost of alternative oils and foods. He said it would cost a restaurant more than $600 to have just one item analyzed and print its nutritional information on menus.</p>
        <p>The Super Duper Weenie in Fairfield, where Mr. McKinney lives, has already eliminated foods with trans fats, but the owners say they fear the cost of alternative oils will increase. On a recent busy weekday, with lunch-time lines edging out the door, John Pellegrino, a co-owner, was whipping juicy hot dogs off the grill while chatting with customers. He said labeling his menu items, which include ''the Californian'' -- a hot dog piled high with meat chili and cheese -- would be a problem, and he might have to pass the higher costs on to customers. And most people, he said, already know which foods they shouldn't eat.</p>
        <p>The other co-owner, Gary Zemola, said, ''If you are looking to count calories, what are you doing here?''</p>

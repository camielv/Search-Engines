        <p>Baccarat's latest designer collaboration represents a sea change for the 243-year-old company. At the trade show Maison et Objet in January, it unveiled a line of lighting and tableware by the Paris-based designer Arik Levy that is both intellectual and, in the case of the single-armed Fantome chandelier (above), frugal. In a quest to make the tony brand more accessible to those without high ceilings and higher budgets, Levy -- who's known for his scientific approach to design -- proposed chopping up the classic chandelier (figuratively, that is) and selling it by the piece. At $1,990, ''FantÃ$(4$)me can be used as a design element, 55 lined up in a room, or as a complete object,'' he explains. ''The one arm brings the rest of the chandelier with it, psychologically. It feels like all the other arms are flying behind it, like ghosts.''</p>

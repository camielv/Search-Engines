        <p>Preliminary results from the March 20 mayoral election in Sleepy Hollow put the Republican incumbent, Philip E. Zegarelli, ahead of his Democratic challenger, Thomas A. Capossela, by 29 votes. A recanvassing of the vote, sought last week by Democrats, confirmed Mr. Zegarelli's victory and widened his winning margin to 80 votes. The final count was 950 to 870.</p>
        <p>''We absolutely feel vindicated,'' Mr. Zegarelli said. ''This was a fair vote and a fair count, and the people have spoken.''</p>

        <p>Preliminary results from the March 20 mayoral election in Sleepy Hollow put the Republican incumbent, Philip E. Zegarelli, ahead of his Democratic challenger, Thomas A. Capossela, by 29 votes. A recanvassing of the vote, sought last week by Democrats, confirmed Mr. Zegarelli's victory and widened his winning margin to 80 votes. The final count was 950 to 870.</p>
        <p>''We absolutely feel vindicated,'' Mr. Zegarelli said. ''This was a fair vote and a fair count, and the people have spoken.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats made their request after it was discovered that 11 voting machines and paperwork used in the election did not adequately indicate which election districts the votes came from, said Patricia June Scova, the town clerk in Mount Pleasant.</p>
        <p>The Westchester County Board of Elections deferred the case to Justice Francis A. Nicolai of State Supreme Court, who met with the candidates and election officials in Mount Pleasant, where the voting machines are stored and which includes the Village of Sleepy Hollow.</p>
        <p>''I asked them to go back and count votes on the machines, count the sign-in sheets to indicate numbers of voters, and compare results with the tally sheets to see if we could make a correlation,'' Justice Nicolai said.</p>
        <p>With the subsequent results indicating a more substantial lead for Mr. Zegarelli, Democrats withdrew their petition questioning them and their request for a new election, but not without some disappointment.</p>
        <p>''I accept the judge's decision, but this was a poorly run election,'' Mr. Capossela said.</p>
        <p>He said that in addition to the discrepancy with machines and paperwork, a reconfiguration of voting districts within Sleepy Hollow might have deterred some voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zegarelli, who has been the mayor of Sleepy Hollow since 1999, described the election dispute as ''largely human error,'' but added that the judge ''interceded in a fair and balanced way.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Scova agreed. ''This was quite a large human error, one that had judges involved and lawyers involved,'' she said. ''When you're dealing with elections, you have to be extremely precise.''</p>

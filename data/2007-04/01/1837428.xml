        <p>A 14,000-square-foot mansion on five acres in Upper Brookville, auctioned off after being seized by the Internal Revenue Service, has sold for $8.3 million. On March 22, 42 bidders competed for the mansion, which has five bedrooms, six fireplaces, an indoor pool and spa, an elevator and two four-car garages.</p>
        <p>''It was a packed house,'' said Tim Minoughan, vice president of the CWS Marketing Group, which conducted the auction. ''The bidding began at $4 million, and was over in 15 minutes. People showed up in Rolls-Royces and Lamborghinis.''</p>

        <p>A 14,000-square-foot mansion on five acres in Upper Brookville, auctioned off after being seized by the Internal Revenue Service, has sold for $8.3 million. On March 22, 42 bidders competed for the mansion, which has five bedrooms, six fireplaces, an indoor pool and spa, an elevator and two four-car garages.</p>
        <p>''It was a packed house,'' said Tim Minoughan, vice president of the CWS Marketing Group, which conducted the auction. ''The bidding began at $4 million, and was over in 15 minutes. People showed up in Rolls-Royces and Lamborghinis.''</p>
        <p>He said it was the highest-valued single home on the East Coast auctioned off by the Treasury Department in 17 years. Bidders had to bring a $250,000 deposit.</p>
        <p>Frederick Rudd and Kim Greenberg were the winning bidders. Mr. Rudd is a Manhattan real estate developer and Ms. Greenberg, of Roslyn, operates a laser vision center in the Bronx. Between them they have four children.</p>
        <p>Unlike others at the auction who may have wanted the estate for an investment, Mr. Rudd and Ms. Greenberg plan to live there with their families, Mr. Minoughan said.</p>
        <p>The three-floor French-style estate, which adjoins the Planting Fields Arboretum, was seized from Michael Pescatore, 42, who was convicted last month of extortion and operating the largest automobile chop shop on the East Coast.</p>
        <p>Special Agent Joseph Foy, a spokesman for the I.R.S. Criminal Investigation Division, said Mr. Pescatore pleaded guilty and agreed to serve an 11-year sentence and to forfeit assets. He has already paid $2.5 million, in addition to forfeiting his mansion at 34 Chestnut Hill Drive. Mr. Pescatore has not yet been sentenced formally, Mr. Foy said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foy said the money from the auction would go to the Treasury Asset Forfeiture Fund and be disbursed among the agencies that participated in the investigation of the stolen-car ring. The agencies were the I.R.S., the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nassau and Suffolk County Police Departments, the Suffolk County district attorney's office, the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles and the State Department of Taxation and Finance.</p>

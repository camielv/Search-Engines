        <p>Saudis Assert Themselves</p>
        <p>The News -- King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia called the American occupation of Iraq illegal and warned that the United States would continue to dictate the region's politics unless Arab governments united.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- His speech to the Arab League seemed to underscore growing differences between Saudi Arabia and the White House and suggested that the Saudis would not be beholden to the policies of the United States. But Saudi and other Arab officials suggested the king was positioning himself to get leverage in the Arab world and serve as a counterbalance to Iran.</p>
        <p>A Bloody Reprisal in Iraq</p>
        <p>The News -- One of the bloodiest episodes of Iraq's sectarian strife unfolded in Tal Afar, where gunmen, some of them apparently police officers, killed scores of Sunnis.</p>
        <p>Behind the News The revenge killings followed two suicide bombings in a Shiite area that killed 83 people and wounded many more. Witnesses said gunmen went house to house in a Sunni area, dragging people out to shoot them. As many as 70 may have been killed; bodies were carted to Mosul for identification, above. Some gunmen were identified by witnesses as police officers. The Iraqi Army intervened.</p>
        <p>Talking Again</p>
        <p>The News -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she had persuaded Israeli and Palestinian leaders to hold talks twice a month.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The agreement followed three days of shuttle diplomacy by Ms. Rice. But the talks will deal only with day-to-day concerns such as movement by Palestinians and arms smuggling and not the big issues that have long bedeviled peace negotiations -- the status of Jerusalem, the borders of an eventual Palestinian state and whether Palestinian refugees would have a right to return to Israel.</p>
        <p>Into the Gulf</p>
        <p>The News -- The United States began a major military exercise in the Persian Gulf, dispatching two aircraft carriers and more than a dozen other ships there.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Bush administration officials said the calculated show of force was part of a broader strategy to contain Iranian power and to send a signal that even with its forces stretched thin by the Iraq war, the United States still has the means to project power in the region. It was the first time that two carriers conducted joint operations in the Persian Gulf since 2003, the year the United States invaded Iraq.</p>
        <p>Stalemate</p>
        <p>The News -- Britain froze all business ties with Iran as the dispute between the two countries escalated over Iran's seizure of 15 British sailors and marines in the Persian Gulf on March 23.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Iran claims the Britons had penetrated half a kilometer into its waters. Britain released navigational coordinates showing its sailors were nearly 2 miles inside Iraqi waters. Prime Minister Tony Blair warned the dispute would enter a ''different phase'' if the crew was not released; Iran called on Britain to admit fault.</p>

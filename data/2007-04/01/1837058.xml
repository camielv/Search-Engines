        <p>Cozying up with two mice and a dog hardly sounds like anyone's idea of fun, unless you happen to be the designers Fernando and Humberto Campana. The Brazilian brothers, who have had a soft spot for Mickey, Minnie and Pluto since childhood, recently teamed up with Disney (along with the Albion gallery in London and the Phillips de Pury auction house) to create three different limited-edition Cartoon Chairs, cousins of the designers' playful plush-toy Banquete Chair. And the Albion, which is showing the Cartoon Chairs, will have an exhibition in June of the Campanas' new Trans-Plastic series, an optical extravaganza that promises to make Mickey et al. look like, well, kids' stuff.</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>If Emilia's Deli in Newark's Ironbound were a lesser luncheonette, its attributes could easily be mistaken for liabilities. Chief among them are its hole-in-the-wall atmosphere, short menu of standard Italian dishes and limited schedule (it is closed on weekends).</p>
        <p>The philosophy here is: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Emilia's has been around for almost a quarter-century; since 1999, when the original owner, Emilia Spalliero, retired, it has been owned by two brothers, Dominick and Agostino Fiasche, and their mother, Carmella. Every morning, the brothers head to the kitchen to make timeless meals like spaghetti and meatballs, escarole and beans and chicken Murphy. Their mother often cooks with them.</p>

        <p>The philosophy here is: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Emilia's has been around for almost a quarter-century; since 1999, when the original owner, Emilia Spalliero, retired, it has been owned by two brothers, Dominick and Agostino Fiasche, and their mother, Carmella. Every morning, the brothers head to the kitchen to make timeless meals like spaghetti and meatballs, escarole and beans and chicken Murphy. Their mother often cooks with them.</p>
        <p>There are usually a half-dozen or so choices on the menu, which changes daily but has certain consistent features; for example, you can expect fish fillets on Fridays. The menu can include eggplant Parmesan, chicken Parmesan and broccoli rabe as well as baked ziti, sausage and peppers, Italian hot dogs and fresh mozzarella and prosciutto sandwiches. Most entrees, which are generously portioned, cost $6.</p>
        <p>Lunch is the only meal served; the food is usually ready by 10:30 or 11 a.m., and you'd better get there early; certainly go before 2 p.m., which is when Emilia's typically closes (though the hour is flexible and depends on when the food runs out). Emilia's clientele, which is made up of people from the neighborhood and workers from City Hall, knows what is served when. And sooner or later you'll get to know everyone, especially since you are likely to share a table with fellow diners. The six tables at Emilia's are communal. Checkered tablecloths and posters of ''The Sopranos'' that hang on the wood-paneled walls add to the ambience.</p>
        <p>Emilia's Deli, 234 Jefferson Street, Newark; (973) 344-9370.</p>

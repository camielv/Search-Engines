        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>In the early 1960s, I rooted against Roger Maris because I thought this would help my boyhood hero, Mickey Mantle. When Mantle was hurt down the stretch in '61 while chasing Babe Ruth's home run record, I prayed for Maris to get hurt. I'm sad now that I didn't revel in the greatness and synergy of the two men slugging their way through a remarkable Yankee season. I'm sad that I didn't root for the fine gentleman and great Yankee that Maris was.</p>

        <p>Now I'm a Derek Jeter fan. I found myself slipping onto the anti-A-Rod bandwagon, then I remembered Maris. Alex Rodriguez is a fine gentleman and a great Yankee. Let's let him breathe so we can revel in his brilliance.</p>

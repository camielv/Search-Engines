        <p>The construction site on the corner of Roebling and North 11th Streets in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, known formally as McCarren Park Mews, was a busy place last week, with concrete mixers pulling in and out, and workers pouring the building's foundation.</p>
        <p>But for some neighborhood residents, the most interesting thing about the lot remains the dirt underneath that foundation. In recent months, several photographs have emerged of an oily black substance that seemed to be oozing from the ground, leading bloggers to nickname the site the ''Roebling Oil Field.''</p>

        <p>The construction site on the corner of Roebling and North 11th Streets in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, known formally as McCarren Park Mews, was a busy place last week, with concrete mixers pulling in and out, and workers pouring the building's foundation.</p>
        <p>But for some neighborhood residents, the most interesting thing about the lot remains the dirt underneath that foundation. In recent months, several photographs have emerged of an oily black substance that seemed to be oozing from the ground, leading bloggers to nickname the site the ''Roebling Oil Field.''</p>
        <p>''Anytime you walked within a half-block of it, you just picked up this horrible smell,'' said Philip DePaolo, an audio and video design consultant, ''and it reminded me of the same smell you smell at Newtown Creek.''</p>
        <p>The comparison is significant because the nearby creek was polluted in 1950 by a huge underground oil spill that has still not been cleaned up.</p>
        <p>At the McCarren site, some obvious questions emerged: What is the black stuff, where did it come from, and is there more of it around the area, which is largely a former industrial zone?</p>
        <p>Chris Almskog, a geologist working for an environmental consultant hired by the developer, McCarren Park Mews L.L.C., said there are two culprits. First, workers on the site unearthed an empty heating oil tank with some contaminated soil around it. Second, he said, what appears to be ''some kind of petroleum product'' was leaking into the site from the north or northeast.</p>
        <p>Mr. Almskog said the contaminated dirt has been removed, and waterproof membranes and vapor barriers installed, with city and state agencies supervising. An investigation into the source of the outside pollutant will begin this week, he said, adding that it does not appear to have come all the way from the creek.</p>
        <p>Mr. DePaolo, who said he has noticed a similar odor around other construction sites, said that with so much building going on in the area, city agencies must take notice.</p>
        <p>''God knows what's in the soil here,'' he said.</p>

        <p>It appears that Daniel Sadek, a real estate investor turned movie producer, got a rude surprise in the wake of filming ''Redline,'' about a daredevil driver caught up in a mob-run racing organization.</p>
        <p>In the $26 million movie from Chicago Pictures, one of Mr. Sadek's own luxury cars, a $200,000 Porsche Carrera GT, was totaled. He agreed to that car's being destroyed in the name of art. But then one of the film's stars, Eddie Griffin, smashed another of Mr. Sadek's cars -- a rare Ferrari Enzo, said to be worth $1.5 million -- while practicing last week at a track for a charity race to promote the movie.</p>

        <p>It appears that Daniel Sadek, a real estate investor turned movie producer, got a rude surprise in the wake of filming ''Redline,'' about a daredevil driver caught up in a mob-run racing organization.</p>
        <p>In the $26 million movie from Chicago Pictures, one of Mr. Sadek's own luxury cars, a $200,000 Porsche Carrera GT, was totaled. He agreed to that car's being destroyed in the name of art. But then one of the film's stars, Eddie Griffin, smashed another of Mr. Sadek's cars -- a rare Ferrari Enzo, said to be worth $1.5 million -- while practicing last week at a track for a charity race to promote the movie.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sadek did not reply to calls seeking comment on the crash. But tmz.com, a celebrity Web site, suggested that the crash might be a ''brilliant marketing ploy'' because a video of it showed no reaction by an onlooker.</p>
        <p>In any case, Mr. Sadek, of West Hollywood, Calif., can still console himself with his two other Ferraris, his Lamborghini Murci√©lago, his two Mercedes and his Rolls Royce Phantom.</p>

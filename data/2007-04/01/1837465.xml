        <p>Major League Baseball continued to negotiate yesterday with cable operators and the Dish Network in an effort to persuade them to carry the Extra Innings package of out-of-market games and the fledgling MLB Channel.</p>
        <p>M.L.B. made a seven-year, $700 million deal with DirecTV last month and gave InDemand, a cable consortium that is composed of Comcast, Time Warner and Cox, as well as Dish, DirecTV's satellite rival, until last night to match DirecTV's contract.</p>
        <p>Tim Brosnan, M.L.B.'s executive vice president for business, said that the deadline would expire at the end of today.</p>
        <p>''We continue to talk,'' he said, ''and we wouldn't have extended the deadline if we didn't think we could bring everybody in.''</p>
        <p>If a deal cannot be reached, DirecTV will carry Extra Innings exclusively. DirecTV has agreed to make the MLB Channel available to 15 million subscribers in 2009; the league and InDemand have differed over the terms of making the network available to its digital cable subscribers.</p>
        <p>InDemand and Dish would like a stake in the channel; for being the first to agree to carry it, DirecTV owns 20 percent.</p>

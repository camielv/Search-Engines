        <p>New York State Assemblyman Rory Lancman is leading campaign to prevent Cornerstone of Medical Arts Center Hospital, facility for drug-abuse and alcoholism patients, from opening at former St Joseph's Hospital in Hillcrest, Queens; has introduced bill to grant community boards say in placement of such facilities; photo (M)</p>

        <p>When St. Joseph's Hospital of Hillcrest, Queens, prepared to close in 2004 after 42 years of existence, the neighborhood and the employees rallied hard to save it. But St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers nevertheless sold the hospital building for $10 million, citing poor financial performance, and the 4,000 petition signatures and the rallies could not keep the brick tower open.</p>
        <p>Now, after three years of lying empty, St. Joseph's is likely to be occupied again soon. The development company that bought St. Joseph's will lease it to the Cornerstone of Medical Arts Center Hospital, currently on West 57th Street; Cornerstone hopes to move its 152-bed rehabilitation and detoxification services to the site by October. In the last hurdle for approval, the state's Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services is reviewing Cornerstone's application.</p>

        <p>When St. Joseph's Hospital of Hillcrest, Queens, prepared to close in 2004 after 42 years of existence, the neighborhood and the employees rallied hard to save it. But St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers nevertheless sold the hospital building for $10 million, citing poor financial performance, and the 4,000 petition signatures and the rallies could not keep the brick tower open.</p>
        <p>Now, after three years of lying empty, St. Joseph's is likely to be occupied again soon. The development company that bought St. Joseph's will lease it to the Cornerstone of Medical Arts Center Hospital, currently on West 57th Street; Cornerstone hopes to move its 152-bed rehabilitation and detoxification services to the site by October. In the last hurdle for approval, the state's Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services is reviewing Cornerstone's application.</p>
        <p>But nearby residents and public officials vow to fight to keep Cornerstone out. They say the new services are different from the general care of the old hospital, where cracked white signs still promote St. Joseph's eye care and ambulatory services.</p>
        <p>''It's not really a facility that's going to add anything to the community, in terms of services or growth or development,'' said State Assemblyman Rory Lancman, a Democrat who is leading the campaign and has introduced a bill to grant community boards a say in the placement of such facilities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lancman said that residents are particularly worried about drug-abuse and alcoholism patients being within a few blocks of churches, several public schools and the Yeshiva Ketanah. They also insist that a center around the corner from the hospital building, Aurora Concept, already offers similar services.</p>
        <p>''It's not something you want to cater to in a beautiful neighborhood,'' said Alvin Warshaviak, chairman of Community Board 8, which serves Hillcrest. ''You don't want to put people like this in a neighborhood where you have a lot of young kids.''</p>
        <p>Yet Cornerstone officials said neighbors might not even notice the new treatment center is in operation. Cornerstone's president, Thomas Puzo, said no outpatient treatment would be offered, and patients' stays would be brief, with no visiting allowed, and patients transported only in Cornerstone vehicles. Communication between Cornerstone officials and local civic groups and the community board, he said, has been considerable.</p>
        <p>''We have tried to be as cooperative as possible in instituting a lot of the things they would like to see us do,'' Mr. Puzo said, including moving the main entrance to Union Turnpike from 79th Avenue, installing a tall, tarp-covered, chain-link fence for privacy and agreeing not to erect neon signs.</p>
        <p>He also said Cornerstone might establish a community advisory board. ''We want to keep the lines of communication open,'' Mr. Puzo added. ''We expect to be good neighbors.''</p>

        <p>GREATER SAINTS: Mother Angelica, the jowly Franciscan nun who became an unlikely cable broadcasting star -- Time magazine once compared her to Benny Hill in a wimple -- has the No. 8 book on the hardcover advice extended list. It's ''Mother Angelica's Little Book of Life Lessons and Everyday Spirituality,'' edited by Raymond Arroyo. Mother Angelica no longer tapes episodes of the rambling, slightly batty, ferociously conservative talk show that made her famous; she's had a series of strokes in recent years. But the unbuttoned personality that made her show weirdly addictive is on display in this grab-bag anthology of her wit and wisdom. Take, for example, this big woman's disquisition on her favorite jumbo-size saints. There was St. Francis Borgia, she writes, ''so fat they had to cut a hole in the table so he could reach his food.'' And St. Thomas Aquinas, who ''would get nervous and all he did was eat, eat, eat.'' And finally, she notes: ''Don't believe those skinny statues of St. Anthony you've seen. He was no slim Jim either. He was fat, real fat.'' Mother Angelica puts pudginess where it belongs: next to godliness.</p>
        <p>DOGGED: On the second page of his new memoir, ''Dog Years,'' Mark Doty writes: ''Listening to stories about other people's pets is perilous, like listening to the recitation of dreams.'' So far so good. What follows, alas, are 214 pages of Doty's pet stories. They are, thankfully, a little better than most. Doty is best known as a poet -- his collection ''My Alexandria'' won a National Book Critics Circle award in 1993 -- and as the author of two previous memoirs, one of them, ''Heaven's Coast,'' about the death of his partner from AIDS. ''Dog Years'' picks up where ''Heaven's Coast'' left off; it is in part about the dog he brought home to keep his partner company during his illness. (The book is No. 18 on the hardcover nonfiction extended list.) Doty can be awfully earnest: ''Love, I think, is a gateway to the world'' is a pretty typical line here. He's most interesting in ''Dog Years'' on other topics, including his use of mood-enhancing drugs and their relationship to art. At a conference, Doty reports, someone stood up and said: ''Well, if Van Gogh had medication, we wouldn't have all those masterpieces, would we?'' Doty's reponse: ''I think we'd have a lot more of them.''</p>
        <p>STRAY CARTS: The shortlist for the annual Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Book Title of the Year has been announced. This year's finalists include: ''How Green Were the Nazis?'' edited by Franz-Josef Bruggemeier, Mark Cioc and Thomas Zeller (Ohio University Press); ''D. Di Mascio's Delicious Ice Cream: D. Di Mascio of Coventry: An Ice Cream Company of Repute, With an Interesting and Varied Fleet of Ice Cream Vans,'' by Roger De Boer, Harvey Francis Pitcher and Alan Wilkinson (Past Masters); ''The Stray Shopping Carts of Eastern North America: A Guide to Field Identification,'' by Julian Montague (Abrams); and ''Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming Into Existence,'' by David Benatar (Oxford University Press). It is possible to vote in this competition: www.thebookseller.com. Results on April 13.</p>

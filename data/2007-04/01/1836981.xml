        <p>KIRKNER--Curtis Bane, 76, died March 28, 2007. Curtis was born on Friday the 13th, 1930, an omen he laughingly felt was significant. He grew up in Salisbury, NC and graduated from Catawba College in 1953. He was an English major who immersed himself in the written word and particularly loved poetry. He touched many lives with his kindness and empathy. His life became a battle with mother nature 30 years ago and he fought valiantly and with great inner strength for many years accepting pain and limitation for the gift of life. He never tired of life and found quality in an evershrinking existence. He is survived by a wife who thanks him for taking her on an incredible journey and many family and friends who have marveled at his fortitude. The world is not better off without him but he is better off without the burden of his body. His memorial service will be in your heart and if you wish to remember your favorite charity in his honor. Lee Funeral Home &amp; Crematory of Little River/North Myrtle Beach is serving the family.</p>

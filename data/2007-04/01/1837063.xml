        <p>A new line of furniture at Cibone, the massive lifestyle store that sets the bar for cutting-edge design among Tokyo tastemakers, is meant to answer the question ''What do people really want?'' The answer, of course, isn't simple -- spare architectural couches by the retail design darlings Wonderwall, rough-hewn wooden tables by the Dutch craftsman Piet Hein Eek (above) and bizarre cabinets with fake-fur cabriole legs by the jewelry design duo e.m. Cibone has attempted to unite the diverse collection of 20 objects from eight international designers under the playfully vague heading of ''Non-design Design,'' but outsiders will be struck more by the subtle details that make many of the pieces uniquely Japanese: Eek used local woodworking techniques and scaled down his furnishings to fit the proportions of a Tokyo home, while the Israeli designer Ron Gilad's mummified lamps recall traditional rice-paper shades, but in prototypically Western silhouettes that look plucked from the set of ''The Golden Girls.''

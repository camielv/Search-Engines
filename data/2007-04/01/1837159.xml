      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An Easter egg hunt in East Norwich may well lead to La Bonne Boulangerie. At this handsome eight-year-old bakery you'll find Easter sweet bread in three shapes and sizes, priced by the number of whole eggs in their shells that have been nestled and baked in the flaky brioche dough. A roll with one egg perched in the middle is $2.75; a 10-inch bread ''crown'' holding three eggs is $8.25, and the five-egg, 12-inch cross-shaped centerpiece is $13.75. The season also brings traditional hot-cross buns, filled with dried fruit and marked with a white-icing cross on top ($1.75 each).</p>
        <p>Holiday sweets are a specialty of the owners, the Messina family, who own the adjacent Messina Market and two other Long Island bakeries: La Bonne Boulangerie in Port Jefferson and the Levittown bakery Dortoni, which Raffaele Messina started in 1976. ''Keeping tradition alive, that's really what we do,'' said Daniele Messina, his son. ''This is what Grandma used to make for the holidays.''</p>

        <p>Holiday sweets are a specialty of the owners, the Messina family, who own the adjacent Messina Market and two other Long Island bakeries: La Bonne Boulangerie in Port Jefferson and the Levittown bakery Dortoni, which Raffaele Messina started in 1976. ''Keeping tradition alive, that's really what we do,'' said Daniele Messina, his son. ''This is what Grandma used to make for the holidays.''</p>
        <p>The bakery, which Mr. Messina describes as international, covers Italian territory with an old-fashioned Easter pie filled with wheat grain and ricotta ($18.50). Jewish tradition is represented with Passover-style mandelbrot, a cookielike bread in chocolate marble or nut varieties ($9.50 a loaf) and coconut macaroons ($13 a pound). Although not kosher, the Passover items are made using cornstarch and matzoh meal, not flour.</p>
        <p>The bakery specializes in elaborately decorated cakes for weddings and other special occasions; other year-round temptations include tortes and housemade breads ranging from buttery croissants ($1.90 each) to a hearty Swiss muesli loaf ($8). The bakery has only two stools and a small counter at which to sit. It's better to take the sweets home for the holidays.</p>

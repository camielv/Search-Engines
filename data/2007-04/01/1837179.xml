        <p>I'M still trying to figure Aleia's out.</p>
        <p>It seems to be a neighborhood place. The service certainly is -- friendly, a little rough at the edges but hospitable, even endearing. The room, however, is a little more formal than that and mildly off-putting. While it is decorated in a pretty, feminine style, it somehow comes off as generic.</p>

        <p>I'M still trying to figure Aleia's out.</p>
        <p>It seems to be a neighborhood place. The service certainly is -- friendly, a little rough at the edges but hospitable, even endearing. The room, however, is a little more formal than that and mildly off-putting. While it is decorated in a pretty, feminine style, it somehow comes off as generic.</p>
        <p>Kimberly Snow, the executive chef and co-owner (with her husband, Jim, and Linda Allain) has created a sprawling global menu. It lopes from tapas-style appetizer plates to pizzas (called ''stone pies'') to a diverse assortment of entrees that include a traditional Italian-American veal Parmesan with lots of red sauce, a more contemporary saffron fettuccine with lobster, shellfish and truffle oil and an American sausage-stuffed pork tenderloin with sweet potato mash.</p>
        <p>The quality of the food is variable. My best meal here was on a Friday night, when the dining room was busy and Mr. Snow was making the rounds, enthusiastically talking wine with his customers. The bar was full too, and live jazz was playing. The specialty martinis, served in individual, ice-cold martini shakers, were distinctly better than I usually find on the shoreline. The service was at its most professional. It was fun to be there.</p>
        <p>Salads were given a well-balanced balsamic dressing. Lobster potpie tasted strong to me, but one of my party liked it fine. And a broccoli rabe appetizer, accompanied by lots of homemade fennel sausage, was well cooked in its garlicky sauce. The crust on the Brazilian pizza was crunchy and yeasty, and crisp all the way through, and its intense, acid-sweet tomato topping played off the salty ham and cheese.</p>
        <p>For entrees, the strip steak was a fine, aged cut with a sweet sauce, and the mashed potatoes appropriately buttery. A well-executed béarnaise (surprising on a 21st-century menu) complemented the grilled salmon beautifully. Cornish game hen was nicely cooked, and though the accompanying butternut squash risotto was not a true risotto (it was dry rather than saucy, and sticky with cheese), my dining companion put it away happily.</p>
        <p>For dessert, a classic raspberry charlotte russe reminded us why we still eat such things (the génoise could be sliced thinner) and a mocha cake was thickly spread with a good-tasting chocolate ganache. Cookies that appeared gratis at the end of the meal were adorable, especially the crisp, cinnamon-speckled snickerdoodles.</p>
        <p>Good food was harder to find midweek, however, when the restaurant was sparsely populated and Mr. Snow was not in the dining room.</p>
        <p>An appetizer, skewered chunks of sesame-crusted tuna, was tasteless; it needed more seasoning to compete with the sweet orange-mirin dipping sauce. The chicken quesadilla was crisp and cheesy but needed some kick. Thai shrimp was overcooked. Veal Parmesan was marred by a bitter pomodoro sauce; the truffle oil on a plate of fettuccine with lobster, scallops, shrimp (all overcooked) tasted bitter and extraneous; and the stuffing in the pork tenderloin was commercial tasting (where were the apples and goat cheese?) and the sauce was sweet and sticky.</p>
        <p>Shrimp scampi, however, was sensational, with very fresh, perfectly cooked sweet rock shrimp, tiger shrimp and a garlicky vermouth sauce. Three-cheese pizza (mozzarella, fontina and cheddar), with a robust, garlicky tomato sauce under a thick blanket of cheese, didn't exactly taste Italian but it worked well, and was better than the bland clam casino pizza. We sent Korean baby-back ribs back to the broiler to caramelize the light, sweet glaze, and then they were delicious.</p>
        <p>The bread pudding was served in a large warm hunk, but with too many squiggles of chocolate and caramel.</p>
        <p>The kitchen often seems to overshoot its capabilities, perhaps because it is inconsistently staffed or because the menu is too demanding. In any event, it's clear that Aleia's does some things well. It's just hard to know whether one can rely on them.</p>

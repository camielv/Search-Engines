        <p>An article last Sunday about the ways in which presidential candidates deal publicly with illness referred incorrectly to the death of former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who had lymphoma cancer. He died on Jan. 18, 1997, two days short of what would have been the end of his first term had he been elected president in 1992 -- not one day short. (The error first appeared on Oct. 3, 2004, in an article about the health of Senator John Kerry.)</p>

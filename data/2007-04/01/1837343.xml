        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The D.C. Tea Party,'' by Bob Herbert (column, March 29):</p>
        <p>That yet another example of the hypocrisy of the Bush administration should be brought to light is hardly surprising. In fact, it seems as expected as the rising of the sun each day.</p>
        <p>What could possibly be the rationale behind denying taxpaying Americans representation in Congress?</p>
        <p>Bob Herbert says pressure from the gun lobby helped torpedo recent legislation to give District of Columbia residents just one seat in the House of Representatives, saving President Bush from having to live up to his threat of a veto.</p>
        <p>The gun lobby and any other special interests notwithstanding, the bottom line is that President Bush and the Republicans know that it is almost certain that any representative elected by the citizens of the District of Columbia would be a Democrat and that the balance of power in Congress would be tilted even further against the Republicans.</p>
        <p>The rationale seems to be simply that a majority of those taxpaying Americans happen to be Democrats.</p>
        <p>Gregory Wakabayashi  New York, March 29, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bob Herbert's welcome plea to create Congressional representation for the District of Columbia's nearly 600,000 citizens doesn't note one key explanation for the administration's opposition: the District is 65 percent black; its new House member would undoubtedly be black (and a Democrat); and if the new House bill is a steppingstone to true and full Congressional representation -- two senators as well -- those folks would share the same demographic and political characteristics.</p>
        <p>In New Orleans, we've already seen the disrespect and neglect the administration shows to black-majority cities. Why would we expect things to be different for Washington?</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>10 P.M. (Showtime) THE TUDORS -- Henry VIII's contributions to history include the Church of England, sanctioned divorce and multiple beheadings. A new series further sexes up the story of this English king by taking a look at the young Henry (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, left) as he begins to form the legacy for which he would be known. In the first episode Henry prepares for war with France, and a lady-in-waiting becomes pregnant.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (Animal Planet) CHEETAHS: FAST AND FURIOUS -- ''Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom'' begins its fifth season by following two cheetah tribes. As these families of graceful cats traverse the savanna, providing for themselves grows harder each time a hunt comes up empty.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (Pay per view) WRESTLEMANIA 23 -- It's the battle of the billionaires in the featured match when the Extreme Championship Wrestling world champion Bobby Lashley, representing Donald Trump, fights the Intercontinental champion Umaga (the Samoan Bulldozer), representing Vince McMahon (above right, with Mr. Trump). The mogul whose fighter wins gets to shave his rival's head.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (Gameshow Network) CAT-MINSTER: CFA INTERNATIONAL CAT CHAMPIONSHIP -- The dogs have their day at Westminster; now finicky felines prove their worth at the CFA International Cat Show. The first half of the two-hour special gives a glimpse of behind-the-scenes preparations and the training it takes for kittens to become prize cats. In the second half 55 breeds compete for the title of best in show.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (TLC) SHALOM IN THE HOME -- Rabbi Shmuley Boteach tackles the difficult task of bringing a stepfather and his stepson closer together.</p>
        <p>8:30 P.M. (FOX) KING OF THE HILL -- Bad: Cotton decides to loan Hank's prized Cadillac to his cousin. Worse: Cotton's cousin is Dusty Hill of the rock band ZZ Top, and the car is ferrying around the band and a camera crew as they film a reality television show. Hank's breaking point: As part of the show, the band plays a series of practical jokes and films them.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (A&amp;E) GENE SIMMONS FAMILY JEWELS -- After Shannon's pregnancy scare, Gene suggests that they consider adoption. Shannon takes that idea and runs with it faster than Gene could have imagined. In a second episode, at 9:30 p.m., Gene and Shannon take everyone along for their his-and-her plastic surgeries.</p>

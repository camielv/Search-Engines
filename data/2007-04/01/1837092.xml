        <p>Until 2006, the biggest problem tourists normally faced in Acapulco were aggressive beggars and hawkers peddling their wares. During the last year, however, violent crime -- much of it believed to be drug-related -- has threatened to curb the booming tourism industry in one of Mexico's most visited resorts.</p>
        <p>Over the course of last year, six severed heads were found -- one of which washed up on the beach. In early February, two Canadian tourists were wounded by stray bullets while lounging in a hotel lobby. Days later, a group dressed in military-looking outfits attacked two police stations, killing five officers and two secretaries. An investigation is under way to determine whether the killings involved the rival Gulf and Sinaloa drug cartels.</p>

        <p>Over the course of last year, six severed heads were found -- one of which washed up on the beach. In early February, two Canadian tourists were wounded by stray bullets while lounging in a hotel lobby. Days later, a group dressed in military-looking outfits attacked two police stations, killing five officers and two secretaries. An investigation is under way to determine whether the killings involved the rival Gulf and Sinaloa drug cartels.</p>
        <p>Now, in an effort to protect visitors streaming into Acapulco for spring break, security measures have been reinforced and 200 federal police have begun patrolling the hotel zone, including by helicopter (above), and setting up road blocks in order to search cars and passengers for weapons and drugs.</p>
        <p>Acapulco's mayor, FÃ©lix Salgado Macedonio, insists the city is safe for tourists. ''Our hotels are full down here with spring break visitors,'' he said, adding that the special police operation downtown has now made Acapulco safer than ever before. ''The violence is totally centered toward the drug traffickers, not tourists. Everyone should come down and see our beautiful beaches. I guarantee one hundred percent safety,'' he said.</p>

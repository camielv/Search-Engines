        <p>A Queens woman accused of smothering her 4-month-old son told investigators that she ''wanted the baby to disappear'' after becoming angry during an argument with her mother, prosecutors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The woman, Yoneli Rodriguez, 21, was charged with second-degree murder and endangering the welfare of a child and was being held without bail after being arraigned last night.</p>
        <p>She smothered her son, Darnel Angel Rodriguez, on Friday morning by pressing a pillow over his head for three minutes, according to a statement from the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown. The statement did not indicate what Ms. Rodriguez and her mother had argued about before the infant died.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rodriguez and her son had been living at the Lincoln Motor Inn on Van Wyck Expressway in Jamaica, a hotel where the city's Department of Homeless Services places families. After smothering Darnel, Ms. Rodriguez took the unconscious child by taxi to Elmhurst Hospital Center, six miles away, instead of to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, which is across the street from the hotel, the district attorney's office said.</p>
        <p>Neighbors at the hotel said yesterday that they had worried Darnel was not being properly fed. Ms. Rodriguez did not know how to prepare his powdered milk, they said, and was eating it herself. Darnel was so small that Ms. Rodriguez had to tie rubber bands around his socks to keep them up, the neighbors said.</p>
        <p>A law enforcement official said it appeared that Ms. Rodriguez had no previous criminal history and had not been under the supervision of the city's Administration for Children's Services, the child welfare agency.</p>
        <p>Case managers with the Department of Homeless Services worked at the Lincoln Motor Inn during the day, where they had regular contact with residents, said Tanya Valle-Batista, a spokeswoman for the agency. Ms. Valle-Batista said that the department was investigating Ms. Rodriguez's case and that she could not comment on it because of confidentiality rules.</p>

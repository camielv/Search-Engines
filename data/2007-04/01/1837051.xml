        <p>My favorite design object would have to be the Egg chair by the Danish architect Arne Jacobsen, who gave me two of them. I went to Denmark in 1959, and before I left, I contacted Jacobsen's office about photographing his work. He took me to see some schools that he had designed, and at one of them, a teacher told her students, ''This is the architect of our school, the famous Arne Jacobsen,'' and the children leapt to their feet to say hello to him. We also went to see a display of 16 Egg chairs that was being installed in the main window of Magasin du Nord, one of the big department stores in Copenhagen. By the next day, the store had sold every one of those chairs. At his office, Jacobsen showed me the model for the chair, which looked like a giant egg from which he had carved the chair's features. I spent a month in Denmark, and when I got back to Los Angeles, a truck arrived with the chairs. They have been in my studio ever since, and I use them abundantly. You can sit in them in so many ways, including sideways; they are so comfortable. The chairs were covered in black leather, but there is a lot of wear and tear with people coming to visit -- everyone loves to sit in them. So we replaced the leather with a green Knoll fabric in the late 1960s. I have a number of other chairs in my studio, including an Eames Lounge Chair, but when I'm being interviewed, I sit in one Egg chair, and the person doing the interview sits in the other.</p>

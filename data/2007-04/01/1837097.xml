        <p>BASICS</p>
        <p>The Bowery is no stranger to hotels, except, of course, they were called flophouses. For several bucks, you once got a wooden cell with a bug-infested bed, bare bulb and chicken wire ceiling. So it's no surprise that some New Yorkers find the opulent 17-story Bowery Hotel a bit galling. The latest venture from Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson, who created the Maritime Hotel and numerous boîtes, the hotel evokes the Gilded Age of red waistcoats, hand-set bricks and wood-paneled elevators. And the views from the upper floors are positively grand. So what if you might have to step over a few vestigial bums to get there?</p>
        <p>THE LOCATION</p>
        <p>Depends on your perspective. It's either next door to a drug rehab center, a men's shelter and a Salvation Army shelter. Or it's near the shuttered CBGB, a rash of shiny condos and a fashionably seedy corridor between the East Village and NoHo.</p>
        <p>THE SCENE</p>
        <p>The handsome lobby, a dark and moody space, feels like an Old World drawing room, with faded tapestries, Moroccan tiles and iron lamps. The hotel was having a soft-opening in mid-March, but that didn't stop a parade of stylehounds from holding court on the tasseled sofas: decorators with Prada man-bags, svelte Italians in fur, Wall Streeters on Blackberries and emo gays in hoodies and skinny jeans.</p>
        <p>THE ROOMS</p>
        <p>Compact but loftlike, thanks to a factory-style window from the hardwood floor to the beaded-board ceiling. From my 11th-floor perch, the East Village looked like a dim valley of grimy walkups, while Midtown glittered like a glassy city on a hill. The room was graceful without being dainty, with décor that suggested Restoration Hardware with a boho-chic twist: accordion brass lamps, old Oriental rugs, sturdy wood tables and hunter-green velvet chairs. There were some nice custom touches -- cast-iron stars on a wall, a recessed headboard -- but not everything fit. The TV dangled over the side table, there was no dresser, and the foot-wide closet was smaller than some flophouse lockers.</p>
        <p>THE BATHROOM</p>
        <p>Reminiscent of a prewar bathhouse, with old marble floor slabs, white subway tiles and antique brass fixtures. Much to my disappointment, there was no tub, but the large, glass-walled stall and rain-forest shower head felt just as decadent. Thick terry bathrobes and minty toiletries from C. O. Bigelow, the Greenwich Village apothecary, completed the old-school look.</p>
        <p>AMENITIES</p>
        <p>Lots of high-tech toys (iPod-powered stereo, flat screen TV, DVD player and free WiFi), but other perks were notably absent. There is no gym, no spa, not even an outdoor pool. On the other hand, there are plenty of places to drink and party. The sprawling second floor is being carved into cocktail lounges, red-brick terraces and V.I.P. rooms.</p>
        <p>ROOM SERVICE</p>
        <p>The restaurant, Gemma, had yet to open, so room service was limited. Still, the staff was prompt, well groomed and friendly. Breakfast -- a tasty spinach frittata and coffee for a reasonable $15 -- arrived just 14 minutes after the order was placed. A broken remote control was quickly replaced. A bucket of ice appeared in under three minutes; the morning paper, even sooner. No word yet, however, on whether the concierge can score reservations for the Waverly Inn, the exclusive restaurant lorded over by the Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, in which Mr. Goode and Mr. MacPherson are partners.</p>
        <p>BOTTOM LINE</p>
        <p>Skid Row on Easy Street. The hotel has 135 rooms. Lower ''preview prices'' are being offered; a standard queen will eventually start at $450, and suites, some with private terraces, hot tubs and outdoor showers, will be considerably more. Bowery Hotel, 335 Bowery (at East Third Street), New York City, (212) 505-9100; www.theboweryhotel.com.</p>

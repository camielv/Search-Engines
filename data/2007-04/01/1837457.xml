        <p>A vacant building near SoHo that was being prepared to be demolished partially collapsed near a busy intersection yesterday, but no one was injured.</p>
        <p>The three-story brick building, at East Houston and Mulberry Streets, was to be the site of an 11-story residential high-rise, officials said.</p>
        <p>The city's Department of Buildings ordered that demolition preparation work at the building be stopped March 22 because of an unspecified violation, according to city records.</p>
        <p>Then on Thursday, the city ordered the building to be braced with cables, records show.</p>
        <p>Those cables were wrapped around the building when it collapsed on two sides about 4 p.m. yesterday.</p>
        <p>''It was a big bang,'' said Joseph Hamboussi, who works at Nolita House restaurant on East Houston Street, between Mulberry and Mott Streets.</p>

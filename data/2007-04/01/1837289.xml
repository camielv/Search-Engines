        <p>AT the Museum of Modern Art one recent morning, Dave Robinson, a professor of eco-adventure tourism at Malaspina University-College near Vancouver, stood engrossed inches from an enormous Jackson Pollock.</p>
        <p>Tall, with graying hair that stops just above his shoulders, Mr. Robinson leaned forward and examined a patch of the canvas crisscrossed with the artist's trademark streaks and dribbles.</p>
        <p>Then something caught his eye. He raised his digital camera and -- snap. Then he moved a couple of feet to the left and snapped again. And then he did that again. And again.</p>
        <p>None of the other visitors to the museum paid much attention. In fact, all around him, people were photographing Pollock's works, sometimes posing alongside the paintings, as though they were on the Staten Island Ferry or in the middle of Times Square.</p>
        <p>Diana Simpson, the museum's director of visitor services, said the number of people photographing art had risen in the past few years, with the proliferation of digital cameras and cellphones with cameras. The practice can be observed at other city museums, which generally allow photography but prohibit use of a flash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson said he was only trying to enhance his experience, photographing the paintings so he could study them in detail later. In four days, he had taken 150 photographs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Cloisters, the Cooper-Hewitt and the Guggenheim (where his battery ran out). Pollock is one of his favorite artists, and he already relished the thought of showing his photographs to his 13-year-old son at home.</p>
        <p>''I am going to blow his socks off with this stuff,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson's colleague Justin McGrail, a professor of art history at Malaspina, had an antique-looking Pentax, loaded with slide film, slung around his neck. Mr. McGrail said he took photographs to show his students the scale of the originals. But he also admitted to posing with his wife by the swirling brushstrokes of ''The Starry Night'' by van Gogh.</p>
        <p>''Everyone knows that image, but most people have never seen the painting,'' Mr. McGrail said. ''I suppose the point of taking a photo of a painting is to say: 'This isn't a mass-produced reproduction. It's not an image on a Starbucks mug. It's an original reproduction.' ''</p>
        <p>The photography is not popular with everyone. One guard said that ''real art lovers'' occasionally complained. The number of people he has to scold for using a flash is ''uncountable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At ''The Starry Night,'' on the museum's fifth floor, two Brazilian men in their 20s asked visitors to move so they could take turns having their photograph taken between ''The Starry Night'' and the artist's ''Olive Trees.'' Said Samael Leite, a 23-year-old from Sao Lourenco, ''It will show our family in Brazil that we have been here.''</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>''The Dinner Party,'' Judy Chicago's landmark multimedia installation celebrating the role of women in Western civilization, has moved to a permanent home in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. The work features a table with 39 place settings, each representing a woman in history. Smaller parties can be seated at these nearby restaurants.</p>
        <p>BEAST  (718) 399-6855; 638 Bergen Street (Vanderbilt Avenue); $; $25 and Under: 4/20/05.  The name is inspired by the fondness of the owner, Deborah Bicknese, for mythological monsters. The menu offers inventive plates that Ms. Bicknese and her co-chef, Megan Fisk, call tapas. But most of them -- like the light potato, mushroom, spinach and egg tortilla and the lager braised short ribs -- are large enough to pass around the table.</p>
        <p>CHRISTIE'S JAMAICAN PATTIES  (718) 636-9746; 387 Flatbush Avenue (Carlton Avenue); $; $25 and Under: 7/19/06.  This 40-year-old Prospect Heights stalwart recently moved half a block closer to Prospect Park on Flatbush Avenue. The meat fillings at Christie's are encased in a turmeric-yellow pastry, made with a fair amount of suet that splits into layers and shards when you bite into it, revealing the moist, nearly puréed meat filling within.</p>
        <p>Beyond the patties, there is a full menu of jerk chicken, curried goat, braised oxtails and an assortment of baked goods.</p>
        <p>FRANNY'S  (718) 230-0221; 295 Flatbush Avenue (Prospect Place); $; $25 and Under: 6/16/04.  Franny's belongs to a new wave of pizzerias where high-quality ingredients, like house-cured meats and farmstead cheeses, elevate humble pies. The nicely charred bottoms and puffy rims taste faintly of wood smoke, and thin centers hold their own against superior toppings.</p>
        <p>In addition to pizzas, Franny's serves crostini, house-cured meats like pancetta, soppressata, coppa and mortadella, and small plates like wood-roasted broccoli or leeks.</p>
        <p>GARDEN CAFE  (718) 857-8863; 620 Vanderbilt Avenue (Prospect Place); $$; Diner's Journal: 6/25/04.  This tiny spot has a small but worshipful following. John Policastro's menu is ever-changing, the napkins are thick, the service by his wife, Camille, is warm and the portions are generous.</p>
        <p>The current menu includes asparagus soup with braised leeks and basil cream, and guinea fowl breast with sweet and sour cabbage and green onion mashed potatoes.</p>
        <p>RESTAURANT SORREL  (718) 622-1190; 605 Carlton Avenue (St. Marks Avenue); $$; Article: 8/31/05.  Restaurant Sorrel is an airy setting for a market-driven menu created by Alexandre Tchistov, formerly of 360 in Red Hook. Among the current offerings are roasted beets with horseradish goat cheese and walnuts, and pan-seared sea scallops with enoki mushrooms and pea shoots.</p>

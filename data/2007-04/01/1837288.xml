        <p>Row a Boat, but Not Yours</p>
        <p>Q. There are two lakes at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. I know I've seen boats on Meadow Lake, the larger one, during events. Am I allowed to fish from my canoe on this lake? What exactly are the rules?</p>
        <p>A. Sorry, no fishing, and no private boats on Meadow Lake or the smaller one, Willow Lake. (The Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival, an annual regatta in August, is an exception to the ban on private boats.)</p>

        <p>Row a Boat, but Not Yours</p>
        <p>Q. There are two lakes at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. I know I've seen boats on Meadow Lake, the larger one, during events. Am I allowed to fish from my canoe on this lake? What exactly are the rules?</p>
        <p>A. Sorry, no fishing, and no private boats on Meadow Lake or the smaller one, Willow Lake. (The Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival, an annual regatta in August, is an exception to the ban on private boats.)</p>
        <p>However, there are several opportunities to get out on the water in Flushing Meadows, Abigail Lootens, a spokeswoman for the Parks Department, said in an e-mail message.</p>
        <p>A parks concession on Meadow Lake offers rowboats and paddle boats for rent during the spring, summer and early fall. And two nonprofit organizations run programs from the Meadow Lake Boathouse: the American Small Craft Association, known as Tasca, which offers sailing and boating classes, and Row NY, which provides free youth training in competitive rowing.</p>
        <p>In addition, Ms. Lootens said, canoeing tours on Willow Lake are being planned for this spring by the city's Urban Park Rangers.</p>
        <p>He Lived Up to the Hype</p>
        <p>Q. This is my favorite season because the circus is back at Madison Square Garden. Could you write about Tody Hamilton, the famous promoter for Barnum?</p>
        <p>A. He was never a performer, a ringmaster, a clown or a sideshow act, but William Hamilton (1847-1916), known as Tody, was one of the most beloved circus personalities of his time.</p>
        <p>As chief publicist for the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus from 1881 to 1907, he was the MOST STUPENDOUS SOURCE of SUPERLATIVE, SPECTACULAR CIRCUS SYNTAX in the ENTIRE HISTORY of PRESS AGENTRY on THIS PLANET!</p>
        <p>If Hamilton, a native New Yorker, didn't actually invent overwrought alliterative circus prose or the florid three-ring poster, he certainly took credit for it. He so perfected that kind of lingo -- ''millionaire menageries,'' for example -- that for years after his death, his name was used, by the writer Christopher Morley and others, as a metaphor for hyperbole.</p>
        <p>His publicity stunts were legendary: staging a tug of war between an elephant and a few roustabouts; testing the effect of musical instruments on a cage of kangaroos; organizing a midgets' strike; feeding two live lambs to hungry lions and leopards. One quotation attributed to him is: ''To state a fact in ordinary language is to permit doubt concerning the statement.''</p>
        <p>But perhaps Hamilton's most remarkable claim came in an interview shortly before his death: During all his years with Barnum &amp; Bailey, he never once saw the show.</p>
        <p>Bridge Work</p>
        <p>Q. I travel over the Willis Avenue Bridge from Manhattan to the Bronx, and until recently there was a section of iron bridge on a barge in the East River. Then one day it was gone. Where did it go? Why was it there in the first place?</p>
        <p>A. That piece was part of the new 145th Street Bridge on the Harlem River, which reopened March 22, said Craig Chin, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation.</p>
        <p>The truss for the $80 million swing bridge was built in upstate New York and floated in one piece down the Hudson, around Manhattan and up the East River to the Harlem River. The bridge had been closed since Nov. 1; the old one was removed by barge to New Jersey for recycling.</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 8, 2007, Sunday  A report in the F.Y.I. column last Sunday about a publicist for the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus from 1881 to 1907 misstated his given name. He was Richard Hamilton, not William. (He went by Tody.)</p>

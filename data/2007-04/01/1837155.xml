        <p>WHEN local taxes grow so burdensome that they drive away the young professionals that businesses need, a region loses competitiveness. That's a threat now facing Long Island.</p>
        <p>Long Island shares the problem of high taxes with many suburban counties throughout the country. But two stand apart: Fairfax and Loudoun Counties in northern Virginia have far lower property taxes and the differences are significant. Local governments spend 45 percent, or $1,722, more per capita on Long Island than in northern Virginia.</p>
        <p>Many have suggested that a more streamlined government -- Long Island has 439 cities, towns, villages, school districts and special districts; northern Virginia has 17 -- could reduce Long Island's costs and address problems more effectively. But some fear that a centralized government would provide worse services and be less responsive to citizens' concerns. Our poll revealed, on the contrary, that residents of northern Virginia are more satisfied with the quality of government services, including schools, and have more favorable attitudes toward local government and their access to it.</p>
        <p>As Long Islanders discuss how to remain competitive, the situation in northern Virginia offers new and provocative ideas.</p>

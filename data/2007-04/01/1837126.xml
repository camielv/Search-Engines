        <p>Back when it was one of the most overhyped new shows of the season, ''30 ROCK'' wasn't quite as good as people said it was. The strain of trying to be an alt-sitcom and still attract an audience was too apparent. But as the season went on, and Tina Fey grew more comfortable playing herself, and Alec Baldwin and Jane Krakowski were reliably funny as the preening network executive and the neurotic star, and Jack McBrayer made something brilliant out of the fey NBC page Kenneth, the show got better and better -- and the talk gradually subsided. Then it went away for a few weeks. It returns to the schedule on Thursday (NBC, 8:40 p.m.), and while the writers'-room high jinks are still dull, the plot involving Jack (Mr. Baldwin) using Kenneth as his Mata Hari in a battle with a gay network rival (Will Arnett) is the show at its giggly best.</p>
        <p>Andy Baldwin is a ruggedly handsome Navy lieutenant. He's a doctor (Duke undergrad; University of California, San Francisco, medical school). He's stationed in Honolulu. He's a triathlete. And to make it all just a teensy bit better, the award he won from an endurance-sports group wasn't for his athletic prowess; it was humanitarian of the year. But there's one less-than-perfect thing about this paragon: He's also a reality-TV star. Lieutenant Baldwin wields the roses in ''THE BACHELOR: OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'' which begins Monday (ABC, 9:45 p.m.) with the traditional gathering of the 25 highly made-up bachelorettes, including the de rigueur drunken bachelorette falling down. Best pre-rose-ceremony moment: when one of the women sings the national anthem to the lieutenant. And damned if he doesn't tear up.</p>

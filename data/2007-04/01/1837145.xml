        <p>The question posed in Robin Marantz Henig's article ''Darwin's God'' (March 4) may be answered in Richard Panek's article. Rational organisms require explanations, yet science has been incapable of providing an explanation of how the physical universe came to exist. No wonder that man has found it necessary to believe in gods, a belief not much removed from accepting that something called ''dark matter'' (which can't be demonstrated either) comprises 96 percent of the universe.</p>

        <p>The question posed in Robin Marantz Henig's article ''Darwin's God'' (March 4) may be answered in Richard Panek's article.

        <p>In Henig's article, we are offered two choices: religion is either an ''evolutionary adaptation'' or a ''neurological accident.'' In either case, religion is viewed as a preference for the unreal and the counterintuitive, which confounds logic, and we seem to be invited to summon the resolve to slough it off and submit to the rationality of science. Yet when science informs us that physical reality consists of elementary particles with no measurable structure and that empty space is a flickering m√©lange of virtual particles that don't exist, except when they do, we are presented with a picture that is also unreal and counterintuitive and confounds logic. God may be invoked because the explanatory power of science ultimately breaks down, leaving a vacuum that must be filled.</p>

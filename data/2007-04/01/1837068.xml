        <p>It used to be that the only way you could see Philip Johnson's Glass House was to make his acquaintance. Now all you have to do is make a reservation. The legendary Modernist architect, who died in 2005, donated his New Canaan, Conn., country retreat -- which includes three vernacular buildings and 10 structures designed by Johnson in addition to the glass-and-steel pavilion that made him famous -- to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which will open the 47-acre site to the public (by appointment only) in June. The site's mission is to become a model for the preservation of Modernism and a laboratory for new talent, inspired by the example of Johnson and his companion, the curator David Whitney.

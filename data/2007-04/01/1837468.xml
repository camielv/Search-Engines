        <p>The sky over Fairfield County could grow noisier if a planned new route for planes landing at La Guardia Airport is approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
        <p>The new route would have planes coming from the north and west cross over lower Fairfield County and then fly along the coasts of Stamford and Greenwich. The F.A.A. announced its preference for the route on March 23.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. said the new route would help eliminate 12 million minutes of delays a year at the major airports in New York City, Newark and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Shifting arrivals to La Guardia more to the east ''gives us additional departure routes out of the major airports in the Philadelphia and New York metropolitan areas,'' said Steven Kelley, the administration's manager of airspace redesign.</p>
        <p>Greenwich's first selectman, James A. Lash, said he was concerned about the added noise the new route would bring over his town. He said the F.A.A. had ignored suggestions the town had made to move planes away from the coast, over Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>''Nobody is opposed to a more efficient and safe air traffic system,'' Mr. Lash said. ''But we are losing confidence that the F.A.A. is taking our concern about noise mitigation seriously.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelley said some flights could take a route that eventually goes farther from the coast. ''But at some point, the airplanes still have to cross over land to get to the water,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lash said the town would hire a consultant to study the new route further.</p>
        <p>Representative Christopher Shays, a Republican who represents Fairfield County, said the new route would adversely affect residents' quality of life.</p>
        <p>''The problem is that the F.A.A. only has mandates for safety and efficiency,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelley conceded that the agency was not looking at specific ways to mitigate noise along the new route.</p>
        <p>''We're sensitive to the concerns, but they certainly don't trigger any requirements,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelley said there would be a public meeting on the new route on April 24 at 6 p.m. at the Holiday Inn Select in Stamford. He said a final decision would most likely come in August, but added that any new route might not be fully in place until 2011.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shays said he expected a large turnout at the meeting.</p>
        <p>''The law is not in our favor on this,'' he said. ''But hopefully a large number of people can put pressure on the F.A.A. to make a change.''</p>
        <p>Those Vanished Tollbooths May Be Headed Back</p>
        <p>More than two decades after tollbooths were taken down in the state, a movement to charge drivers once again to use highways took a step forward last Monday when the South Western Regional Planning Agency, which represents several towns and cities in lower Fairfield County, endorsed studying an electronic toll system.</p>
        <p>Under the system, called congestion pricing, drivers would be charged higher fees during rush hours. Floyd Lapp, executive director of the agency, said it would work similar to E-ZPass and could possibly be connected to it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lapp said the system would encourage drivers to use public transportation, and thereby improve air quality. He said it would also help pay for road improvements.</p>
        <p>In places where congestion pricing has been used, there has been a 15 to 25 percent decrease in rush-hour traffic, Mr. Lapp said.</p>
        <p>However, for the system to be successful, the state must have enough trains and buses, he said. ''Those people that decide to not take their cars anymore must have a good other choice,'' Mr. Lapp said.</p>
        <p>He said it was too early to say how much drivers would be charged, or how much the system would cost.</p>
        <p>Wesport's police chief, Alfred R. Fiore, said he was concerned that charging more at peak hours would add too much traffic to local roads. ''We're bursting at the seams already,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The State Department of Transportation has an application pending with the Federal Highway Administration for a grant to finance the study. A bill is also waiting to go before the state legislature that would help pay for it.</p>
        <p>Carmine P. Trotta, an assistant planning director for the Transportation Department, said a study would take about two years and cost several million dollars. ''We're about five years away from being able to have a system on the roads,'' he said.</p>

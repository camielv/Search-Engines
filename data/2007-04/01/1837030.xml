        <p>I had a good laugh when I read one sentence in your review of Barry Glassner's ''Gospel of Food'' (March 11): ''Like a magician with a long act and a few great tricks, Glassner makes it worth sitting through the obvious sleight of hand to get to the good parts.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I had a good laugh when I read one sentence in your review of Barry Glassner's ''Gospel of Food'' (March 11): ''Like a magician with a long act and a few great tricks, Glassner makes it worth sitting through the obvious sleight of hand to get to the good parts.''</p>
        <p>I don't know if your reviewer had a clue, but Barry was a teenage magician, which is how he and I became acquainted many years ago (he in Virginia and I in New York, as members of a national young magicians' club whose ''magazine'' we wrote for and edited).</p>
        <p>It doesn't take my former ''mind-reading'' skills to know he probably got a hoot out of that line too.</p>

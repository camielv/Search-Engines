        <p>Duncan for 3</p>
        <p>Known for his work in the paint, Spurs forward/center TIM DUNCAN showed his versatility Wednesday in a victory against the Hornets when he made a 3-pointer in the second quarter with the shot clock expiring.</p>
        <p>It was the first 3-pointer of the season for Duncan, a 7-footer from Wake Forest.</p>
        <p>''If they allowed me to, during the All-Star game I'd join the 3-point shooting contest,'' Duncan told reporters after the game.</p>
        <p>Duncan may want to hold off though; it was the 23rd 3-pointer of his career. His teammate BRENT BARRY made five in the game to give him 1,291 in his career.</p>
        <p>King James's Castle</p>
        <p>LeBRON JAMES seems to be all about suburbia of late. Not only is he the new spokesman for Cub Cadet riding lawn mowers (take a peek at the advertisement on YouTube), but he is also building a huge new house in Bath Township, Ohio, about 20 minutes south of Cleveland.</p>
        <p>According to The Akron Beacon Journal, the house will be more than 34,000 square feet and will have a two-lane bowling alley, a casino (no one seems quite sure how that is going to work), a barbershop, an aquarium, a recording studio, a six-car garage and a sports bar.</p>
        <p>The house will come within 800 feet of 19 other houses. The neighbors are already complaining about people snapping pictures of the construction site.</p>
        <p>The Ol√© Defense</p>
        <p>On Thursday night on TNT, a commercial was broadcast showing a film of Red Auerbach discussing the virtues of team defense. It was unfortunate timing, coming during the Phoenix Suns-Golden State Warriors matchup, a game in which the Warriors scored 45 points in the first quarter and the halftime score was 77-63.</p>
        <p>While Warriors guard JASON RICHARDSON, above, was on his way to a team-record eight 3-pointers and a game-high 36 points, the Suns didn't punish Golden State for venturing into the paint. The Warriors shot only 3 free throws in the first half and 14 in the game.</p>

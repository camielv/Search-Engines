        <p>Re ''The Smithsonian Challenge'' (editorial, March 27), about the search for a new leader of this public institution:</p>
        <p>''Public'' at the Smithsonian has meant free admission. But by not charging a fee, the Smithsonian is out of step with other countries' great national museums, like the Louvre. The Smithsonian museums cannot sustain their well-deserved reputation unless they are fully financed.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Smithsonian Challenge'' (editorial, March 27), about the search for a new leader of this public institution:</p>
        <p>''Public'' at the Smithsonian has meant free admission. But by not charging a fee, the Smithsonian is out of step with other countries' great national museums, like the Louvre. The Smithsonian museums cannot sustain their well-deserved reputation unless they are fully financed.</p>
        <p>In choosing the next secretary, the Smithsonian's governing board -- the regents -- should select a person who is bold enough to push for a wisely constructed, tiered admission fee.</p>
        <p>The new secretary must persuade visitors that the quality of the experience merits a modest charge. Even more challenging, the secretary must convince Congress that it would be self-defeating if income from admission were offset by a corresponding decrease in taxpayer financing.</p>
        <p>James Lowell Gibbs Jr.  Stanford, Calif., March 28, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is trustee emeritus for the advisory board of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art.</p>

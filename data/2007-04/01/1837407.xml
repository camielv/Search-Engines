        <p>Dina Matos McGreevey, estranged wife of former New Jersey Gov James McGreevey, plans television appearances and tour for her new book, Silent Partner: A Memoir of My Marriage, promising to tell 'truth behind the lies' about McGreevey's homosexuality (S)</p>

        <p>For those wondering just what Dina Matos McGreevey was thinking as she gazed, wide-eyed and smiling, at her husband while he was informing the world that he was a gay American, fear not. The estranged wife of former Gov. James E. McGreevey has a book coming out in May promising to tell ''the truth behind the lies,'' and a tour to follow, including appearances on ''Good Morning America'' and Oprah Winfrey's TV show.</p>
        <p>Exactly what she will say on any of these programs is anyone's guess. In an e-mail message, a spokeswoman for Hyperion, the publisher for her book, said Ms. Matos McGreevey was scheduled to appear on May 1, to coincide with the book's release. (A spokeswoman for Ms. Winfrey said only that she was scheduled to appear in a coming show.) Ms. Matos McGreevey will then sit for a two-part interview on ''Good Morning America'' on May 2 and 3.</p>

        <p>For those wondering just what Dina Matos McGreevey was thinking as she gazed, wide-eyed and smiling, at her husband while he was informing the world that he was a gay American, fear not. The estranged wife of former Gov. James E. McGreevey has a book coming out in May promising to tell ''the truth behind the lies,'' and a tour to follow, including appearances on ''Good Morning America'' and Oprah Winfrey's TV show.</p>
        <p>Exactly what she will say on any of these programs is anyone's guess. In an e-mail message, a spokeswoman for Hyperion, the publisher for her book, said Ms. Matos McGreevey was scheduled to appear on May 1, to coincide with the book's release. (A spokeswoman for Ms. Winfrey said only that she was scheduled to appear in a coming show.) Ms. Matos McGreevey will then sit for a two-part interview on ''Good Morning America'' on May 2 and 3.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey sat with Ms. Winfrey last fall in support of his book, ''The Confession'' (Regan Books).</p>
        <p>To date, Ms. Matos McGreevey has not spoken publicly about the governor's gasp-inducing announcement in August 2004, or about her marriage. But many sordid tales have spun out from that day. Mr. McGreevey, who resigned in November 2004, appointed the man identified as his lover as an adviser. The man, an Israeli named Golan Cipel, maintains that he was the victim of sexual harassment and assault (though no charges were filed).</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey later divulged more details in his book, including tales of assignations with anonymous men at rest stops on the Garden State Parkway and bookstore-cruising in New York.</p>
        <p>Recently, Mr. McGreevey filed divorce papers in Union County seeking the court's input on custody of the couple's 5-year-old daughter, support and visitation.</p>
        <p>For those not yet sated by coverage of the double life of the governor, Ms. McGreevey's book, ''Silent Partner: A Memoir of My Marriage,'' promises a new angle: the woman scorned for another man.</p>
        <p>''She didn't know that his life, and thus their marriage, were built on a foundation of lies,'' reads the publisher's promotional copy, ''that his past was littered with casual sexual encounters in seedy bookstores and public parks; or that, by his own admission, he began an adulterous affair with another man while she was in the hospital awaiting the birth of their child. 'Could I have known?' she asks. 'How could I have known?' ''</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 8, 2007, Sunday  A headline on a report in The Week column last Sunday about the book written by Dina Matos McGreevey misstated her marital status. She is the estranged wife of former Gov. James E. McGreevey, not his ''ex-wife.''</p>

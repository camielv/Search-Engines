        <p>Some residents of Bronx strongly oppose plan by Metropolitan Transportation Authority and New York City Transportation Department to speed up bus traffic by designating one lane of Pelham Parkway exclusively for buses; pilot program calls for new bus route in each borough that would make express stops along busy thoroughfares; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Almost every day during the morning and afternoon rush, Pelham Parkway in the Bronx becomes ensnarled, with several lanes of car traffic crawling toward or away from Manhattan. On a recent morning, motorists gritted their teeth behind the wheels of delivery trucks and honking sedans. So a plan to seize one of those lanes and devote it during much of the day to buses has incensed some residents.</p>
        <p>At issue is a plan that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city's Transportation Department have been fashioning since 2004, with the goal of speeding up notoriously slow bus trips.

        <p>Almost every day during the morning and afternoon rush, Pelham Parkway in the Bronx becomes ensnarled, with several lanes of car traffic crawling toward or away from Manhattan. On a recent morning, motorists gritted their teeth behind the wheels of delivery trucks and honking sedans. So a plan to seize one of those lanes and devote it during much of the day to buses has incensed some residents.</p>
        <p>At issue is a plan that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city's Transportation Department have been fashioning since 2004, with the goal of speeding up notoriously slow bus trips. The pilot program, set to begin at the end of the year, calls for a new bus route in each borough that would make express stops along busy thoroughfares in lanes given over exclusively to buses.</p>
        <p>After a series of public hearings, the route chosen for the Bronx was Fordham Road and Pelham Parkway, which merge into a major east-west corridor through the borough. On the eastbound side of Pelham Parkway, one of three traffic lanes would be devoted to the new rapid bus from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>The choice greatly worries some local residents.</p>
        <p>''Pelham Parkway right now is very congested,'' said John Fratta, the district manager of Community Board 11, which serves communities including Pelham Parkway, Pelham Gardens and Morris Park. ''You take a traffic lane out of service for this rapid bus program, you're just going to create gridlock throughout the whole strip. It makes no sense to us at all.''</p>
        <p>Last month, the community board voted unanimously against the proposal, although its vote is only a recommendation.</p>
        <p>The transportation authority maintains that the five new routes were studied and selected carefully, having been winnowed from 36 possibilities in the city. To transportation officials, the gains from their Bronx choice promise to be great. Already, local buses on Fordham Road and Pelham Parkway are tied with the buses of the Grand Concourse as the busiest in the Bronx, ferrying 42,000 passengers a day.</p>
        <p>The new rapid bus would travel from Co-op City to 207th Street and Broadway in Manhattan, making only about 10 stops along the route, mostly at busy intersections with subway entrances. Leaving roughly every four minutes during peak hours, the new buses would be a ''vast improvement in dependability,'' said Ted Orosz, the project manager, who noted that similar rapid transit buses have been successful in cities like Boston, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Community members remain unswayed by the transportation authority's case.</p>
        <p>''They said, 'Well, this works in Vancouver,' '' said Vincent Prezioso, director of the Northeast Bronx Association. ''So I said, 'Go to Canada!' That's not Pelham Parkway.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Orosz contended that all five new express routes, which are to be established by the end of 2008, will be a boon in the long run, especially with another million people predicted to be living in New York by 2030.</p>
        <p>''If they all drive, the city will come to a stop,'' Mr. Orosz said. ''By enhancing the surface system, the idea is to slow the growth of automobile traffic.''</p>

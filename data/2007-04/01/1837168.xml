        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Unfurling the Hidden Work of a Lifetime'' by Steven Henry Madoff [March 18]:</p>
        <p>As one of Still's daughters, I would like to clear up an anecdote recounted by Henry Hopkins, a former museum director. He said that Still was terrified when his father sent him into a well they were digging on a farm. Still was actually sent down to retrieve an unexploded stick of dynamite. Neither his father nor the two farmhands would do it. So, angered that his father would order him, his only son, to do this dangerous job, he got the dud. Still was never terrified of anything. The fact that he took on the New York art world is proof of his courage and determination.</p>

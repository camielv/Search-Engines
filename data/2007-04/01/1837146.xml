      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Kudos to Jeffrey Rosen (March 11) for reminding us that a form of phrenology is alive and well in the 21st century. Apparently there are some who posit that because a particular brain center for thought or emotion does or does not light up, we can draw a definitive conclusion about behavior. Let's get away from looking for easy answers and bumps on (or inside) the head to explain why we act as we do. The world, and we, are much more complex than that.</p>

        <p>Nissequogue, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The problem with imaging studies is that we do not have an accepted theory that relates brain phenomena to mental phenomena. With the possible exception of some simple sensory systems and perhaps aspects of speech, there is not a one-to-one relation between brain processes and behavior, much less thought. There is no doubt that a tumor can diminish the capacity to evaluate and respond to an internal impulse, but whatever the definitions of free will and legal culpability, they don't come close to the complexity of what is really going on.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Williams Beats Sharapova, Again Leaving Little Doubt,'' March 28: Just because black athletes have a lot of money does not mean they (or their families) are always treated well or respected for their work as athletes. Rather, they are often stereotyped or targeted for their ''gaudy'' displays. Better reporting on Serena Williams's ''sense of alienation'' or discomfort might focus on racism within American society and the institution of sports itself. Or it might just discuss why she won.</p>

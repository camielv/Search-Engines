        <p>In Australia, Prime Minister John Howard is facing accusations that the relatively brief sentence and yearlong order of silence on Guantánamo detainee David Hicks resulted from governmental pressure, charges he dismissed as ''absurd.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Howard is facing a tough re-election fight, with the vote slated for this year. Mr. Hicks had already become an issue in the campaign, and Mr. Howard had made it clear to the Bush administration, including in direct talks with Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, how important he felt it was for Mr. Hicks to be returned home.</p>

        <p>In Australia, Prime Minister John Howard is facing accusations that the relatively brief sentence and yearlong order of silence on Guantánamo detainee David Hicks resulted from governmental pressure, charges he dismissed as ''absurd.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Howard is facing a tough re-election fight, with the vote slated for this year. Mr. Hicks had already become an issue in the campaign, and Mr. Howard had made it clear to the Bush administration, including in direct talks with Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, how important he felt it was for Mr. Hicks to be returned home.</p>
        <p>''Nine months, a gag order for one year -- all overlap the coming elections,'' Mr. Hicks's father, Terry, said in a telephone interview from Adelaide. ''I'm very suspicious.''</p>
        <p>Bob Brown, the leader of the Greens Party and a federal senator, said, ''This is more about saving Mr. Howard's political hide than about justice for Hicks.''</p>
        <p>He added in a statement, ''It is clearly a political fix arranged between Mr. Howard and the Bush administration to shut up Hicks until after the election in November.''</p>
        <p>In comments reported by the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday, Mr. Howard said, ''We didn't impose the sentence, the sentence was imposed by the military commission and the plea bargain was worked out between the military prosecution and Mr. Hicks's lawyers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Howard added that the suggestion ''that it has something to do with the Australian elections is absurd.''</p>
        <p>In the telephone interview on Saturday from Adelaide, Mr. Hicks's father said there were other aspects of the plea bargain that troubled him. It was clear to him, based on his last conversation with his son at Guantánamo last week, that he was pleading guilty in order to get out of detention there. ''He told me he'd had it, he couldn't take it any longer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hicks also said he did not understand how his son could say he was not abused, noting that David had included descriptions of abusive treatment in an affidavit filed with a British court, in support of an application for citizenship.</p>
        <p>Among the episodes recounted in the document was one that he said occurred before he arrived at Guantánamo. In a 10-hour interrogation, he said he was ''hit in the back of the head with the butt of a rifle several times (hard enough to knock me over), slapped in the back of the head, kicked, stepped on, and spat on.''</p>

        <p>Editorial holds Connecticut Judiciary Committee should approve bill that would allow same-sex couples to marry; holds, however, that it is important to recognize bill's limits</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>This past Monday, Connecticut debated the meaning of marriage before a packed Judiciary Committee hearing that lasted until nearly midnight. More than 50 people testified for and against a bill that, if passed, would make Connecticut the second state after Massachusetts to allow same-sex couples to marry. The bill takes a step beyond the state's current law, passed in 2005, that extended civil unions to gay couples.</p>
        <p>Gays are the only group for whom the civil union law is intended. This being the case, the law does little more than create a second-class form of matrimony, which is not only entirely unnecessary but also counterproductive.</p>
      </block>
      <block class="online_lead_paragraph">
        <p>Should the gay marriage law pass in Connecticut, it would be a statement that the stability, commitment and love between same-sex partners is worthy of respect.</p>

        <p>This past Monday, Connecticut debated the meaning of marriage before a packed Judiciary Committee hearing that lasted until nearly midnight. More than 50 people testified for and against a bill that, if passed, would make Connecticut the second state after Massachusetts to allow same-sex couples to marry. The bill takes a step beyond the state's current law, passed in 2005, that extended civil unions to gay couples.</p>
        <p>Gays are the only group for whom the civil union law is intended. This being the case, the law does little more than create a second-class form of matrimony, which is not only entirely unnecessary but also counterproductive.</p>
        <p>The sacred and ordinary act of two people pledging their fidelity to one another strengthens the institution of marriage, and whether or not the two people are of the same sex is beside the point. Thousands of same-sex couples have married nearby Massachusetts, yet, somehow, the Earth continues to orbit the sun.</p>
        <p>The Judiciary Committee and the legislature should approve this bill. Even so, it is important to recognize its limits. Changing the law will not bestow upon gay couples any more legal rights than they currently possess under the state's civil union law. Unless Congress changes federal statutes, same-sex partners who wed will never gain the legal status bestowed upon heterosexual couples, who have the automatic protection of hundreds of laws the moment they say ''I do.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the proposal is significant, not least because it involves a quintessential American value: equality. Should the gay marriage law pass in Connecticut, it would be a statement that the stability, commitment and love between same-sex partners is worthy of respect.</p>
        <p>That's worth voting for. Gov. M. Jodi Rell, who has threatened to veto the bill if it passes, should rethink her opposition.</p>

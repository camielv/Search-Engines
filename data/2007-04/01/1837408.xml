        <p>After a decade of abuse from the weather and damage from the sun, more than 11,000 of the 12,000 signs bearing road names over intersections are being replaced by the State Department of Transportation.</p>
        <p>The project, to cost $6 million, is expected to be completed by Memorial Day.</p>
        <p>The green signs with white, reflective lettering are a staple on New Jersey's roads. Erin Phalon, a spokeswoman for the department, said many motorists had complained that the signs had faded, making them difficult to read.</p>
        <p>''Many aren't as legible as we'd like,'' she said. ''Having clearer street signs will increase safety and convenience for motorists.''</p>
        <p>The signs extend over the middle of intersections and typically mark streets that intersect with highways, Ms. Phalon said. She said that an inventory was taken last year and that the replacement began earlier this year. The signs are being replaced during off-peak periods to avoid causing major delays on roads.</p>
        <p>The new signs -- manufactured by the state with materials from the 3M Company -- are expected to last seven years, as were the old signs.</p>

        <p>THE WEEK</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 8, 2007, Sunday  A report in The Week column last Sunday about the replacement of faded state road signs misstated the completion date for the project. Statewide, it is scheduled to be completed by early 2008, not by Memorial Day this year. Completion by Memorial Day is expected only in Monmouth and Ocean Counties. Because of an editing error, the report also misstated the signs' longevity. They have a seven-year warranty, not a seven-year life span.</p>

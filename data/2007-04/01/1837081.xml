        <p>I am Patty.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>I am Patty.</p>
        <p>I am much older than 6.</p>
        <p>I am a city grown-up.</p>
        <p>I live in my own apartment.</p>
        <p>But one night I got to sleep in a store called Hastens. They sell beds.</p>
        <p>Hastens is enormously enormous.</p>
        <p>And it has maybe 14 beds.</p>
        <p>There is a bed that goes up and down and wriggles all your protoplasm when you push a button.1</p>
        <p>And there is a round bed.2</p>
        <p>And there is a bed that comes with two little tables on each side so you can have a place for all the things you have to have like your root beer.3</p>
        <p>There is even a crib for a baby but I am not a baby. As I said, I am much older than 6.</p>
        <p>And did I tell you there is a bed that costs $59,750?4</p>
        <p>No, no, no. The mattress is not stuffed with saffron or hard-to-get stem cells or $59,750. It is stuffed with genuine horsehair, which, you must understand, is the best stuff for sleeping on.5</p>
        <p>Especially if you are a horse.</p>
        <p>Still, if you do not share my opinion that $59,750 is a lot of money for something you keep on the floor, then I am guessing you are the big boss of a hedge fund or that you live among the haut monde.</p>
        <p>Paul is my main friend.</p>
        <p>Paul likes to watch television.</p>
        <p>So we hop up on a bed that has a giant TV in front of it.</p>
        <p>And we watch a movie called ''Sleepless in Seattle.''</p>
        <p>It is a very good movie.</p>
        <p>Though, between you and me, it has nothing whatsoever to do with slumber.</p>
        <p>Do you know what else?</p>
        <p>We order Japanese food and eat it in bed when we watch TV.</p>
        <p>Please do not tell the people at HÃƒ</p>

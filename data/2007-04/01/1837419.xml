        <p>Buffeted once again by bad news about his disgraced former police commissioner, Rudolph W. Giuliani said Saturday that he should have looked more closely into the commissioner's background and acknowledged that it may cause voters to question his judgment.</p>
        <p>The New York Times reported Friday that Mr. Giuliani may have been told that the former commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, had a relationship to a company suspected of having ties to organized crime -- an accusation the company denies -- even before he chose Mr. Kerik to head the New York Police Department.</p>
        <p>''I think I should have done a better job of investigating him, vetting him, however you want to describe that,'' Mr. Giuliani said in his first extended public comments on the latest revelations about Mr. Kerik. ''It's my responsibility, and I've learned from it,'' he said, adding, ''I'll make sure that I do a much better job of checking into people in the future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik, who has been under federal investigation in recent months, turned down a plea deal several weeks ago in which federal prosecutors offered to allow him to admit to tax fraud and conspiring to eavesdrop illegally in exchange for a two-year prison term, according to a person briefed on the case. Charges against Mr. Kerik are possible in the coming weeks, several people briefed on the case have said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani made his remarks to reporters here Saturday after addressing members of the Club for Growth, a conservative economic advocacy group.</p>
        <p>Asked how Mr. Kerik's troubles might influence voters' views of Mr. Giuliani as he runs for president, he said: ''People have a right to question my judgment. They have a right to question everything about me. And then they have to look at the things that I've done that were successful, the things I think that I've done that are right, and the mistakes they think I've made.''</p>
        <p>As mayor of New York City, Mr. Giuliani put Mr. Kerik -- a friend and former police detective -- in charge of the city's jail system. Then, in 2000, he named Mr. Kerik police commissioner, the top official in the New York Police Department.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Giuliani left office, he and Mr. Kerik were partners in a security consulting business. And in 2005, he supported President Bush's choice of Mr. Kerik as federal secretary of homeland security, a selection that was withdrawn as questions were raised about Mr. Kerik.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said today, as he has many times before, that ''I made a mistake in recommending Bernie Kerik to the president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik pleaded guilty last year in a New York State court to two misdemeanor charges, admitting that he illegally accepted $165,000 in free renovations of his apartment from a contracting company, Interstate Industrial Corporation, which city regulators suspect of having ties to organized crime.</p>
        <p>The Times reported on Friday that Mr. Giuliani, testifying under oath in April 2006, told a grand jury that the former city commissioner of investigation remembered briefing him on some aspects of Mr. Kerik's relationship to Interstate in 2000, before he named Mr. Kerik as police commissioner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani had previously said publicly that he had not known of those connections until years later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he did not recall any of the briefings remembered by the chief investigator, Edward Kuriansky. He suggested that perhaps he had forgotten them because Mr. Kuriansky had cleared Mr. Kerik to be elevated to the post.</p>
        <p>He said appointment calendars kept by Mr. Kuriansky do not show that he was briefed on Interstate. But partially redacted copies of the calendars, which were provided to The Times by New York City, list one meeting of a kind that Mr. Giuliani typically attended at which a former Interstate employee, who was also a close friend of Mr. Kerik, was listed as a topic for discussion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani also testified last year that his aides who took part in some of the meetings did not recall hearing anything about Mr. Kerik's ties to the company.</p>

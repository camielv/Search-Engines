        <p>POLITICS is not the sort of rough-and-tumble contact sport in which the lion lies down with the lamb. But that is precisely what seems to be afoot in Trenton.</p>
        <p>On April 12, the United States attorney for New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie, is to join the state's attorney general, Stuart Rabner, in an appearance before the Assembly Budget Committee to talk about their joint efforts on homeland security and programs to attack gang violence in the state -- and obtaining federal assistance for both.</p>
        <p>It is highly unusual for a United States attorney who is a Republican appointee to appear in the Democratic-controlled forum. Consider too that Mr. Christie, who was a prolific fund-raiser for President Bush in 2000, has been touted as a possible future United States Senate or gubernatorial candidate.</p>
        <p>This is also a United States attorney with a reputation for excoriating New Jersey's political culture of corruption and indicting politicians. On Thursday, he brought fraud and corruption charges against State Senator Wayne R. Bryant, the powerful Democrat from Camden County.</p>
        <p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that Mr. Christie's name sets off fear among some members of the Democratic-controlled Legislature because of his office's power. Some sense of that fear could be seen in recent weeks as Mr. Christie's office seemed to be casting a wider net as part of its investigation of Mr. Bryant.</p>
        <p>The office subpoenaed records from both the Republican and Democratic legislative leadership, the governor's office and other lawmakers, including Assemblyman Joseph Cryan, the state's Democratic chairman. Mr. Cryan is also a member of the same Assembly Budget Committee before which Mr. Christie is to appear.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats said privately that inviting Mr. Christie to go before the committee was at best inappropriate, and at worst a political mistake.</p>
        <p>''I don't understand it at all,'' said Assemblyman Gary S. Schaer, a Passaic County Democrat and member of the committee. ''This is a budget committee, and I don't understand the role of the U.S. attorney here. I think he would do better appearing before our homeland security committee on these matters.''</p>
        <p>Another lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, was angry.</p>
        <p>''All they are doing is giving him a platform,'' said the lawmaker, a North Jersey Democrat. ''I don't know why they did it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Christie's appearance was brokered by Assemblyman Kevin J. O'Toole, an Essex and Passaic County Republican and member of the budget committee. Mr. O'Toole said he raised the idea with the committee chairman, Assemblyman Louis D. Greenwald, a Camden County Democrat, and Mr. Greenwald said that it was all right with him if it was all right with the committee's main scheduled witness that day, Attorney General Rabner.</p>
        <p>''In the past, you didn't have a working relationship between the U.S. attorney and the state's attorney general,'' Mr. O'Toole said, noting that Mr. Rabner had been one of Mr. Christie's chief assistants before taking on duties in Trenton. ''Mr. Rabner was delighted to do it. Anytime you can have a U.S. attorney here talking about these issues, it is good from a public policy point of view.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 8, 2007, Sunday  The On Politics column last Sunday, about a scheduled appearance before a State Assembly committee by Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey, erroneously included a legislator among those whose offices had received subpoenas from Mr. Christie's office for records. Assemblyman Joseph Cryan's office was not subpoenaed.</p>

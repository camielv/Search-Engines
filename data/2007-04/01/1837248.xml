        <p>IT looks like a Volkswagen Microbus, the sort that starred in last year's film ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' somehow squeezed into a sphere six feet in diameter.</p>
        <p>The ball is the work of the artist Lars-Eric Fisk of Burlington, Vt., who specializes in sphere-shaped sculpture. His work has been shown in museums including the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Mass., outside Boston, and the Dartmouth College museum.</p>
        <p>His work appeared in an exhibition at the DeCordova called ''On the Ball: The Sphere in Contemporary Sculpture.'' He declared in the catalog that the sphere was a ''simple, seamless form expressing movement and the concept of endlessness and timelessness without a beginning, without an ending.''</p>
        <p>''Everyone gets it,'' Mr. Fisk said of his use of the sphere in a recent interview.</p>
        <p>He completed the VW ball in 1999. ''I don't know why, but the VW ball keeps surfacing every few years on the Internet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The VW ball is in a private collection. Mr. Fisk, who was born in Vermont in 1970, has made other balls on automotive themes: a school bus, a green John Deere tractor, a drab brown U.P.S. truck and a white Mister Softee ice cream truck, complete with lights.</p>
        <p>''A U.P.S. guy saw the U.P.S. ball and stopped by the house of the owner,'' Mr. Fisk said. ''He thought it was a package ready for shipping.''</p>
        <p>His spheres come with windows and steering wheels. He does all the work, he said, using metal and glass fabrication skills he taught himself.</p>
        <p>He has also sculptured a street ball, a sphere of asphalt marked with painted dotted lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisk's barn ball, with wood painted red and a window, was used for the cover of the album ''Round Room,'' by the band Phish.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisk said that when people saw his spheres, they came up with their own ideas of other vehicles he could adapt.</p>
        <p>He has recently moved beyond the balls into new modes of sculpture.</p>
        <p>''The new theme for some reason seems to be garbage,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Among his latest pieces, shown at the Taxter &amp; Spengemann Gallery in Manhattan (taxterandspengemann.com), is a sculpture of a garbage can and another one of a garbage bag.</p>

        <p>Editorial praises outgoing Mayor David Kapell for brokering agreement to bring some affordable housing to Greenport, NY</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The village of Greenport has come up with an intriguing model for creating affordable housing, one that seeks to level the village's badly tilted real estate playing field back in favor of regular working people. There is a dwindling number of those in Greenport, whose population of wealthy summer residents has grown significantly in recent years.</p>
        <p>The idea came as part of a settlement of a long-running dispute over two acres of waterfront property that, in the ordinary Long Island scheme of things, would have been destined -- or doomed, depending on your perspective and tax bracket -- to become luxury housing for the village's increasingly Manhattan-based demographic.</p>

        <p>The village of Greenport has come up with an intriguing model for creating affordable housing, one that seeks to level the village's badly tilted real estate playing field back in favor of regular working people. There is a dwindling number of those in Greenport, whose population of wealthy summer residents has grown significantly in recent years.</p>
        <p>The idea came as part of a settlement of a long-running dispute over two acres of waterfront property that, in the ordinary Long Island scheme of things, would have been destined -- or doomed, depending on your perspective and tax bracket -- to become luxury housing for the village's increasingly Manhattan-based demographic.</p>
        <p>The agreement was brokered by Mayor David Kapell, who says he is all for economic growth in his village but hates the thought of housing prices being skewed so high by rich outsiders that they force out people who live and work in Greenport year-round -- those with Main Street, not Wall Street, incomes.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, the property, an old oyster-packing operation, would be redeveloped for both commercial and residential use. There would be one shop repairing and selling yachts, and another freezing and packing scallops. There would be a dozen 1,500-square-foot apartments sold at market -- i.e., luxury -- rates. And then there would be five little one-bedrooms, each 650 square feet, sold for $175,000, only to residents who live or work in Greenport full time. The residency requirement would apply to all future sales and units could not be combined into bigger ones, so -- in theory, anyway -- they would always be too small for the lofty appetites of hedge-fund managers, but just right for young teachers, firefighters or retirees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kapell, who has been in the real estate business for decades, thinks his plan would let the free market do its thing, but tweak it just enough to help the average Greenporter. This sort of idea could and should take hold across Long Island, if only communities could overcome their resistance to higher-density housing and accept the idea of giving a leg up to the dreams of ordinary Long Islanders.</p>
        <p>A postscript: Greenport's tiny experiment in resisting the gentrification juggernaut is further evidence of the political distinctiveness, civil ingenuity and creative enthusiasm of Mayor Kapell, who is leaving office next month after 28 years in public life, 13 as mayor. Mr. Kapell has long been a refreshing oddity in a political landscape where the knee-jerk response to new challenges ranges from ''You can't do that'' to ''Not in my backyard'' to the all-purpose ''No.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kapell is the original ''Yes, in my backyard'' politician. He is committed to preserving Greenport's identity as a working harbor town, not a fake Ye Olde Village smelling of potpourri. He has worked aggressively to welcome new things -- a park, a carousel, an ice rink, a power plant, community patrols in red berets, affordable housing, even Latino immigrants -- and his village, once a dumpy, corrupt East End dead end, has thrived for it.</p>

        <p>As Louisiana State makes its fourth consecutive appearance in the women's Final Four, the interim coach Bob Starkey finds himself in the odd position of being undefeated and perhaps soon unemployed.</p>
        <p>The Lady Tigers (30-7) will face Rutgers in the national semifinals on Sunday, guided by Starkey's assured presence during a tumultuous month since Pokey Chatman resigned as head coach amid charges that she had inappropriate relationships with more than one former player.</p>
        <p>Yet even if L.S.U. wins its first national title on Tuesday, Starkey, 47, is likely to be a head coach with the life span of a mayfly. He has said repeatedly that he has no interest in replacing Chatman full time, and is fond of quoting Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry character in saying, ''A man's got to know his limitations.''</p>
        <p>For 17 years at L.S.U., first as an assistant coach with the men's team and for nine seasons with the women's team, the bespectacled Starkey has been more comfortable in the background, scouting, devising game plans, carrying a clipboard, preferring the invisibility of practice to the spotlight of the postgame news conference.</p>
        <p>He says he would love to stay at L.S.U. as an assistant, but understands that a new coach must be free to choose his or her own staff. What about remaining as head coach? Absolutely no interest, he said. Recruiting is not one of his skills, Starkey freely admits. Nor does he relish the other chores of being in charge -- speaking to reporters, fund-raising and administrative work.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, being a head coach, you don't get to coach a lot,'' Starkey said.</p>
        <p>Such a job would also likely mean more time away from his wife, Sherie Hayslett, who has multiple sclerosis. In an age when million-dollar salaries are paid at top women's programs like Tennessee and Connecticut, and coaches of men's and women's teams can sometimes be preening peacocks, Starkey is content being a bag-lunch bureaucrat.</p>
        <p>''He's one of those guys that doesn't want to draw attention to himself,'' said Don Meyer, one of Starkey's friends and the men's basketball coach at Northern State University in Aberdeen, S.D. ''There's not too many out there anymore.''</p>
        <p>Yet, in the coming days, Starkey has a chance as interim coach to do what Steve Fisher did with the Michigan men's team in 1989: assume control of a skilled, determined team before the N.C.A.A. tournament and win a national championship.</p>
        <p>Sean O'Keefe, L.S.U.'s chancellor, said Starkey had done ''an astonishing job'' with the ability to ''keep your head when others around you can't.''</p>
        <p>Whether he will keep his assistant's job, though, remains uncertain.</p>
        <p>The matter will be addressed after the season, O'Keefe said, adding that ''there are so many permutations and options to consider.''</p>
        <p>Since 1990, Starkey has been hiding in plain sight at L.S.U. as an assistant, helping to cultivate such talent as Shaquille O'Neal and Seimone Augustus, the two-time women's national player of the year. How has the man who has written a book called ''The Art of Being an Assistant Coach'' thrived as interim head coach? By essentially not changing a thing.</p>
        <p>When Starkey took over, he received some straightforward, if not grammatically correct, advice from his coaching friend Meyer: ''Be what you is, because if you be what you ain't, you ain't what you is.''</p>
        <p>While Chatman rode motorcycles and coached with foot-stamping emotion, Starkey was the sober assistant whom she frequently consulted during timeouts before addressing her team and deciding which play to run or defense to call.</p>
        <p>''They've got a lot of kids that have been to the Final Four,'' said Geno Auriemma, the coach at Connecticut, which L.S.U. routed by 73-50 last Monday to reach the Final Four. ''They know how to get there. The coaching staff did a lot of coaching before, so it's not like they're getting bad coaching all of a sudden. I'm not surprised at all.''</p>
        <p>More than anything, players must be reassured about a new coach's basketball knowledge, said C. Vivian Stringer, the coach at Rutgers, L.S.U.'s opponent in the semifinals.</p>
        <p>''It's a good thing he is an X-and-O person because I believe if you're not technically sound, players will soon expose you and they don't have any respect,'' Stringer said of Starkey in a telephone conference call. ''They have to know that you know the game.''</p>
        <p>A native of West Virginia, Starkey possesses a watchmaker's precision and obsession with a team's timing and internal gears. He has continued to refine a defense, anchored by the 6-foot-6 center Sylvia Fowles, that is the nation's most penurious; and to hone a motion offense that is exquisitely balanced between jump hooks from Fowles and 3-point launchings from the perimeter.</p>
        <p>''Coach Starkey has done a great job,'' Fowles said. ''It says a lot about our system.''</p>
        <p>He has also used a couple of motivational tricks. Last Sunday, the day before L.S.U. upset UConn, Starkey cut a net into pieces and handed strands to his players.</p>
        <p>''A loaner,'' he called the pieces, until the players could cut down the nets themselves with a victory over the Huskies.</p>
        <p>According to O'Keefe, L.S.U.'s chancellor, Starkey has also shown the team clips of the movie ''Apollo 13,'' the lunar mission during which looming disaster was averted by the resourcefulness of the space crew and ground technicians, who grew convinced that the crisis could become NASA's ''finest hour.''</p>
        <p>''They've inspired me far more than I've inspired them,'' Starkey said of his players in a typically self-effacing remark.</p>
        <p>He has not spoken to Chatman since she resigned, Starkey said. Asked if he felt betrayed by her, Starkey said, ''Good question, but I don't think I care to comment.''</p>
        <p>He said he supported Carla Berry, the L.S.U. assistant who made the charges of inappropriate behavior against Chatman and who has declined to comment. ''It was courageous,'' Starkey said. ''I think she did the right thing.''</p>
        <p>Beyond Sunday's game against Rutgers, the future of Starkey's career remains unknown. He would ''never say never'' to a head coaching job at another university, Starkey said on a telephone conference call the other day, but he would rather stay put as an assistant coach.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, if Starkey is losing sleep, given his newfound duties as an interim head coach, he said it beat the alternative. ''You could be getting a lot of rest and watching games on TV,'' he said.</p>

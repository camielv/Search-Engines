        <p>Unlike Mexican food or film, Mexican fashion is only beginning to attract the notice of American hipsters. But the nascent trend can already claim its first breakout brand: Mexico City-based NaCo.</p>
        <p>Founded by two college classmates, NaCo the company makes a line of street-chic sportswear inspired by naco the adjective, which translates roughly as tacky, in south-of-the-border slang. (NaCo's ''Ser Naco Es Chido'' tag line means ''to be naco is cool.'')</p>

        <p>Unlike Mexican food or film, Mexican fashion is only beginning to attract the notice of American hipsters. But the nascent trend can already claim its first breakout brand: Mexico City-based NaCo.</p>
        <p>Founded by two college classmates, NaCo the company makes a line of street-chic sportswear inspired by naco the adjective, which translates roughly as tacky, in south-of-the-border slang. (NaCo's ''Ser Naco Es Chido'' tag line means ''to be naco is cool.'')</p>
        <p>Already a favorite of Latin American actors, models and rockers, such as the ''Y Tu Mamá También'' stars Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna (Mr. Luna is an investor), NaCo's Mexico City flagship store is emerging as a sartorial pilgrimage site for the brand's early adopters.</p>
        <p>Situated in the capital's NoLIta-like Condesa district, NaCo Miscelánea was originally to be a small-scale showroom for the line's seasonal collections. But now, Carlos Meza Yazpik, a NaCo partner, says, ''NaCo fans have made it a must-visit to find our newest T-shirts or humorous gifts.''</p>
        <p>The tiny shop's ambience pays homage to Mexico City's ubiquitous corner grocery stores, which New Yorkers know as bodegas. Its walls are festooned with florid, rooster-patterned wallpaper and shelves piled with the latest NaCo T-shirts (200 to 250 pesos, or about $18 to $23 at 11 pesos to the dollar), sweaters (500 pesos) and track jackets (500 pesos). Although NaCo styles are instantly eye-catching, their twists on Mexican pop culture may prove difficult to decode. The Oriental lettering and dragon design of the recent China-loa T-shirt line, for instance, are a cheeky critique of residents from Sinaloa, whose rapid-fire patois turns their town from ''Sina'' into ''China''-loa. Other shirts feature vibrant commentaries on Mexico City's colorful urban culture, from its ubiquitous green Volkswagen beetle taxis to its notoriously thick smog.</p>
        <p>The company has recently begun to sell its products, all made in Mexico, to boutiques in the United States and plans a partnership with the Brazilian sandal-maker Havaiana -- developments that are likely to raise its global profile. But for the moment NaCo Miscelánea is the place to find cult NaCo items like its current collection of wallets, flip-flops and bags. (It is one of five NaCo stores in Mexico, one of two in the city.)</p>
        <p>The shop, Mr. Yazpik said, is ''sort of like a mom-and-pop store for urban pop culture and fashion in Mexico.''</p>
        <p>NaCo Miscelánea, 126-B Yautepec, Condesa; (55-52) 86-13-43; www.chidochido.com or www.usanaco.com.</p>

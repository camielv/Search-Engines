        <p>KOKO TAYLOR, who comes to the B. B. King Blues Club on Friday, has always been a strong woman, the Chicago blues belter who treated the battle of the sexes like an all-out brawl. She has the classic blues pedigree: Born in 1935 near Memphis, she grew up working on a sharecropper's farm before heading for Chicago as a teenager and making her name in the blues. With her gutsy, leathery voice Ms. Taylor turned macho men's songs like ''Wang Dang Doodle'' into her own rough and ready testimonies, and she answered boasts like Muddy Waters's ''Mannish Boy'' with her own ''I'm a Woman,'' vowing, ''I'm an earthshaker.'' No one denied it.</p>
        <p>In 2003 Ms. Taylor had a medical crisis. After emergency surgery for gastrointestinal bleeding, she wound up unable to breathe, on a ventilator in intensive care. For some time it was uncertain whether she would sing again. But she pulled through, and her first new album since 2000, ''Old School'' (Alligator), tears into its blues with a vengeance. The album includes five new songs of her own -- more than she has written for any of her other albums -- and revives hardheaded lesser-known songs from Willie Dixon, Magic Sam, Memphis Minnie and others. ''You don't want to tangle with me,'' Ms. Taylor sings in ''You Ain't Worth a Good Woman.''</p>
        <p>Through the years Ms. Taylor has sometimes simply blustered through songs. On ''Old School'' she's more nuanced and strategic, working her way up before unleashing a rasp. It's a lean, straightforward production -- guitar, piano, bass, drums and an occasional harmonica -- that deliberately looks back to the sound of 1950s and 1960s Chicago blues. Ms. Taylor sounds like she still knows exactly what she wants. Friday, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. 8 p.m.; $33 in advance, $38 Friday.</p>

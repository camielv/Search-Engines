        <p>WHEN buying a vehicle, consumers may need to think about more than price. Depreciation can be just as important.</p>
        <p>Checking depreciation before you get to the showroom does not carry the same hint of mistrust as handing your spouse a prenuptial agreement on your wedding day. After all, you will part with your car someday.</p>

        <p>WHEN buying a vehicle, consumers may need to think about more than price. Depreciation can be just as important.</p>
        <p>Checking depreciation before you get to the showroom does not carry the same hint of mistrust as handing your spouse a prenuptial agreement on your wedding day. After all, you will part with your car someday.</p>
        <p>The average vehicle loses about 65 percent of its original value after five years, according to Kelley Blue Book. So a new car costing $20,000 will be worth about $7,000 after five years.</p>
        <p>But some brands and models retain their value better than others. Every year Kelley Blue Book guides consumers through depreciation with its Best Resale Value Awards.</p>
        <p>The awards are based on the company's Residual Value Guide, which projects the value of vehicles at the end of five years.</p>
        <p>More information is available at www.kbb.com/resaleaward.</p>

        <p>President Bush continued his new courtship of Latin America on home turf on Saturday, meeting and dining with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil at the presidential retreat at Camp David.</p>
        <p>In their second meeting in a month, Mr. Bush and Mr. da Silva talked about the stalled Doha round of trade negotiations and their newly signed deal to cooperate in the development and production of ethanol.</p>
        <p>But the two announced no new breakthroughs.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a joint news briefing, Mr. Bush said he was willing to reduce farm subsidies ''in a substantial way,'' a statement that was likely to get some notice by the farm lobby and its Congressional supporters but was unlikely to convince skeptical European partners.</p>
        <p>But he repeated American demands for fuller access to foreign markets. Developing nations have resisted those demands without greater subsidy and tariff reductions than Mr. Bush is offering.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. da Silva repeated his call for an end to the United States tariff on ethanol produced in Brazil, something Mr. Bush says is Congressionally mandated and out of his control.</p>
        <p>But the visit was clearly intended as another show of allegiance after Mr. Bush's visit to São Paulo three weeks ago, as part of a trip that had the clear intention of fighting the anti-American influence in the region of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, reporters also asked Mr. Bush how long his embattled attorney general, Alberto Gonzales, might have to ''repair the damage'' to his credibility in the controversy over the recent firings of eight United States attorneys.</p>
        <p>''Attorney General Gonzales is an honorable and honest man,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And he has my full confidence.''</p>

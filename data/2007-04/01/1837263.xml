        <p>IT'S not an Achilles' heel, but Paulina Porizkova has duck feet. That is to say, she is a dancing queen without an arch to her name.

Don't be fooled by her Audrey Hepburn style -- she brought klutzyback to television's highly rated ''Dancing With the Stars.''</p>
        <p>But this night was not about dance moves or first novels (her book, ''A Model Summer,'' is out this month), it was about feet. Specifically, being off them and having strangers touch them.</p>

        <p>IT'S not an Achilles' heel, but Paulina Porizkova has duck feet. That is to say, she is a dancing queen without an arch to her name. Otherwise she's every bit as lovely as one might expect of a 41-year-old former supermodel. Don't be fooled by her Audrey Hepburn style -- she brought klutzyback to television's highly rated ''Dancing With the Stars.''</p>
        <p>But this night was not about dance moves or first novels (her book, ''A Model Summer,'' is out this month), it was about feet. Specifically, being off them and having strangers touch them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Porizkova and her friend of a dozen years, Alexandra Wentworth, the on-again-off-again (soon to be on-again) television actress and wife of George Stephanopoulos, were getting pedicures at the Bunya Citi Spa on West Broadway in SoHo. Ms. Porizkova's husband, the rocker and producer Ric Ocasek, had opted out of spa night.</p>
        <p>Seated in leather thrones with massage features, Ms. Wentworth noticed her friend's flat feet and yellowed toenails. But it was Lily Gu, Ms. Porizkova's pedicurist for the evening, who kept asking her client: blister, injury or scar?</p>
        <p>Ms. Gu raised her client's right foot in the air and pointed to it, quizzically.</p>
        <p>''Scar; I had a mole removed,'' Ms. Porizkova said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Porizkova and Ms. Wentworth met on a television pilot and have been close ever since, even with Ms. Wentworth now living in Washington. They wasted not a moment catching up. With these two, there was no story too gross, no moment too humiliating to rehash. Most are unprintable here.</p>
        <p>The semi-sanitized highlight reel? Ms. Wentworth's husband still wants to make love daily, and every year for Christmas he gives his wife a trainer even though she'd rather smoke to be thin. While both women have weathered career peaks and valleys -- Ms. Porizkova at 18 was Sports Illustrated's youngest swimsuit issue cover girl, but she made some forgettable films -- they're now each at a juncture: Ms. Porizkova is in the public eye not as model or actress, but as dancer and novelist, and Ms. Wentworth's new television show, ''Head Case,'' premieres this month on the cable channel Starz.</p>
        <p>Again, Ms. Gu queried with a raised foot.</p>
        <p>''That's a scar, I walked into the refrigerator,'' Ms. Porizkova explained.</p>
        <p>Then she chose the apropos ''Well Red'' for her toes. ''Red is good luck in China,'' Ms. Gu noted.</p>
        <p>''I need all the luck I can get,'' Ms. Porizkova said. ''I didn't realize how bad of a dancer I was.''</p>
        <p>As if on cue, Ms. Wentworth implored the pedicurists to cast votes for Ms. Porizkova. ''But if she falls on her face, don't waste your vote on her,'' Ms. Wentworth cautioned. (She didn't fall on her face, but was the first to be eliminated on Tuesday. She said afterward: ''I guess my fan base was my family and they were not extensive enough.'')</p>
        <p>Their nails dry, they braved inclement weather in search of dinner. They ducked into Balthazar and ordered crab salad appetizers, duck confit and steak frites.</p>
        <p>Polishing off berries and meringue, they discussed the old days. Ms. Porizkova was glad her modeling days were over. ''The size now is 0 to 2,'' she said. ''When I was modeling it was 6. Now, if you're my size, you're hugely overweight. I did a shoot at Vogue recently and I could only fit into one dress.''</p>
        <p>But could she dance in it?</p>

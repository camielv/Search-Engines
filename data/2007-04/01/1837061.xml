        <p>Like the overscaled wallpapers for which she is known, the Australian designer Florence Broadhurst was larger than life. ''Florence Broadhurst: Her Secret and Extraordinary Lives'' (Chronicle, $25) charts the career of a woman born to outback obscurity in 1899. In her 20s, she was a nightclub star. By 1927, Broadhurst had moved to London, where, as Madame Pellier, she ran a Bond Street dress shop. After World War II, she returned to Australia with a 10-year-old son and a man who may or may not have been her legal husband, cultivating the persona of a genteel British lady. In 1960, when a tenant -- a struggling wallpaper manufacturer -- fell behind in rent, she stepped in and began issuing the prints that made her famous, whether or not she actually designed them herself. The final mystery of Broadhurst's life is her brutal, still-unsolved murder, perhaps by one of Australia's most notorious serial killers, in 1977. In 2002 her patterns were resurrected by Signature Prints to great acclaim. Clearly, Broadhurst deserves another moment in the spotlight. Despite somewhat jejune writing, this beautiful book -- covered with one of her patterns and bursting with reproductions of many others -- makes an excellent curtain call.</p>

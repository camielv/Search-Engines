        <p>Democrats easily won two political seats in Nassau County, formerly held by fellow party members, in special elections with light turnout on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Michelle Schimel, of Great Neck, who is the North Hempstead town clerk, won the 16th State Assembly District seat that was vacated by Thomas P. DiNapoli when he became state comptroller. She defeated the Republican candidate, Ryan DeCicco of Port Washington, with 86 percent of the vote. Only 6.8 percent of registered voters turned out.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schimel, 49, had previously hoped to run for Michael A. L. Balboni's State Senate seat when he was appointed head of homeland security for Gov. Eliot Spitzer, but she lost the nomination to County Legislator Craig M. Johnson. He won election to the Senate in February.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson's seat in the 11th District of the County Legislature will be assumed by Wayne H. Wink Jr., of Roslyn, who won 83 percent of the vote against Louis F. Chisari, of New Hyde Park, the Republican candidate. The victory by Mr. Wink, 40, a member of the North Hempstead Town Council, returned a 10 to 9 majority to the Democrats.</p>
        <p>The winners will have to resign from their current positions with the Town of North Hempstead.</p>

        <p>If you have come to think that two words, Gouda and Edam, sum up the total contribution to world cuisine by the Netherlands, Kaas &amp; Company, a South Norwalk mainstay for two decades, is an edifying eye-opener. Even those who know their maatjes from their rookwurst will find that this clean, well-provisioned store goes far beyond its namesake (''kaas'' is the Dutch word for cheese).</p>
        <p>The oversize window of Kaas &amp; Company, which also goes by the name A Taste of Holland, is lined with Dutch and American flags, hand-painted wooden shoes and blue-and-white Delft ceramics, from tiles and teapots to windmills and beer mugs.</p>

Even those who know their maatjes from their rookwurst will find that this clean, well-provisioned store goes far beyond its namesake (''kaas'' is the Dutch word for cheese).</p>
        <p>The oversize window of Kaas &amp; Company, which also goes by the name A Taste of Holland, is lined with Dutch and American flags, hand-painted wooden shoes and blue-and-white Delft ceramics, from tiles and teapots to windmills and beer mugs.</p>
        <p>A wooden rack near the entrance holds more than 40 types of licorice ($5.95 a pound), and an adjacent table is stocked with an assortment of Droste chocolates ($9.75 for a seven-ounce box).</p>
        <p>More than two dozen types of cookies are stacked nearby, as well as a handful of spiced cakes, including a moist Friese gemberkoek, or ginger cake ($3.50, approximately 17.5 ounces).</p>
        <p>Kaas &amp; Company, owned by Justin Schenkels, an expatriate of the Netherlands, carries just about everything necessary to prepare a truly Dutch dinner -- or breakfast or lunch, for that matter -- right down to jarred vegetables and various jams, smoked mackerel ($12 a pound) and maatjes, or brine-cured herring ($6 a pair), all imported from the Lowlands. If your taste tends more toward Indonesian rijsttafel, there is an enticing array of Indonesian spices, sambals and sauces too. And, sure, you will also find a selection of cheeses, including a tangy goat milk cheese ($7.95 a pound) as well as an array of variously aged Gouda and Edam.</p>
        <p>Kaas &amp; Company, 83 Washington Street, South Norwalk; (203) 838-6161 or www.kaasnco.com. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Saturday; closed Sunday.</p>

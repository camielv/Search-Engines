        <p>KREIPKE--Sven A. Former President of Lummus, Sven A. Kreipke, 80, of Boca Raton, FL and Franklin Lakes, NJ passed away on March 30, 2007. Sven was the much beloved husband of Jytte, father of Per, Anette and Niels, father-in-law of Adrienne, Srdjan and Cheryl, and proud grandfather of six. Born in Taarbaek, Denmark, Sven came to the US in 1951 with an M.S. from the Technical University of Denmark as a plant engineer for E.I. du Pont, where he worked until joining Lummus in Newark, NJ, in 1957. While assigned to Lummus Spain, Sven met and married Jytte Engel-Andreasen. Sven held several senior management positions with Lummus in Europe and the US, and was appointed President of The Lummus Company in 1980, and eventually CEO of The Lummus Group. After his retirement in 1985, Sven continued his association with Lummus and its parent, ABB, as a Board member of ABB Lummus Global until 2003. Sven was notable for his honor and integrity: a man of convictions and great strength of character, he was a gentleman in all that he did, whether business or personal. His relationships with family, friends and colleagues were treasured by all who knew him, and he will be sorely missed. In celebration of Sven's life, a visitation and service will be held at Babione Funeral Home in Boca Raton on April 2nd from 3 to 6 (services at 5pm). In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to United Cerebral Palsy (www.UCP.org).</p>

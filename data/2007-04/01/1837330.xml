        <p>The narrator of the news segment on immigration intones, in the purest Lou Dobbsian tones, that the report will look ''at the human cost of Mexicans.''</p>
        <p>The subject of the profile is one Raymond Boyle, a former senior vice president of Lucent Technologies who lost his $840,000-a-year job to a Mexican migrant worker, Alberto Fuentes, who was willing to work for a mere $600,000. Mr. Boyle, who has had to retrench, says, ''Unless you've been through it, you have no idea what it is like to live year-round in your second home.''</p>

        <p>The narrator of the news segment on immigration intones, in the purest Lou Dobbsian tones, that the report will look ''at the human cost of Mexicans.''</p>
        <p>The subject of the profile is one Raymond Boyle, a former senior vice president of Lucent Technologies who lost his $840,000-a-year job to a Mexican migrant worker, Alberto Fuentes, who was willing to work for a mere $600,000. Mr. Boyle, who has had to retrench, says, ''Unless you've been through it, you have no idea what it is like to live year-round in your second home.''</p>
        <p>The video, a put-on of CNN's breathless reports on immigration, was The Onion's first effort at producing fake TV news to complement the fake print and online stories that made it famous.</p>
        <p>In the video, Mr. Fuentes has turned around the company. But in reality, Lucent is no more. Since last year, it has been part of Alcatel-Lucent, based in Paris.</p>
        <p>Alcatel-Lucent, for its part, said it was not annoyed by the video. ''It's clearly a spoof,'' said Mary Ward, a company spokeswoman. ''We take it for what it is.''</p>

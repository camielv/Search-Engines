        <p>In mid-March, tiny, perfectly round holes were found in tree bark on Pralls Island in the Arthur Kill, the waterway that separates Staten Island and New Jersey. Similar holes were found in trees in Maspeth, Queens, in February, and just last week, a lone silver maple on Staten Island was discovered with the same markings. They are ominous signs to those who recognize them.</p>
        <p>The holes are the work of the Asian longhorned beetle, a 1.5-inch-long, pitch-black insect with long, striped antennas and an inexhaustible appetite for wood that poses a dire threat to woods in the city and beyond.</p>
        <p>''The emergence of this newest infestation in Staten Island and Queens shows us that we're a long way from winning this particular fight,'' said Adrian Benepe, the city parks commissioner. But his department is coming out swinging. Last week, city workers began chopping down 3,000 trees on Pralls Island -- fully half the total growth there.</p>
        <p>Moreover, city inspectors in helmets and safety harnesses are fanning out through much of the city to inspect the upper branches of trees, where infestations typically begin. Tree trunks and soil will be injected with insecticides through devices with names like the Arborjet and the Davey Beetle Buster. Time is short; the beetles will begin boring out of the trees in late spring.</p>
        <p>The Chinese call the insect the starry night beetle. Its back is covered in small white smudges, which look almost as if they were applied with a paintbrush, and its arms and legs have a bluish tint. ''It's a very pretty insect,'' said Christine Markham, who oversees efforts to eradicate the bug for the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>But the beetles are so destructive that when they were first found in more than 500 trees in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in 1996, a nationwide scare erupted. That outbreak, started by bugs believed to have arrived in a shipment of wood from China, was contained. But several others have appeared in the city and in New Jersey and Illinois over the past decade; the Pralls Island infestation, Ms. Markham said, appears to date from before a 1998 ban on importing Chinese wooden packing materials.</p>
        <p>Besides the tininess of the bugs and the large area to check, the hunt for the longhorned beetle is hampered by the small number of inspectors available, Mr. Benepe said. Once found, the beetles are fairly easy to stop, but there may be multiple infestations in the city that have not been found.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benepe urges the public to be on the lookout for the beetles' distinctive holes and is requesting an additional $48 million in federal money for inspections and eradication. The biggest fear is that the insects, found so far only in the four boroughs that are on islands, will reach the Bronx and then have a clear path up through New England.</p>
        <p>''We can win this fight,'' Mr. Benepe said. ''The specter of losing the fight is a very scary one.''</p>

        <p>When RAINER WERNER FASSBINDER died of a drug overdose in 1982, he had just turned 37 -- which still seems astonishing a quarter-century later. Part of the shock is the thought of what he might have gone on to accomplish as he matured alongside his baby-boomer colleagues in West Germany and beyond. His generational cohort included Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese as well as Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders; if any of their careers had ended when Fassbinder's did, the loss to cinema would have been grievous indeed.</p>
        <p>Even more stunning, though, is just how much he accomplished in so short a time. When it came to writing and directing, he was prolific, even compulsive, as if he knew his time was short. And perhaps for this reason his work has an urgency that has hardly diminished over time. His exhumations of German history -- a politically charged project in the 1960s and '70s -- have a ferocity rarely seen in costume drama, and his inquiries into sex and power are capable of delivering a jolt of discomfort even to jaded eyes that think they've seen it all before.</p>
        <p>An excellent and eclectic sampling of his films will be presented at the Museum of Modern Art starting Monday. Among the highlights are ''Lili Marleen'' and ''Veronika Voss,'' but the program, called ''Fassbinder in the Collection,'' represents the full range of his films. It also offers audiences a chance to rediscover the enigmatic, occasionally frightening charms of Hanna Schygulla, the great German actress who was Fassbinder's muse, alter ego and fetish object.

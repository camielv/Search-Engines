        <p>Ten players who are setting the standard at their positions.</p>
        <p>LF MANNY RAMÍREZ  Red Sox  With 470 home runs, he is one of four players with a chance at his 500th homer this season. It would be the first time that more than two players reached the milestone in the same season.</p>
        <p>CF ANDRUW JONES  Braves  Has won nine straight Gold Glove awards. Ranks fifth among outfielders behind co-leaders Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays (12) and Ken Griffey Jr. and Al Kaline (10).</p>
        <p>RF, CF ICHIRO SUZUKI  Mariners  Will try for his seventh consecutive 200-hit season, which would tie him with Wade Boggs and put him one season from tying Willie Keeler, who holds the record.</p>
        <p>3B ALEX RODRIGUEZ  Yankees  Tied with Jimmie Foxx as the only players to compile at least 35 home runs, 100 runs and 100 runs batted in in nine consecutive seasons (1998-2006).</p>
        <p>SS JOSÉ REYES  Mets  Needs 44 stolen bases to reach 200 for his career. Is only the second shortstop since 1974 with at least 60 stolen bases in a season. Had 64 steals last season and 60 in 2005.</p>
        <p>2B CHASE UTLEY  Phillies  Led all second basemen last season in runs (128), hits (198), homers (31) and runs batted in (100).</p>
        <p>1B ALBERT PUJOLS  Cardinals  Has six consecutive seasons with at least a .300 average, 30 home runs and 100 runs batted in.</p>
        <p>DH JIM THOME  White Sox  Will try for his 10th season with 100 or more runs batted in. Only four other active players have knocked in that many in 10 or more seasons.</p>
        <p>C IVÁN RODRÍGUEZ  Tigers  Is 146 hits away from 2,500. Of his 2,354 hits, 2,266 have come as a catcher. Is the only catcher since 1974 with at least 2,000 hits.</p>
        <p>P JOHAN SANTANA  Twins  Has won his last 16 decisions at home and has a 1.93 E.R.A. during the streak. Ray Kremer holds the record with 22 consecutive home victories from 1926-27.</p>

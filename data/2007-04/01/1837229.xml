        <p>ONE of the rarest Buick Supers is the 1940 wood-body station wagon that is said to have once been owned by Bette Davis.</p>
        <p>As the story goes, the car was originally part of the Warner Brothers fleet, which the studio used in its movies, and it had a cameo role in ''Now, Voyager,'' the 1942 film that starred Davis and Paul Henreid. At some point after that, the studio apparently gave her the car.</p>
        <p>''We have documentation that shows it in the movies,'' said Martyn L. Schorr, a spokesman for the car's owner, ''but as far as details of when they gave it away, my guess is that you can't tell.''</p>
        <p>The car was restored some years ago, when it was repainted in its original maroon and its red leather interior was refurbished. Nicola Bulgari, the vice chairman of his family's worldwide chain of jewelry stores, bought it in 2001.</p>
        <p>It can be seen on Friday, Saturday and next Sunday at the New York International Automobile Show at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, where it will be part of the display of 16 notable cars sponsored by the Harold E. LeMay Museum in Tacoma, Wash.</p>
        <p>Buick built only 495 Super wagons in 1940, the first year of its production. Buick called them Estate Wagons, and it turned to the Biehl Body Company in Reading, Pa., to supply the wood bodies.</p>
        <p>In their book, ''The Buick: A Complete History'' (Automobile Quarterly, 2002), Terry B. Dunham and Lawrence R. Gustin tell how the Buick wagon came to be. The push for it came from an unusual source: Bunny McLeod, the wife of Norman Z. McLeod, who directed ''Monkey Business'' and ''Horse Feathers'' with the Marx Brothers.</p>
        <p>In 1938, she told visiting Buick brass that the family didn't own a Buick because there wasn't a station wagon in the entire line and she needed one. Buick took the hint. Like other Supers, the Estate Wagons were powered by a 248-cubic-inch straight 8s and a three-speed manual transmission. Like other wagons of the day, the wood was structural, not decorative, making the cars prone to squeaks, rattles and rot.</p>
        <p>But Estate Wagons, with their varnished white ash and mahogany, projected a countrified elegance from Newport to Newport Beach.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Not all gay men who move to Hell's Kitchen are young and living in tiny tenement walk-ups. ''Under the Rainbow'' (March 25) neglects to mention luxury buildings like Worldwide Plaza, with apartments (and prices) to rival any in Chelsea. The fact is, several gay men don't ''settle'' for Hell's Kitchen. They choose to live here.</p>
        <p>I sold my apartment on West 64th Street off Central Park West three years ago for a tidy profit. I could have easily moved to Chelsea. What attracted me to Hell's Kitchen was the amenities -- its Midtown location, its many restaurants and food shops (Ninth Avenue has long been known as the most diverse food strip in the world, celebrated by the annual Ninth Avenue International Food Festival) and its housing stock (47th between 9th and 10th rivals any Chelsea brownstone block).</p>
        <p>But mainly it wasn't Chelsea. Even while gentrification is rapidly changing its ethnic and socioeconomic makeup, the gay men flocking to Hell's Kitchen reject the bland, commodified gay culture that has overtaken Chelsea and the homogenized ''Chelsea boy'' clone.</p>
        <p>By the way, I have heard of far more cases of anti-gay harassment in Chelsea than in Hell's Kitchen.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It's fine if the organizers of PrideFest, the street fair following the annual gay pride parade, want to move it from the West Village to Chelsea (''A Street Fair That Outgrew Its Street,'' March 11). But they shouldn't pretend that it's because Chelsea has become more representative of the gay community.</p>
        <p>The West Village has as many gay bars as Chelsea, and they cater specifically to blacks, women and older people. And the piers at the end of Christopher Street are a magnet for gay and transgendered youth. Can Chelsea claim such diversity?</p>
        <p>Moving the street fair to Chelsea may attract more of the mostly white, mostly affluent gay men who live there. But the crowds probably won't be as accurate a snapshot of the whole gay community.</p>

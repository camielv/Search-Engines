        <p>PEAKE--Ann Journeay, beloved wife of the late David Wainwright Peake, mother of three children and a doting grandmother to seven grandchildren, died March 13, 2007. She was 81 years old and resided in Houston and Hunt, Texas. Born March 28, 1925 in Liverpool, England, she was the daughter of Hildegarde Storey and George Baldwin Journeay. Her father was an independent cotton broker, then based in Liverpool. She graduated from Chatham Hall in 1943 and Smith College in 1947. She married David Peake in 1948 and moved to Houston in 1950. She was a ''Proud Texan,'' in her words, with distinguished Texas ancestors dating back to the earliest days of the Republic. She counted among her ancestors a Texas Ranger, Civil War military leaders, judges, a lieutenant governor of Texas, a chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission, and perhaps the best-known, her paternal great-grandfather, Henry Journeay, a survivor of the ill-fated Mier Expedition that in 1842 went to Mexico in retaliation for the Mexican raid on San Antonio. The Texans were defeated by Santa Anna and subjected them to a unique and brutal retribution commemorated in a Frederic Remington painting. A jar was filled with beans, every tenth bean being black, while the others were white. The ones who drew a black bean were immediately shot. Henry dug deep, pulled out a white bean and was spared. She is survived by her daughter Robin Peake Stuart and husband, Sandy of Lake Forest, Illinois, her son David Wainwright Peake, Jr. and wife, Katherine of Fredericksburg, Texas, her daughter Susan Storey Peake of Sea Island, Georgia and seven grandchildren, who were her true joy. Her love of family and friends and her wonderful sense of humor will be sorely missed by all. If desired, please make contributions to Chatham Hall, Chatham, Virginia, 24531.</p>

        <p>At 13, Charles Simonyi won a Junior Astronaut competition in Hungary that earned him a trip to Moscow to meet one of the first cosmonauts. This week, on Saturday, the former Microsoft engineer who oversaw the creation of the ''Word'' and ''Excel'' software programs is scheduled to depart on a roughly 12-day orbital flight to the International Space Station on a Soyuz TMA spacecraft, along with two cosmonauts. Having paid about $25 million to Space Adventures, a privately owned space tourism company, Mr. Simonyi will become the fifth civilian space tourist to pay for the out-of-this-world experience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simonyi will not only orbit the earth at approximately 17,500 kilometers per hour, he will also assist in space station research and share a six-course meal -- prepared by the French chef Alain Ducasse from a menu chosen by Martha Stewart -- with the crew. Mr. Simonyi's Web site and blog (www.charlesinspace.com) is already loaded with images (including a hilarious video of him doing weightless exercises in the zero G simulator), and has a ''Kid's Space,'' with a link where children can pose questions about space travel.</p>

        <p>Space Adventures (www.spaceadventures.com) also offers zero gravity and centrifuge training at more down-to-earth prices -- $3,500 and $7,795 respectively. Or for a mere $100 million per seat you can become part of the first private expedition to the moon. Like its destination, though, it is still a long way off.</p>

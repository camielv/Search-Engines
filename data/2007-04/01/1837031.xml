        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a teacher of English, a part-time poet and a full-time wordie, I took genuine delight in Patricia T. O'Conner's review of books about language by Ben Yagoda and David Crystal (March 11).</p>
        <p>I was also struck by the illustration that accompanied the review -- the diagram with the red-penciled correction of the misplaced objects of a preposition. While I continue to make up my mind about allegiance to the prescriptivists or descriptivists, I remain certain that much of today's bad writing and speaking might be prevented if, early on, language learners absorbed the architecture of English sentences by formulating those glorious spatial constructs -- sentence diagrams.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In her review of two books on language use, Patricia T. O'Conner dismisses one author's belief that the battle of the prescriptivists against descriptivists is a class war: ''The worst crimes against English are committed not by the underprivileged but by bureaucrats in academia, government and business.''</p>
        <p>Of course it's about class. Professionals might be abusers of the standard language, but they get away with it, achieving and maintaining their professional status. Those not already credentialed are taken to intelligence-task for using double negatives (''He didn't do nothing''). The political speech writer or academic can use a double negative (''It is not without regret that I fire you'') and be perceived as good with words.</p>

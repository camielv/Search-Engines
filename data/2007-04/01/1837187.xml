        <p>Today, Mr. Krause, 41, is free to start every day with a piece of dark-chocolate-covered nut and caramel. And as the third-generation owner of Krause's Chocolates in Saugerties, that is exactly what he does.</p>

        <p>Karl Krause remembers his first chocolate -- a coconut-filled piece of chocolate, to be precise -- as a clandestine thrill he discovered at age 5 in his family's hallway closet.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Krause, 41, is free to start every day with a piece of dark-chocolate-covered nut and caramel. And as the third-generation owner of Krause's Chocolates in Saugerties, that is exactly what he does.</p>
        <p>Chocolate aficionados have reason to be envious.</p>
        <p>Krause's chocolates are handmade daily with fresh ingredients (many of them are also organic), so they always have a just-made, deliciously fragrant taste.</p>
        <p>The myriad centers, from creams to butter crunch to peanut brittle, are cooked in a big copper pot, then individually hand dipped with special implements so that each chocolate looks slightly different from the next. There are 45 varieties ($9.95 a pound for most; $17.90 a pound for hand-rolled truffles). An extra-dark version, recently added, has a high cocoa content that makes for a stronger, pleasantly bitter taste.</p>
        <p>The Krause family recipes have been around for nearly 80 years. Mr. Krause's grandfather, Alfred Krause, apprenticed as a candy maker in Germany before immigrating to the United States and eventually opening a shop in Forest Hills, Queens. His son, Manfred, opened the Saugerties store in 1972, and Karl Krause took over in 2001.</p>
        <p>Krause's is a sunny, lively, well laid-out place just off Esopus Creek that always offers some kind of seasonal treat. Chocolate-covered strawberries were available for Valentine's Day, and chocolate bunnies currently abound.</p>
        <p>If you can't make it to Saugerties, orders can be made online. Internet-based purchases, first offered about two years ago, now make up 10 percent of sales.</p>
        <p>Krause's Chocolates, 41 South Partition Street, Saugerties; (845) 246-8377 or krauseschocolates.com.</p>

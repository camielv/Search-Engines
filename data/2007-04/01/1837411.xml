        <p>An article last Sunday about the motives behind community service misstated the sentence that the actor Russell Crowe received for throwing a telephone at a hotel desk clerk. He pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and was released on the condition that he avoid an arrest during the next year. He was not required to perform community service. The article also referred imprecisely to the recent discovery of rat infestation in a Greenwich Village restaurant. The restaurant was a KFC/Taco Bell, not a Taco Bell. (The reference was to a ''Taco Bell-loving rat.'')</p>

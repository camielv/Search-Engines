        <p>All dance is influenced to some extent by the artists who perform it. That makes for difficulties in restaging pieces with different dancers, and even calls authorship into question occasionally. (Did George Balanchine really create the unnerving solo that ends his ''Episodes,'' or did Paul Taylor, the man who danced it?) JOHN JASPERSE, a modern-dance choreographer with a gift for poetic insights and visual effects, cuts to the chase in a new piece, ''BECKY, JODI AND JOHN,'' which opens Wednesday at Dance Theater Workshop. It celebrates Becky Hilton, Jodi Melnick and Mr. Jasperse. The three, who will perform the piece, met nearly two decades ago and have remained friends. Mr. Jasperse explores the constancy of their personalities, and the role of dancing, in making their friendship possible. 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $25.</p>
        <p>NORA CHIPAUMIRE is a relatively new modern-dance choreographer. Whatever else her new ''DARK SWAN'' may be, it will be performed by the powerful Ms. Chipaumire on Thursday at the BRICstudio in Brooklyn. Sadly, its theme is more pertinent than ever today. Born in wartime Zimbabwe, Ms. Chipaumire traces the journey of a woman as she loses her country, her family and even her bearings, in a solo inspired by the ballet classic ''The Dying Swan'' and set to its score, by Saint-Saëns. The performance is part of 651 Arts's ''Choreography in Development'' series. 57 Rockwell Place, next to the BAM Harvey Theater, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4181, 651arts.org; $5.</p>
        <p>And for bittersweet laughter, there is LARRY KEIGWIN at Symphony Space. Mr. Keigwin and his company will explore the ways gender can be ''bent, stretched, inverted, converted and manipulated'' to enhance self-scrutiny, with humor. Thursday through Saturday, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, larrykeigwin.com; $21, $25 on the day of the show.</p>

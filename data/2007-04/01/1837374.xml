        <p>Boris A. Berezovsky, a self-exiled Russian tycoon and virulent foe of the Kremlin, said Saturday that he was interviewed Friday at Scotland Yard by a Russian investigator in the inquiry into the poisoning of the former K.G.B. officer Alexander V. Litvinenko.</p>
        <p>The investigator also interviewed Akhmed Zakayev, an exiled Chechen leader and close associate of Mr. Litvinenko, Mr. Berezovsky said.</p>
        <p>These are the first interviews in the case that Russian investigators are known to have made on British soil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Litvinenko, a Berezovsky aide and employee of long standing, died in a London hospital on Nov. 23, poisoned by a radioactive isotope, polonium-210.</p>
        <p>The poisoning left a trail of contamination across London, Hamburg and Moscow in locations that included Mr. Berezovsky's office.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview on Saturday, Mr. Berezovsky also said that he would announce the creation of a Litvinenko Justice Foundation on Tuesday, to be aimed at aiding investigations into Mr. Litvinenko's death, preventing ''in the future the same terror attack'' and helping compensate those who suffered psychological, physical or material harm in the case.</p>
        <p>Britain's Health Protection Agency found traces of contamination in several hotels, restaurants and offices in London, including the Pine Bar of the Millennium hotel in Grosvenor Square, just across the way from the American Embassy, where Mr. Litvinenko is thought to have ingested the polonium.</p>
        <p>The agency has found that of almost 4,000 people who registered concern about contamination by the isotope, 716 people had shown low levels of contamination that did not constitute a health risk, the Health Protection Agency said earlier this month. A further 17 people -- including Mr. Litvinenko's widow, Marina, and seven members of the Pine Bar staff -- showed contamination ''not significant enough to cause any illness in the short term and any increased risk in the long term is likely to be very small.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berezovsky, a billionaire who made his fortune in Russia's freewheeling 1990s before fleeing the country in 2000, declined to say how much he would give the foundation in financial support. He is wanted on fraud charges in Russia, and the Kremlin has sought to secure his return to Moscow since he was granted asylum here in 2003.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Litvinenko's death, the British police and the Russian prosecutor general have opened inquiries. Scotland Yard detectives went to Moscow to interview Russians linked to the case last December.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berezovsky said was quizzed for three and a half hours in Russian by the investigator from the Russian prosecutor general's office, whom he identified as Alexander Otvodov.</p>
        <p>Two British detectives and an interpreter were also present, he said. Before the interview, Mr. Berezovsky said, he had set three conditions -- that the interview should not take place at the Russian Embassy, that the Russian investigator should be searched in advance for weapons or poison, and that it should be recorded.</p>
        <p>Although the inquiry was supposedly into the Litvinenko case, Mr. Berezovsky said, ''He asked me just about my accounts, my family's accounts, the accounts of Mr. Litvinenko, about what I know about who will be the beneficiary of the assets of Litvinenko. I told him: 'You are just tax police. You are not interested in what I think about Litvinenko.' ''</p>
        <p>He said that Mr. Zakayev was interviewed separately.</p>

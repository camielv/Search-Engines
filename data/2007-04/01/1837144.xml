        <p>Saul Perlmutter letter on Richard Panek's March 11 article on dark energy says he and other scientists working on Supernova Cosmology Project did not alone invent idea of measuring expansion of universe using supernovas as distance indicators</p>

        <p>As one of the scientists featured in Richard Panek's article (March 11), I want to emphasize that our Supernova Cosmology Project team did not invent the idea alone of measuring the expansion of the universe using supernovae as distance indicators. This was a large community effort, beyond even the work of the two main rival teams (the other being the High-Z Supernova Search, led by Brian Schmidt). In fact, several generations of scientists and dedicated projects previously studied and classified the supernovae and honed them in their role as ''standard candles'' (the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey deserves particular mention).</p>

        <p>ALBANY, April 17 Â— Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver directed $7.3 million in grants to community organizations for the current fiscal year, according to an analysis of documents released by his office on Tuesday.</p>

        <p>Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver directed $7.3 million in grants to community organizations for the current fiscal year, according to an analysis of documents released by his office on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Such grants, known as member items, have in the past been negotiated outside of the normal budget process and widely criticized by government watchdog groups as a form of secretive pork-barrel spending. Thanks to an agreement between the Legislature and Gov. Eliot Spitzer earlier this year to delineate the grants and their sponsors in the state budget, member items are now a more visible form of Albany pork, though by no means the only form.</p>
        <p>But notwithstanding their newfound visibility, the dollar total of Mr. Silver's member items this year is nearly the same as it was last year, when he handed out $7.2 million in grants. Mr. Silver's counterpart in the Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader, distributed about $3 million of member item grants for the current fiscal year. Two years ago, Mr. Bruno distributed $5.7 million in grants.</p>
        <p>About 100 organizations received grants this year that were either solely or jointly sponsored by Mr. Silver. Most of the recipients were schools or social service providers active in Mr. Silver's Lower Manhattan district, including a number of Jewish or Chinese organizations that represent crucial political constituencies there.</p>
        <p>''I think that a lot of what he sponsored are things that are picked up and supported by a lot of members of our conference,'' said Charles Carrier, a spokesman for Mr. Silver. ''These are programs that have a long history and are recognized throughout the city. As usual, he will do things that reflect the sentiment of a large portion of the conference.''</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn-based Ohel Children's Home and Family Services and its sister organizations, a group of Jewish charities, received nearly $1 million, nearly all of it through items sponsored by Mr. Silver alone. The Chinese-American Planning Council received grants totaling $474,000, and the United Jewish Council of the East Side received $669,500.</p>
        <p>The Assembly has allocated roughly $45 million in member items so far, out of a total of $85 million set aside for the purpose in this year's budget. Any grants coming out of the remaining $40 million would be specified in supplemental budget legislation, Mr. Carrier said.</p>
        <p>In recent years, when Gov. George E. Pataki was in office, a large proportion of the Assembly's member items went to restore cuts Mr. Pataki had made to state programs.</p>

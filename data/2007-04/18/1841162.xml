        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Stalking Strangers' DNA'' (''The DNA Age'' series, front page, April 2) states that the law views DNA from discarded cigarettes, drinking cups and so on to be abandoned property.</p>
        <p>In fact, the courts have not reached a clear decision on whether people have an expectation of privacy over their DNA, which they are continuously but not intentionally shedding.</p>
        <p>How many of us would care whether anyone, without our consent, could violate our privacy by probing into our genome? And if that probing without a court warrant is legal, what is the value of all the genetic privacy laws and laws against genetic discrimination that have been enacted by many states, while a federal bill is pending in Congress?</p>

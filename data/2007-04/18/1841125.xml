        <p>A group of Japanese researchers on Tuesday publicly challenged Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's denials that Japan's military coerced women into sexual slavery during World War II, citing reports compiled by Allied investigators immediately after the war.</p>
        <p>The reports, based partly on interrogations of Japanese prisoners, were originally submitted to the Tokyo war crimes trials, which ended in 1948, as evidence of atrocities by Japan during its wartime expansion across Asia. The reports include accounts of Japanese soldiers and sailors rounding up foreign women for use as sex slaves, euphemistically known here as comfort women.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abe and other conservatives have repeatedly said there was no evidence that Japan's military had a direct hand in forcing women into sexual slavery. Many Japanese conservatives have cited the lack of corroborating official documents to dismiss the testimony of former sex slaves, who started coming forward in the 1990s to tell their stories.</p>
        <p>While the evidence presented Tuesday was not new, the group's members said they felt obliged to respond to Mr. Abe's denials. The group's public rebuttal of Mr. Abe was a rare protest in a country where the prime minister's remarks had stirred little outcry. The reaction has been much stronger in the rest of Asia, where memories of Japanese aggression remain raw, highlighting Tokyo's isolation on war history.</p>
        <p>''It is clear that the comfort women system was a system of sexual slavery,'' said a group member, Hirofumi Hayashi, a history professor at Kanto Gakuin University. ''However, the movement to openly deny this has grown stronger in the government and elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>Receptionists answering the telephone at Mr. Abe's office said that no one was available to comment.</p>
        <p>Facing a wave of criticism abroad, including from members of the United States Congress, Mr. Abe has appeared to backtrack slightly, saying he will adhere to a 1993 government statement that acknowledged the state's role in managing war ''comfort stations.'' But he has refused to acknowledge that the military forcibly recruited women. In the past, he said that such recruitment had been done by private brokers.</p>
        <p>The documents presented Tuesday, compiled by Dutch investigators after the war, included descriptions of Japanese soldiers and naval policemen rounding up women in Indonesia to use in military brothels. In one case, Japanese detained, beat and then stripped Indonesian women to coerce them into working in military brothels, the documents said.</p>
        <p>The researchers said the fact that the documents had been used in the Tokyo war tribunal would make it harder for the Japanese government to deny them. The Japanese government formally accepted the tribunal's rulings as part of the 1951 peace treaty that it signed with Allied powers, including the United States.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it can start denying the ruling now,'' said another group member, Yoshiaki Yoshimi, a professor of history at Chuo University.</p>
        <p>However, Japanese political analysts said the documents would not sway conservatives, who had stepped up efforts to deny the war tribunal's conclusions, calling them victors' justice. Scholars elsewhere in Asia welcomed the researchers' presentation of evidence, particularly the report by Dutch investigators.</p>
        <p>''This is a significant find,'' said Chung Chin Sung, a professor of sociology at Seoul National University, who has specialized in the sexual slavery issue. The evidence includes ''the only official document I have seen that states specifically that Japanese troops forcibly recruited women for sexual slavery,'' he said. ''This will help debunk Abe's position.''</p>

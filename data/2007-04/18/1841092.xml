        <p>10 P.M. (AMC) HUSTLE -- California, here they come. Albert, the veteran grifter played by Robert Vaughn, above far right, and his London crew (played by, from left, Robert Glenister, Jaime Murray, Marc Warren and the newcomer Ashley Walters, not shown) cross the pond to begin a new season of scamming in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Tonight the con artists try to convince a movie memorabilia fanatic (Robert Wagner, in a guest role) that the Hollywood sign is coming up for sale. Yeah, right.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (NBC) THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE -- George Takei, Chelsea Handler, Tom Green and Shannon Elizabeth enter the improv fray in the latest episode of this comedy competition. Each week four actors walk into a live sketch to the words ''Thank God you're here!'' and pray that they can pick things up from there. Dave Foley is judge; David Alan Grier is host.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- On tonight's results show, the country singer Martina McBride, right, performs ''Anyway,'' from her latest album, ''Waking Up Laughing,'' while one contestant leaves the competition behind with an achy, breaky heart.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13, 49) EUROPE'S 9/11 -- ''America at a Crossroads,'' the weeklong series of documentaries that examine the challenges confronting the world in the aftermath of Sept. 11, investigates the phenomenon of homegrown terrorism through a look at the 2004 bombings in Madrid and their connection to Qaeda activities in Milan; the murder that year of the filmmaker Theo Van Gogh in the Netherlands; and the difficulties governments face in identifying potential terrorists among radical Islamists. At 10 ''The Muslim Americans'' looks at life, including assimilation and discrimination, for Muslims in the United States after 9/11, as compared with their counterparts in Britain and Europe, and the diversity among those who practice Islam in this country.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (ABC) LOST -- Desmond coaxes Charlie, Hurley and Jin on a trek across the jungle that puts Charlie's life in danger, and Kate turns to Sawyer after seeing Jack alone with Juliet.</p>
        <p>11:15 P.M. (Starz) MARTIN LAWRENCE PRESENTS: FIRST AMENDMENT STAND-UP -- Mr. Lawrence, as executive producer, inches into P. Diddy and HBO territory with this new weekly comedy series presenting some pretty outspoken young comedians, starting tonight with Donnell Rawlings, Ian Edwards and Sheryl Underwood. Doug Williams is host; D.J. Biz Markie keeps things pumping.</p>

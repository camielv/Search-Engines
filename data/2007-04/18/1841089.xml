        <p>IN TRANSITION</p>
        <p>Jean-Georges Vongerichten and his partners have closed their Chinese effort, 66, and in late spring will turn it into MATSU GEN, a Japanese restaurant specializing in soba noodles. It is a joint venture with the three Matsushita brothers, who own restaurants in Tokyo. The 66 design, by Richard Meier, will be tweaked by Thomas Juul-Hansen, who designed Mr. Vongerichten's Perry St.: 241 Church Street, (212) 925-0202.</p>
        <p>OPENING THIS WEEK</p>
        <p>INSIEME -- The name is Italian for together. It certainly applies to the menu of this understatedly elegant restaurant, with beige leather banquettes, which opened on Monday in the Michelangelo Hotel in Midtown. One side, in Italian, lists classics like fritto misto, lasagne bolognese and arista, the Tuscan pork roast. Opposite are modern interpretations like lamb carpaccio and saltimbocca of wild bass. But perhaps the chef, Marco Canora, above left, and his partner, Paul Grieco, right, a wine expert (both of Hearth in the East Village), were looking for an easy way to a house wine: at least three producers, in Italy and California, make blends labeled Insieme: 777 Seventh Avenue ( 51st Street), (212) 582-1310.</p>
        <p>LANDMARC -- With the opening of this uptown branch of Marc Murphy's TriBeCa restaurant on Monday, the Time Warner Center's ''Restaurant Collection'' is finally full. Since the project was announced in 2001, there have been several false starts, and the ambitious original vision -- involving marquee chefs -- was scaled back. (Landmarc moves into the third-floor space that Charlie Trotter considered, then rejected.) Though it's a sprawling 300-seat restaurant, it manages to replicate the industrial look of Landmarc (TriBeCa), with open grills behind the bar and garage doors to private dining areas. The earthy, straightforward Italian- and French-accented menu is the same as downtown: Time Warner Center, Columbus Circle, (212) 823-6123.</p>
        <p>P*ONG -- On Friday the pastry chef Pichet Ong will open his own cafe, with sweets and savories served at tables and a counter. This is not your childhood soda fountain. As at other dessert-chef showcases around town, avant-garde trumps tried and true. Tarragon finds its way onto the raspberry panna cotta, cocoa caramel garnishes foie gras, and arugula ice cream is served with Roquefort soufflé. You will find Mr. Ong's signature tapioca Thai jewels, which he concocted for Spice Market, redesigned here. There are s'mores too, but in a cocktail: 150 West 10th Street, (212) 929-0898.</p>
        <p>REVEL -- Graydon Carter proved at the Waverly Inn that you don't need a phone number to fill a restaurant. For the past year, Paolo Secondo did Mr. Carter one better at this meatpacking district spot with a garden and a long copper bar: he omitted a name, too. Finally Mr. Secondo, who also has Barolo and I Tre Merli in SoHo, has given in. He has also expanded the menu to items like steaks, lamb and seafood, all served on hot rocks and in sizzling skillets. And he's finally hooked up the phone: 10 Little West 12th Street, (212) 645-5369.</p>
        <p>OPEN NOW</p>
        <p>RESTO bolsters the list of Belgian spots in the city: 111 East 29th Street, (212) 685-5585. FABIO PICCOLI FIORE offers standard Italian fare: 230 East 44th Street, (212) 922-0581. BOND ST. has reopened after a fire: 6 Bond Street (Lafayette Street), (212) 777-2500.</p>

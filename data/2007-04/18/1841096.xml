        <p>Ever since his films began to attract admiring attention from the international film festival crowd, the Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul has encouraged his tongue-tied Western fans to call him Joe. That friendly, disarming gesture reflects the sensibility behind the movies, which are at once stubbornly difficult -- resistant to summary, at times even to understanding -- and surprisingly warm and gentle. Unabashed art films that demand patience and close, quizzical attention, they are also generous, unpretentious and funny, posing thorny formal questions in a relaxed, democratic spirit.</p>
        <p>It is possible to feel, watching his earlier movies ''Blissfully Yours'' or ''Tropical Malady,'' that you just don't get, on a conscious, cerebral level, what Mr. Weerasethakul is trying to do. Yet at the same time you find yourself moved, even enchanted, by the beautiful, oblique stories unfolding before your eyes. It thus may or may not be helpful to know that the situations in his new film, ''Syndromes and a Century,'' were suggested by events in the lives of the director's parents before they became a couple. This information does not provide any clues about the plot, but it can help ground some of the film's fugitive moods of nostalgia and romantic longing, the feelings that attend a child's contemplation of the endless mystery of his own origins.</p>

        <p>Ever since his films began to attract admiring attention from the international film festival crowd, the Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul has encouraged his tongue-tied Western fans to call him Joe. That friendly, disarming gesture reflects the sensibility behind the movies, which are at once stubbornly difficult -- resistant to summary, at times even to understanding -- and surprisingly warm and gentle. Unabashed art films that demand patience and close, quizzical attention, they are also generous, unpretentious and funny, posing thorny formal questions in a relaxed, democratic spirit.</p>
        <p>It is possible to feel, watching his earlier movies ''Blissfully Yours'' or ''Tropical Malady,'' that you just don't get, on a conscious, cerebral level, what Mr. Weerasethakul is trying to do. Yet at the same time you find yourself moved, even enchanted, by the beautiful, oblique stories unfolding before your eyes. It thus may or may not be helpful to know that the situations in his new film, ''Syndromes and a Century,'' were suggested by events in the lives of the director's parents before they became a couple. This information does not provide any clues about the plot, but it can help ground some of the film's fugitive moods of nostalgia and romantic longing, the feelings that attend a child's contemplation of the endless mystery of his own origins.</p>
        <p>Like ''Tropical Malady,'' a lush, brooding mix of eroticism, fantasy and nature-worship set on the edge of the jungle, ''Syndromes and a Century'' is split in two. The first half takes place at a quiet rural hospital, while the second unfolds at a much larger and more modern urban medical complex. How the parts fit together is something of a puzzle. Each begins with the same conversation, an interview of a military doctor conducted by one of his new colleagues. In the first segment, we follow the interviewer, Dr. Toey (Nantarat Sawaddikul), a busy young woman with a kind but businesslike demeanor, through a series of recollections and encounters, at the center of which is a subdued almost-romance with an ''orchid expert'' named Noom (Sophon Pukanok).</p>
        <p>At the same time, a dentist befriends one of his patients, a Buddhist monk who confesses that his real dream is to be a D.J. But to refer to either of these threads as a fully formed plot would be to misrepresent Mr. Weerasethakul's approach to the material. It is more concerned with the unspoken implications of conversations than with what is said, and it is devoted to the sensual elegance of visual compositions rather than to their dramatic or expository content. The beauty of the film is an aspect partly of its patient attention to faces, tress, landscapes and architectures, and partly of the subtle precision of the camera movements.</p>
        <p>As the second part follows the jug-eared, sad-faced Dr. Nohng (Jaruchai Iamaram) through his work day, patterns and motifs suggest themselves. ''Syndromes and a Century,'' like its curious title, has the logic of a dream, a piece of music or perhaps a John Ashbery poem. Its coherence is evident; it is too lovely and lucid to be frustrating or dull. But it takes place just on the other side of conscious apprehension. (This makes the recent demand for cuts by Thai censors seem especially odd, since, at least to an outsider, there seems to be nothing politically or sexually provocative in the film. In any case, Mr. Weerasethakul has refused to make the changes and has issued a statement condemning the censorship.)</p>
        <p>The first time I saw ''Syndromes,'' I reached a point when an overall design seemed to be coming into view, but the final series of images, which include steam pipes in a hospital basement and an open-air aerobics class, pulled the rug out from under my developing interpretation. On subsequent viewings, I've come to appreciate both the clarity and the mystery of this film, which welcomes you into a world of simplicity and strangeness.</p>

        <p>A man halted the opening of his murder trial yesterday by admitting that he fatally shot his pregnant sister-in-law on Feb. 21, 2005, and hid her body in the trunk of her car in Jamaica, prosecutors said. The man, Steven Schiovone, 37, of Levittown, pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court to first-degree manslaughter, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Brown said Mr. Schiovone admitted that he shot Susan Ambrosino, 26, of Franklin Square, as they sat in her car. Prosecutors say he shot Ms. Ambrosino because she planned to tell her ex-husband, Mr. Schiovone's brother, that Mr. Schiovone was the father of her unborn child. Mr. Schiovone is expected to be sentenced to 30 years in prison.</p>

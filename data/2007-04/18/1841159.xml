        <p>Editorial on student loan scandal urges Congress to pass Student Loan Sunshine Act, which would make it federal crime for lenders to offer college officials anything of value in exchange for right to do business at school; also calls for strengthening Education Department's lending oversight office and revisiting Federal Family Education Loan Program that pays lenders unnecessary subsidies and protects them from defaults</p>

        <p>With Congressional hearings on the student loan scandal scheduled for next week, lawmakers are looking around for ways to root out the kinds of corruption uncovered in recent investigations by New York's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo. A good start would be to pass the Student Loan Sunshine Act, an important bill that was introduced months ago.</p>
        <p>The Sunshine Act would make it a federal crime for lenders to offer college officials anything of value in exchange for the right to do business at a given school. The new law would require the colleges to explain publicly why they had placed a given lender on the school's ''preferred lender'' list and would force the institutions to disclose any special deals that had been made behind the scenes.</p>

        <p>With Congressional hearings on the student loan scandal scheduled for next week, lawmakers are looking around for ways to root out the kinds of corruption uncovered in recent investigations by New York's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo. A good start would be to pass the Student Loan Sunshine Act, an important bill that was introduced months ago.</p>
        <p>The Sunshine Act would make it a federal crime for lenders to offer college officials anything of value in exchange for the right to do business at a given school. The new law would require the colleges to explain publicly why they had placed a given lender on the school's ''preferred lender'' list and would force the institutions to disclose any special deals that had been made behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>Congress also needs to strengthen the Education Department's lending oversight office, which has recently seemed more interested in protecting lenders' interests than in anything else. One possibility would be to place the lending oversight function in the inspector general's office of the Education Department, where it would be relatively safe from partisan tampering and influence peddling.</p>
        <p>Congress also needs to revisit the Federal Family Education Loan Program, under which the government pays lenders unnecessary federal subsidies -- and protects the lenders from defaults by borrowers -- when they lend to students. The program costs billions more than the rival direct-loan program, under which students borrow straight from the government.</p>
        <p>Under one proposal, the government would cut subsidies and force lenders to compete for the right to participate in the program, thus driving down costs. Some in Congress want to cut subsidies and direct the savings resulting from such a change into student aid. Either option would be better than the corrupt and wasteful program we have now.</p>

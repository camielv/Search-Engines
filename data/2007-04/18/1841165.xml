        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Catholic Debate Mounts on the Meaning of 'Just War,' '' by Peter Steinfels (Beliefs column, April 14):</p>
        <p>I would include among the criteria for a just war a response to a serious, imminent threat; just wars are normally defensive, although there are provisions for pre-emptive strikes.</p>
        <p>The seriousness and imminence of the threat from Iraq's supposed relations with Al Qaeda were among the debated issues before the invasion began, and one of the most commonly cited reasons for early opposition to the war.</p>
        <p>There are serious reasons for thinking that just-war theory has indeed come to argue for a presupposition against war. The indiscriminate bombing (on both sides) and the use of nuclear weapons in World War II are telling here, as are the deaths of civilian populations that in modern warfare are taken to be inevitable.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the distinction between military and civilian combatants is becoming increasingly blurred as terrorism -- not military threats -- is seen as the danger.</p>
        <p>The real tragedies of real people in truly violent situations should be a constant reminder of how strong the presumption against war should be.</p>
        <p>Ann R. Riggs  Nashua, N.H., April 14, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer, a Catholic theologian, is an associate professor of religious studies at Rivier College.</p>

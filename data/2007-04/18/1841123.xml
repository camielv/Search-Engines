        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced the reopening of the Staten Island Railroad yesterday, an important step in his plan to transform the way the city disposes of the thousands of tons of garbage it collects daily.</p>
        <p>The once abandoned and weed-strewn eight-mile line reconnects the borough with the national rail network, allowing freight traffic to leave Staten Island by rail for the first time since 1991.</p>
        <p>Reopening the rail line makes Staten Island the first borough to achieve one of the major goals outlined in the mayor's 20-year waste management plan, which the City Council approved last summer after nearly two years of political infighting. The centerpiece of the plan is to make the city rely more on barges and trains and less on trucks to carry garbage to landfills out of the state.</p>
        <p>The line is also expected to help the Staten Island economy, providing freight shippers direct rail access to the New York Container Terminal at Howland Hook, the borough's largest employer.</p>
        <p>City officials said the line would cut out thousands of truck trips on Staten Island each year, easing traffic on the West Shore Expressway and the Goethals Bridge.</p>
        <p>''Taking trucks off the road, minimizing their impact on communities, is going to mean safer, cleaner, quieter streets for generations to come,'' the mayor said. ''This really is the beginning of a real transformation for this city.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday's announcement was held in a chilly warehouse in front of mounds of smelly garbage at the Staten Island Transfer Station. Afterward, the mayor, surrounded by an entourage of sanitation and rail officials, went outside and, in a symbolic gesture, waved a railroad lantern at a waiting locomotive.</p>
        <p>The city began testing the line on April 2, moving some garbage to New Jersey from the transfer station, which receives garbage from all over the borough. The city expects to begin hauling all of Staten Island's garbage by ray by May 1.</p>
        <p>Although the Staten Island segment of the mayor's plan is under way, city officials made it clear yesterday that other key components of the transformation -- mainly building marine transfer stations in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan -- could still be years away as the city seeks environmental permits from the state. One of those, on the Upper East Side at 91st Street, has been beset by local and political opposition.</p>
        <p>For years, the city's garbage went to the mammoth Fresh Kills landfill, to the dismay of Staten Island political leaders and residents. Since the landfill was closed to residential trash in 2001, the city has struggled with how to dispose of the 12,000 tons of garbage it collects each day from homes, schools and municipal buildings.</p>
        <p>Now, the vast majority of that waste is shipped out by truck, eventually ending up in landfills in South Carolina, Virginia and other states. Some goes to an incinerator in Essex County, N.J.</p>
        <p>Under the new plan, each borough is responsible for putting its garbage into containers at private or city-operated transfer stations. From there it will be sent out of state by barges or rail.</p>
        <p>City Councilman Michael E. McMahon, who represents the northern part of the borough, called yesterday's announcement a Golden Spike moment, a reference to completion of the transcontinental railroad in the 1860s.</p>
        <p>''Firstly, we will move Staten Island's trash by sealed containers over rail, and secondly, we are reconnecting our borough to the rest of the continent by railroad,'' he said.</p>

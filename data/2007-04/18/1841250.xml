        <p>Israeli forces shot and killed a militant belonging to the radical Islamic Jihad group south of Jenin in the West Bank, Israeli security officials said. An army spokesman said troops identified Ashraf Haneisheh, who was wanted by Israel, and shot him after he drew his handgun. Palestinian news reports identified Mr. Haneisheh as a member of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades and said he had been ''executed'' by an Israeli undercover special unit. Earlier in the day, Palestinian militants slightly wounded four Israelis in a drive-by shooting near the Jewish settlement of Modi'in Ilit. Al Aksa Martyrs claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>

        <p>Correction of March 24 article on Wilton, Conn, high school canceling play about Iraq war; discussion of role of Gabby Alessi-Friedlander, student whose brother is serving in Iraq, should not have paraphrased opinions and should have included response from her or her mother to statements quoted</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on March 24 reported on a decision at a high school in Wilton, Conn., to cancel a play about the war in Iraq. It also discussed the involvement of Gabby Alessi-Friedlander, a junior, whose brother is serving in Iraq.</p>
        <p>The article paraphrased other students as saying that Gabby had ''circulated drafts of the script to parents and others in town.'' But The Times did not interview anyone who said he or she had received a copy of the script directly from Gabby, and it did not try to contact Gabby for a response. The article also paraphrased comments by Gabby's mother, Barbara Alessi, who told a reporter that she knew nothing about the play or her daughter's involvement, but she was not asked specifically about the circulation of the script.</p>
        <p>In fairness, The Times should have sought a response from Gabby or her mother about the classmates' comments, or omitted those statements. Contacted on Monday, Gabby told a reporter that she had never ''distributed or circulated'' any copies of the script.</p>

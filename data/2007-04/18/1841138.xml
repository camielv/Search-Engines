        <p>Hyundai Motor America in Fountain Valley, Calif., said yesterday that it would award its creative account to Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group. The assignment, with spending estimated at $600 million a year, had been handled since 2002 by the Richards Group in Dallas.</p>
        <p>Hyundai, part of Hyundai Motor of South Korea, selected Goodby, Silverstein after a review that began in late February. Richards did not take part, citing company policy.</p>
        <p>Goodby, Silverstein has created campaigns for automotive brands like Saturn, Porsche and Isuzu. The other agencies taking part in the review included Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas, which formerly created ads for Volkswagen; Kirshenbaum Bond &amp; Partners in New York, part of MDC Partners; Siltanen &amp; Partners in Santa Monica, Calif., which has been working for Hyundai on projects; and the New York office of Strawberry Frog.</p>
        <p>When the Hyundai review began, Goodby, Silverstein was already taking part in a creative review for another automaker, the Volvo division of Ford Motor. The agency withdrew from that review to pursue Hyundai.</p>
        <p>The Hyundai assignment is the second recent major account gain for Goodby, Silverstein. Two and a half weeks ago, Sprint Nextel chose the agency to create its consumer and business advertising.</p>

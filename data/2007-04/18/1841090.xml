        <p>Is it worth $9.99 to have someone buy and cook short ribs, shred them, season them with chipotle, arbol and pasilla chilies, mix them with slices of nopales (cactus paddles), fill two soft tortillas with the mixture and slather them with a rich sauce so you can have beef short rib enchiladas with salsa mestiza and cactus for dinner?</p>
        <p>That is one of eight prepared, ready-to-microwave main dishes devised by Roberto Santibañez, the culinary director of the Rosa Mexicano chain, and available online from FreshDirect. The enchiladas are excellent. Moist turbot and rice in a lusty Vera Cruz-style sauce ($9.99) comes close, but for its undercooked asparagus and chayote. In addition to the choice of prepared dishes ($8.99 to $13.99) are preseasoned meats and seafood ($2.99 to $11.99 a pound), including lush Berkshire pork chops with a rich guajillo chili marinade, ready to bake, broil or grill, $4.49 a pound; freshdirect.com.</p>

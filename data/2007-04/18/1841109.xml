        <p>Orange Broadband Shortlist Announced</p>
        <p>''Digging to America'' (Alfred A. Knopf), the novel by Anne Tyler of the United States about two Baltimore families who adopt baby girls from Korea, has been named to the shortlist for the Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction, an annual British award for works by women, the BBC reported. Ms. Tyler's book will compete for the $60,000 prize against ''The Inheritance of Loss'' by Kiran Desai from India, winner of last year's Booker Prize; ''Half of a Yellow Sun'' by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie from Nigeria; ''Arlington Park'' by Rachel Cusk from Britain; ''The Observations'' by the Belfast-born Jane Harris; and ''A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers,'' by Xiaolu Guo from China. The winner of the prize, for ''excellence, originality and accessibility in women's writing'' by an author writing in English, will be announced in London on June 6.</p>
        <p>Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra Moves to Symphony Space</p>
        <p>Arturo O'Farrill and his Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra will take up residence at Symphony Space in the 2007-8 season after performing since 2002 at Jazz at Lincoln Center. Cynthia Elliott, executive director of Symphony Space, said, ''The A.L.J.O.'s inaugural season is also Symphony Space's 30th-anniversary season, and it will be part of our new, expanded roster of music series and outstanding musicians, including Jon Faddis, Ursula Oppens, Meredith Monk and Mark O'Connor.''</p>
        <p>Country Music Awards</p>
        <p>''Before He Cheats,'' a hit video in which Carrie Underwood, above left, takes a baseball bat to an unfaithful boyfriend's ''pretty little souped-up 4-wheel drive,'' won prizes for video of the year, best female video and best video director on Monday night in Nashville after fan votes were tallied for the CMT Music Awards, The Associated Press reported. Kenny Chesney, above right, won the male video prize for ''You Save Me.'' (He is to appear on July 26 at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., and on Aug. 30 at Madison Square Garden.) Kris Kristofferson, who wrote the country classics ''Sunday Morning Coming Down'' and ''Help Me Make It Through the Night,'' received the Johnny Cash Visionary Award.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>A court-ordered auction of the rights to the O. J. Simpson book ''If I Did It'' yesterday was canceled because his surrogate company, Lorraine Brooke Associates, established to collect the reported $1 million advance, has declared bankruptcy, The Associated Press reported. The news agency attributed its report to David Cook, a lawyer for Fred Goldman, who is seeking to collect a $33.5 million judgment in a civil suit stemming from the slaying of his son in the case the book addresses.</p>

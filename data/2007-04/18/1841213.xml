        <p>The Richard Tucker Music Foundation and the Metropolitan Opera have made up. After several years of banning its contracted singers from appearing at foundation concerts, the Met is allowing them to perform. And the foundation has agreed to resume a $25,000 yearly donation to the opera, said Peter Carwell, its executive director. Met singers will take the stage for the first time in four years at a free community concert put on by the foundation on Tuesday at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan. They also appeared at a foundation fund-raiser in November. Mr. Carwell said the ban, imposed to protect the Met's own fund-raising and ticket sales, was lifted by the new general manager, Peter Gelb. ''Peter gets it,'' he said. ''He understands what we are trying to do.'' The roster for the Tuesday concert includes Maria Guleghina, Barbara Frittoli, Stephanie Blythe, Joyce DiDonato, Massimo Giordano, Salvatore Licitra, Oren Gradus and Samuel Ramey. The foundation, which supports young singers and is named for a legendary Met tenor, announced last week that Brandon Jovanovich, a 36-year-old tenor, had won its $30,000 Richard Tucker Award.</p>

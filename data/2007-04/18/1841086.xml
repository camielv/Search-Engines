        <p>Order coffee at the Roasting Plant, 81 Orchard Street (Broome Street), and instead of a barista pulling levers to fill your cup, a clerk will touch a computer screen.</p>
        <p>The correct amount of whole coffee beans, roasted on the premises, right, will then whiz and clatter through a network of transparent plastic pipes overhead and drop into a compact countertop machine to be ground according to the type of coffee ordered. The beans are then brewed, in one seamless operation.</p>
        <p>Regular coffee, as well as espresso, comes with an impressively creamy head, but it would not be mistaken for the cappuccino being prepared for Vanessa De Nola, right.</p>
        <p>A choice of six single-origin beans can be blended to order, even in a single cup. A house blend, either regular or decaffeinated, is also available.</p>
        <p>Coffee drinks are $1.75 to $4. Those sipped at the store, perhaps with a pastry from Tom Cat, are served in insulated glass cups, and those sold to go come in insulated paper cups.</p>
        <p>Mike Caswell, the founder and a partner, is an industrial engineer who worked for Coffee Connection in Boston and then for Starbucks. He adapted the brewing machinery from a Swiss model, and the rest of the system was built for him in Florida.</p>
        <p>The small roaster does its work in the window. Beans are available unroasted, or green, for $6.50 to $7 a pound; the prices double for roasted coffee, either whole beans or ground.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caswell recommends waiting 24 hours before using freshly roasted beans, to get peak flavor: (212) 775-7755.</p>

        <p>The first vaccine against avian flu won government approval yesterday, even as federal officials conceded its usefulness in a flu pandemic might be limited.</p>
        <p>The vaccine, made by Sanofi Pasteur, is directed against the H5N1 strain of influenza virus, which some public health experts say could possibly spark a deadly epidemic of flu in humans.</p>
        <p>The federal government has already stockpiled enough of the vaccine to treat 6.5 million people. But yesterday's approval by the Food and Drug Administration means the vaccine is no longer considered experimental and therefore could be dispensed during a pandemic without requiring each recipient to sign a form giving informed consent.</p>
        <p>The vaccine, approved for adults 18 to 64, will not be available for sale to the general public. It will be dispensed only by the government in the event of a pandemic under rules that have yet to be fully worked out.</p>
        <p>The vaccine, however, has several shortcomings. It is expected to protect only about 45 percent of people who get it. Moreover, achieving even the 45 percent rate of protection requires two injections 28 days apart, which could also slow the response during a fast-moving flu outbreak.</p>
        <p>It also requires high doses, limiting the number of injections that could be produced during a pandemic. The two injections combined contain 180 micrograms of antigen, the piece of the H5N1 virus designed to spur immunity. By contrast, a conventional flu shot contains 45 micrograms of antigen: 15 micrograms for each of the three strains it protects against.</p>
        <p>Norman Baylor, head of the vaccine office at the Food and Drug Administration, conceded the new vaccine was an ''interim measure'' until better products could be developed.</p>
        <p>''Ideally, yes, you would like a vaccine that would have a higher efficacy'' and that would also require a single dose and less antigen, Dr. Baylor told reporters on a conference call yesterday. But, he added, ''At this point, this is where we are.''</p>
        <p>Other vaccines are under development and some require far lower doses. Some use agents called adjuvants, which can raise the immune system's response to a vaccine.</p>
        <p>The approval of the vaccine made by Sanofi Pasteur, a division of French company Sanofi-Aventis, was not based on tests of people intentionally exposed to the H5N1 because it would be unethical to expose people to the deadly virus. And natural infections are rare and sporadic. Instead, the vaccine was given to volunteers whose blood was then checked for antibodies against H5N1.</p>
        <p>So far H5N1, which can ravage poultry, has been confirmed to have infected 291 people and killed 172 of them since 2003, mostly in Asia, according to the World Health Organization. Experts say that for a pandemic to occur, the virus would have to change in a way that makes it more easily transmissible from birds to people and from person to person.</p>
        <p>But such changes in the virus would also mean that the vaccines now being developed, including ones more potent than Sanofi Pasteur's, would lose some effectiveness.</p>

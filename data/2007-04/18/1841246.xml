        <p>Specialist Mario Lozano, the American Army soldier who fired on a car carrying Nicola Calipari, left, the deputy chief of Italian military intelligence, and Giuliana Sgrena, an Italian journalist rescued earlier after a month as an insurgent hostage in Iraq in 2005, went on trial in absentia in Rome. The trial was immediately adjourned until May 14 for technical reasons. Specialist Lozano, 37, is charged with voluntary homicide in the death of Mr. Calipari, who shielded the journalist during the shooting and is regarded as a hero, and with intent to kill in the wounding of Ms. Sgrena and another Italian agent. In interviews, Specialist Lozano has said the car was traveling too fast as it approached a roadblock on the way to Baghdad airport and did not respond to warning shots. In a report, the United States military cleared American soldiers of any responsibility.</p>

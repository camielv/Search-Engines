        <p>It is an uphill battle, but the House is right to confront the gross injustice that keeps the citizenry of the District of Columbia locked into that definitive grievance of the American revolution: taxation without representation. The 550,000 residents living in the shadow of the Capitol's endless exercise in democracy have no voting representative in Congress.</p>
        <p>A measure to partly rectify this by giving the District of Columbia a full House seat was on the verge of passage last month until some legislative chicanery sidetracked it. Proponents hope to move a gimmick-free bill to approval as early as this week, despite the possibility of a chilly Senate reception and a presidential veto.</p>

        <p>It is an uphill battle, but the House is right to confront the gross injustice that keeps the citizenry of the District of Columbia locked into that definitive grievance of the American revolution: taxation without representation. The 550,000 residents living in the shadow of the Capitol's endless exercise in democracy have no voting representative in Congress.</p>
        <p>A measure to partly rectify this by giving the District of Columbia a full House seat was on the verge of passage last month until some legislative chicanery sidetracked it. Proponents hope to move a gimmick-free bill to approval as early as this week, despite the possibility of a chilly Senate reception and a presidential veto.</p>
        <p>This creative measure is based on an unapologetic political deal. It would allow a full-fledged House representative for the District of Columbia -- likely to be a Democrat -- while awarding a fourth, probably Republican, seat to Utah for its growing population.</p>
        <p>Like so much in democracy, the deal is more pragmatic than perfect. Opponents cite constitutional requirements that elected representatives be from states. Proponents are at least as convincing in quoting constitutional passages that define Congress's powers to change things in the District.</p>
        <p>Historically, nothing has come easy for the District of Columbia's taxpayers. They had to wait until 1964 and the passage of the 23rd Amendment for the right to vote for president. Nine years later came grudging home-rule powers, with the city ever subject to whimsical dictates from Congress.</p>
        <p>The city's shadow delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, can only watch when democracy counts most, in a House vote. But she has impressive proxy support on this pending measure from empathetic Republicans led by Tom Davis of Virginia. Both houses should speed the bill to President Bush as a living example of the democratic principles we so often hear politicians invoke.</p>

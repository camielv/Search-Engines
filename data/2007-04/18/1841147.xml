        <p>The pound rose above the $2 mark on Tuesday for the first time in 15 years after a surprise increase in Britain's inflation rate spurred expectations the Bank of England would raise interest rates at least once more this year.</p>
        <p>The pound jumped as high as $2.0017, breaking $2 for the first time since 1992. The dollar has also been declining this year against other major European currencies, particularly the euro. On Monday, the dollar approached its record low of $1.3666 against the euro, on rising concerns about slowing economic growth in America. Early Tuesday afternoon, the dollar was trading at $1.3562 a euro in New York, touching $1.3594, its weakest since December 2004.</p>

        <p>The pound rose above the $2 mark on Tuesday for the first time in 15 years after a surprise increase in Britain's inflation rate spurred expectations the Bank of England would raise interest rates at least once more this year.</p>
        <p>The pound jumped as high as $2.0017, breaking $2 for the first time since 1992. The dollar has also been declining this year against other major European currencies, particularly the euro. On Monday, the dollar approached its record low of $1.3666 against the euro, on rising concerns about slowing economic growth in America. Early Tuesday afternoon, the dollar was trading at $1.3562 a euro in New York, touching $1.3594, its weakest since December 2004.</p>
        <p>The pound's rise came after reports that British inflation unexpectedly rose to 3.1 percent last month, the highest since January 1997, according to data released by the Bank of England.</p>
        <p>Investors said they expected the central bank to curb inflation by raising interest rates from 5.25 percent. The central bank has increased interest rates three times since last August.</p>
        <p>The rise of inflation beyond the Bank of England's 2 percent target comes at a difficult time for Gordon Brown, chancellor of the exchequer, who has been relying on his track record of generating economic growth to campaign for prime minister.</p>
        <p>For the first time since Mr. Brown granted the bank independence to set interest rates in 1997, Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, was required to send a letter to the government explaining why the inflation rate rose more than one percentage point above the bank's target and outlining plans to bring the rate back down.</p>
        <p>In the letter, Mr. King explained that higher prices for oil and food pushed inflation up but said the bank remained confident that the inflation rate would fall again within months.</p>
        <p>''Because there are long-term lags between changes in interest rates and their impact on inflation, the committee will continue to look through the short-term volatility in inflation over the next year or so,'' the letter said.</p>
        <p>Some economists and strategists are expecting the inflation rate to fall again as the impact of recent interest rate increases filters through the economy. Some energy companies have already started to cut prices.</p>
        <p>Yet, some risks remain, as rising oil prices could again push up energy costs and retailers could keep prices high to improve their margins on the back of a buoyant economy.</p>

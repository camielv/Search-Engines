        <p>The Iraq war, and the political climate surrounding it, have yet to produce a definitively great piece of theater. (Film has proved more responsive to their complexities.) But the current crises have surely given us plenty of bad theater, particularly at the margins, where young playwrights often seem to be pulling out steno pads and taking dictation from the angriest and most obstreperous parts of themselves.</p>
        <p>''Armed and Naked in America,'' a two-part series of short plays from the Naked Angels theater company, tackles the war and its ripple effects on the culture. It isn't as baldly aggressive as it sounds, and that is a good thing, but neither does it turn out to be quite as encompassing. In the first chapter, an evening of eight plays and two funny short films, the peculiar tension of American life at this moment seems somehow missing and, with it, the profound disenchantment, the powerlessness so many men and women feel at their ability to effect a difference.</p>

        <p>The Iraq war, and the political climate surrounding it, have yet to produce a definitively great piece of theater. (Film has proved more responsive to their complexities.) But the current crises have surely given us plenty of bad theater, particularly at the margins, where young playwrights often seem to be pulling out steno pads and taking dictation from the angriest and most obstreperous parts of themselves.</p>
        <p>''Armed and Naked in America,'' a two-part series of short plays from the Naked Angels theater company, tackles the war and its ripple effects on the culture. It isn't as baldly aggressive as it sounds, and that is a good thing, but neither does it turn out to be quite as encompassing. In the first chapter, an evening of eight plays and two funny short films, the peculiar tension of American life at this moment seems somehow missing and, with it, the profound disenchantment, the powerlessness so many men and women feel at their ability to effect a difference.</p>
        <p>The first grouping of plays (which ended on Sunday; the second continues through Sunday at the Duke Theater) begins with a young woman recounting her time of service in Iraq. It is a story told with the cadences of someone talking about an especially trying episode of traffic. The play, ''Woman at War,'' by Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, demands that its interpreter tread lightly, but the actress Zabryna Guevara indulges the surface of the words too enthusiastically, never taking us exactly where we need to be.</p>
        <p>''Woman at War'' is not the worst of the various efforts, however. That distinction belongs to the ''The Machine,'' by Betty Shamieh and directed by Marisa Tomei, a play that teases us into believing that it will explore the clichés about discrimination endured by minorities, when all it really does is present the clichés themselves. The staging, which has a young woman tossing through the paper shreds of the work of a censured Arab-American poet as if she were a 3-year-old trying to put together a broken toy, is earnest to the point of parody, dopey, maddening.</p>
        <p>''Cards'' by Theresa Rebeck imagines women playing a nervous hand of gin (or perhaps another game) in the post-apocalypse. It is well acted but, like ''Myrtle Beach,'' a play by the publicist-turned-filmmaker Dan Klores, it is notable largely for its conceit. In ''Myrtle Beach'' a dead soldier finds himself in conversation with his severed lower half, but the metaphor Mr. Klores is seeking for a body divided from its soul never really takes shape.</p>
        <p>What does take shape? The strongest plays in the first series were the least overtly political. One, ''Hero,'' by Deirdre O'Connor, gets under way in the bedroom of a young woman about to go off somewhere. Her boyfriend, a grocery store clerk, would clearly like her to stay, but she is determined. We think, for a moment, that she is heading to war, but she is really preparing to participate in a reality television show, something in the vein of ''Survivor'' and that she hopes will make her famous.</p>
        <p>The play isn't intended as farce; it is meant to evoke a universe of diminished opportunity, and when the girl, Natalie, tells her boyfriend that going off to live on leaves or whatever she is going to do is ''literally the most important thing in the world,'' we oddly find ourselves believing her.</p>
        <p>And we believe, as well, the pain of the deteriorating relationship at the center of Itamar Moses's funny, touching ''Szinhaz,'' which begins as sketch comedy -- an interview between a pretty translator whose English is terrible and a Russian filmmaker who can't speak it at all -- and arrives at an unsettling place.</p>
        <p>What ''Szinhaz'' was doing in this context was not really clear, but I was glad it was there, a reminder that the rending of intimate life is still among the most terrifying kinds of disintegration.</p>
        <p>''Armed and Naked in America'' continues through Sunday at the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; telecharge.com or (212) 239-6200.</p>

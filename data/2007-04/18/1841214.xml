        <p>While balancing on her prosthetic leg at the end of her samba routine, Heather Mills, below, fell during Monday's edition of ABC's ''Dancing With the Stars,'' which remained the night's leader in the ratings. According to Nielsen's estimates, this 90-minute variety show averaged 18.7 million viewers at 8 p.m., putting ABC on top over all, even as ''The Bachelor,'' which followed, drew 9.3 million viewers from 9:30 to 11. CBS, which ranked second for the night, led during that portion of prime time with ''The King of Queens'' at 9:30 (12.3 million) and ''CSI: Miami'' at 10 (15.2 million). Fox's new drama ''Drive'' garnered a last-place 5.7 million viewers in its official time-period debut at 8, but the serial drama ''24'' at 9 (11.1 million) helped Fox finish third for the night. NBC was fourth; neither its improv comedy ''Thank God You're Here'' at 9 (6.9 million) nor its ''Dateline'' special on the Virginia Tech shootings at 10 (6.4 million), fared better than last place.</p>

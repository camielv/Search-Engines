        <p>ABN Amro and Barclays said on Tuesday that they had extended the period of their exclusive takeover discussions until the end of Friday, giving them more time to reach an agreement as a rival bid looms.</p>
        <p>The banks said they were continuing their exclusive talks, which were initially scheduled to end Wednesday after 30 days, and were working on a combination agreement.

        <p>ABN Amro and Barclays said on Tuesday that they had extended the period of their exclusive takeover discussions until the end of Friday, giving them more time to reach an agreement as a rival bid looms.</p>
        <p>The banks said they were continuing their exclusive talks, which were initially scheduled to end Wednesday after 30 days, and were working on a combination agreement. They added that there was still ''no certainty'' that the discussions would lead to a transaction. ABN Amro's management came under increasing pressure Friday to clinch a deal with Barclays, possibly its last chance to avoid being broken up, after a group of three European banks, led by the Royal Bank of Scotland, requested their own takeover discussions with ABN Amro, plotting a three-way split of the spoils.</p>
        <p>ABN Amro, the largest bank in the Netherlands, said it would meet next week with the three parties to get a better understanding of their intentions, an ABN Amro spokesman said Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The prospect of a bidding war sent ABN Amro's shares, which have lagged those of rivals for years, to a record 36.4 euros in Amsterdam, giving it a market value of 69.5 billion euros, or about $94.21 billion, more than what analysts have said Barclays could afford to pay.</p>
        <p>Some analysts said the group, which includes the Royal Bank of Scotland, the second-largest bank in Britain behind HSBC Holdings; Banco Santander Central Hispano, the largest bank in Spain; and Fortis of Belgium, could afford to pay more because they could realize greater cost savings.</p>
        <p>Neither of the two suitors has yet disclosed any financial details of a possible bid.</p>
        <p>A takeover of ABN Amro, which has 4,600 branches in 53 countries, would be the biggest in the banking industry. ABN Amro started merger talks with Barclays last month after it came under pressure from hedge funds and other shareholders to either split itself up or seek a buyer following years of poor share price performance.</p>
        <p>Rijkman W. J. Groenink, ABN Amro's chief executive, has been trying to avoid a split of the bank he has been running for the last seven years.</p>

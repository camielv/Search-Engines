        <p>The city has agreed pay $150,000 to settle a lawsuit by a civil rights advocate who said a former senior police official kicked her in the head during a 2003 antiwar protest in Lower Manhattan, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The settlement averted a trial that was to begin later this month. The activist, Cynthia Greenberg, 37, had planned to offer as evidence a videotape of the encounter, which appears to show her being kneed in the head by the police official, Bruce H. Smolka Jr., a 33-year veteran of the department. Mr. Smolka retired in February as an assistant chief and commander of Patrol Borough Manhattan South.</p>

        <p>The city has agreed pay $150,000 to settle a lawsuit by a civil rights advocate who said a former senior police official kicked her in the head during a 2003 antiwar protest in Lower Manhattan, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The settlement averted a trial that was to begin later this month. The activist, Cynthia Greenberg, 37, had planned to offer as evidence a videotape of the encounter, which appears to show her being kneed in the head by the police official, Bruce H. Smolka Jr., a 33-year veteran of the department. Mr. Smolka retired in February as an assistant chief and commander of Patrol Borough Manhattan South.</p>
        <p>Connie Pankratz, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Law, said the settlement was reached on March 27. Newsday reported the settlement yesterday.</p>
        <p>The suit by Ms. Greenberg, charging that Mr. Smolka had used excessive force, drew interest among law enforcement officials and civil rights advocates, partly because of the sometimes turbulent career Mr. Smolka navigated while rising through Police Department ranks.</p>
        <p>In 1999, he was one of two commanders in charge of the Street Crime Unit when four officers under his command fired 41 shots and killed an unarmed man, Amadou Diallo. That unit was later disbanded. During his tenure as commander of Patrol Borough Manhattan South, he had major responsibility for the police response to several antiwar rallies, protests at the Republican National Convention in 2004 and the Critical Mass bike rides.</p>
        <p>The settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Smolka or the city. Ms. Pankratz confirmed the settlement amount, but had no other comment.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Moore, a lawyer representing Ms. Greenberg, said yesterday that the settlement was an indication that the city, which he said had indemnified Mr. Smolka against financial penalties, had admitted defeat. ''The fact that they are paying this amount can only mean that they believe a jury would be outraged,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The videotape of the May 5, 2003, protest shows Ms. Greenberg seated on the ground, locked arm in arm with another protester when she was confronted by Mr. Smolka. The video was made by another person who attended the protest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore said that Ms. Greenberg had clearly been kicked, but suffered no permanent injuries. In a deposition, Mr. Moore said, Mr. Smolka said that he did not intend to kick Ms. Greenberg, and that the blow may have resulted from her rocking back and forth, bringing her head into contact with his knee.</p>

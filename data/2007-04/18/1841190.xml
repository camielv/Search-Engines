        <p>Military prosecutors have dismissed charges against one of four marines charged with murder in the killings of 24 Iraqi civilians, including several women and children, in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005, the Marine Corps announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Lt. Gen. James Mattis, the commanding general in the case, also granted the marine, Sgt. Sanick P. Dela Cruz, immunity to testify against the three other enlisted men facing murder charges, the Marine Corps said.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Dela Cruz, a member of Company K, Third Battalion, First Marine Regiment, had been charged with killing five civilians in a house-to-house assault on Nov. 19, 2005, after a roadside bomb killed one marine and wounded others.</p>
        <p>The charges were dropped April 2 after the government said it had ''balanced his low level of culpability in the alleged crimes against the potential value of his testimony,'' a Marine Corps statement said.</p>
        <p>In addition to those charged with murder in the case, four marine officers -- two captains, a first lieutenant and the lieutenant colonel in charge of the Third Battalion -- were charged with dereliction of duty for failing to ensure a thorough investigation of the episode.</p>

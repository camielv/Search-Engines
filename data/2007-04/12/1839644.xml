        <p>''Open House: Architecture and Technology for Intelligent Living,'' an exhibition of visionary housing projects by 10 young architects, opens on Saturday at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. Standouts include Seoul Commune 2026, above left, a cluster of towers covered in vines that provide shade and regulate interior temperature, and the Jellyfish house, top right, which was designed to help clean toxic water on a stretch of reclaimed land on San Francisco Bay and is encased in an organic water jacket that reacts to changes in light and temperature. Dunehouse, center right, is sheathed in skin that responds to the climatic extremes of the Nevada desert, while Open the House!, above right, covers its occupants in temperature-responsive fabric. The show also includes vintage models of housing like Buckminster Fuller's 1928 Dymaxion House and the Monsanto House of the Future. Through July 1 at Art Center's South Campus, 950 South Raymond Avenue, Pasadena, (626) 396-4254 or artcenter.edu/openhouse.</p>

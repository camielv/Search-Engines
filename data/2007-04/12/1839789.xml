        <p>Thousands of fans were standing, but the two fearless combatants at Fenway Park were crouching. Daisuke Matsuzaka, the pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, was behind the mound and Ichiro Suzuki, the leadoff hitter for the Seattle Mariners, was beside the batter's box.

        <p>Thousands of fans were standing, but the two fearless combatants at Fenway Park were crouching. Daisuke Matsuzaka, the pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, was behind the mound and Ichiro Suzuki, the leadoff hitter for the Seattle Mariners, was beside the batter's box. Both were doing last-second stretching.</p>
        <p>At that moment Wednesday night, hardly anyone cared where Seattle's Félix Hernández was. Hernández was starting for the Mariners, but he was overshadowed by the tussle between Matsuzaka and Suzuki. Still, by the end of night, Hernández had easily eclipsed the two Japanese players as the most captivating player on the field.</p>
        <p>Hernández, not Matsuzaka, was the young, dominant pitcher. Hernández, not Matsuzaka, made a solid lineup look feeble. Hernández did what the dreamiest of Red Sox fans had hoped Matsuzaka could do by taking a one-hitter into the eighth inning.</p>
        <p>But, with Hernández only six outs away from accomplishing the feat, J. D. Drew opened the eighth by lining a fastball past a diving José López at second base and into center field. Hernández's shoulders slumped and he lowered his head. The Red Sox were relieved.</p>
        <p>Because of Hernández's powerful performance, the Mariners rumbled to a 3-0 victory. Hernández, a 21-year-old whose fastball was clocked at 97 miles an hour and who allowed only two balls to be hit to the outfield, finished with a one-hitter and stole the show from the highly anticipated matchup of Matsuzaka and Suzuki.</p>
        <p>''I knew the game was going to be a big game,'' Hernández said. ''It was a special night for me.''</p>
        <p>It was supposed to be a special night for Matsuzaka or Suzuki, or both. But Hernández, who had not pitched in a week, threw a robust fastball and a slider in the low 90s to increase his scoreless streak to 17 innings for the season.</p>
        <p>''Even in hitter's counts, he threw some balls that looked like they were disappearing,'' Red Sox Manager Terry Francona said.</p>
        <p>While hundreds of flashbulbs popped in the first, Matsuzaka and Suzuki were about 65 feet apart. They were poised, waiting. In a few seconds, it was 60 feet 6 inches. In a few more seconds, the moment unfolded that fans, especially those watching at 8:11 a.m. in Japan, wanted to see.</p>
        <p>It was Matsuzaka against Suzuki. It was Dice-K against Ichiro. It was the elite pitcher from Japan against the best hitter from Japan. Matsuzaka, the man of many pitches, used fastballs, sliders and a curveball against Suzuki, eventually nabbing the out by leaping to spear a chopper.</p>
        <p>After Matsuzaka snared the ball, he tossed it to first and received about as raucous an ovation as a pitcher will ever get for collecting one out. Suzuki popped out, struck out and grounded out in his other at-bats off Matsuzaka. Those faded in importance as Hernández kept piling up zeros. Matsuzaka had a decent outing, allowing three runs and eight hits in seven innings.</p>
        <p>''I think we're hyping him up so much, when he gives up three runs, it's like, Oh my God,'' Red Sox third baseman Mike Lowell said.</p>
        <p>Since Matsuzaka was making his first start at Fenway, the fans were thrilled to see the $103 million man and treated him with reverence. Some waved Japanese flags and held signs written in Japanese, trying to make Matsuzaka feel at home.</p>
        <p>Matsuzaka is already a cult figure here. He received one of the loudest ovations during pregame introductions Tuesday and shared a half-handshake, half-bow exchange with David Ortiz that will undoubtedly be mimicked on Little League fields in New England. Matsuzaka said that ovation gave him goose bumps and called Wednesday's cheers a ''grand welcome.''</p>
        <p>''I was disappointed that I wasn't able to respond to them in kind,'' Matsuzaka said.</p>
        <p>For Matsuzaka, opposing Suzuki was something he had been eager to do for a few months. Matsuzaka has never been intimidated by Suzuki. In fact, when Matsuzaka was 18, he struck out Suzuki three consecutive times the first time they faced each other. Suzuki struck out only one more time in his next 31 at-bats against him, but he was a pedestrian 8 for 34 (.235).</p>
        <p>Matsuzaka handled Suzuki again Wednesday, even brushing him back with a 92-mile-an-hour fastball in the seventh.</p>
        <p>''He's a special pitcher,'' Suzuki said. ''Not just to me, but as a professional pitcher.''</p>
        <p>Kenji Johjima, the Mariners' Japanese catcher, said the first thing that he would do before opposing Matsuzaka was ''pray to God.'' It worked as Johjima, who was 32 for 118 (.271) off Matsuzaka in Japan, doubled when Seattle scored once in the second. The Mariners added two runs in the fifth for a 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>About four hours before Matsuzaka's first pitch, there were 15 satellite trucks parked outside Fenway, waiting to beam Matsuzaka's pitches and Suzuki's swings around the world. Four television entities carried the game live.</p>
        <p>Francona reached back to his minor league managing career with the Chicago White Sox for a comparison. He recalled how one player from Class AA, a player who was known for what he achieved with a larger ball, was covered during a game against the Carolina Mudcats in 1994.</p>
        <p>''The return of Michael Jordan back to North Carolina was about as big as you can get,'' Francona said. ''I think Ted Koppel was there that night. I don't see him here tonight.''</p>
        <p>Apparently, Koppel was not here. Everybody who wanted to see Matsuzaka against Suzuki was here. Instead, everybody ended up raving about Hernández.</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 13, 2007, Friday  Because of an editing error, a sports article yesterday about the Seattle Mariners' 3-0 victory against the Boston Red Sox referred incorrectly in some copies to the pitching performance by Félix Hernández of the Mariners. He took a no-hitter into the eighth inning -- not a one-hitter, which was how he finished.</p>

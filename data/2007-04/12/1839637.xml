        <p>FOR even the most basic outing into the woods, experts advise packing a first-aid kit. But the kits' customary bulk can be a deterrent for some. At a pound or less, the lightweight soft-sided first-aid kits tested here make it possible to take along some measure of protection without weighing down a pack.</p>
        <p>Jon Tierney, a critical care paramedic and instructor with the Wilderness Medicine Institute, an outdoor educational organization, tested these kits over eight days in the woods near Machias, Me. He evaluated them for weight, size, ease of use, quality and organization of contents.</p>

        <p>Each kit had ample goods for a four-day trip for up to four people, he said, but none included enough pain medication for more than two days. Bulky instruction booklets ''are good to read at home'' but should be left there, he said. Instead, hikers and campers can rely on instructional cards included in some kits.</p>

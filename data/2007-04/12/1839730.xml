        <p>AWAITING DATA ON A CANCER DRUG Amgen said it would delay reporting first-quarter earnings until Monday to include data from an eagerly anticipated study of its Aranesp anemia drug among patients with small-cell lung cancer.

        <p>A FEEL FOR THE GAME A number of products have been developed to give video game enthusiasts a sense they are at a theme park, including vibrating chairs and speakers that produce wind gusts. [C7.]</p>
        <p>BLACKBERRY MAKER'S SALES Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, said that higher sales pushed its fourth-quarter profit higher, but also said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its practices in granting stock options. [C9.]</p>

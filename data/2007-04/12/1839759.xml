        <p>New York City Ballet has announced that it is offering free tickets to a final dress rehearsal of its new production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' on April 29. The tickets will be distributed beginning at 9 a.m. on Sunday at the New York State Theater box office. ''I've wanted to do this for years,'' said Peter Martins, the ballet master in chief of City Ballet and the choreographer of ''Romeo and Juliet,'' which is to open on May 1. ''We finally found someone to underwrite it.'' CIT Group is the sponsor of the rehearsal and also of the $15 tickets available throughout the spring season. Mr. Martins said these gestures were partly a tribute to Lincoln Kirstein, the co-founder of City Ballet, whose birthday centennial will be celebrated throughout the season. ''He believed that there could be an American audience for ballet,'' Mr. Martins said. ''And he was right.''</p>

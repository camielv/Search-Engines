        <p>A report in the Today in Business column in Business Day on Monday, about a recommendation by James J. Cramer, the host of the CNBC television show ''Mad Money,'' that investors sell Dendreon shares, misstated the timing of events after his comments. Dendreon shares began to rise two days -- not one day -- after the ''sell'' recommendation. (Trading was halted the first day, pending an announcement that Dendreon's prostate cancer vaccine had been endorsed by a Food and Drug Administration panel.)</p>

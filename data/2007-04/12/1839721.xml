        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Brooks (''A War of Narratives,'' column, April 8) depicts his recent encounter with Arab intellectuals as pointless because his Middle Eastern interlocutors rejected his narrative about the region (it's all about Arab failures).</p>
        <p>But in such a strategically vital region, isn't a United States-Arab dialogue that explores, investigates and explains opposing narratives just what is urgently needed?</p>
        <p>Such a dialogue would not lead to agreement, but it would help us better understand this part of the world and the ideas animating its politics -- and perhaps shape more effective policies.</p>
        <p>Amy Hawthorne  Washington, April 10, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is director of the International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Sooner or later, David Brooks would do well to recognize that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a major problem and that Arab frustration with the ever-delaying ''peace process industry'' is not a result of wild ''conspiracy-mongering.''</p>
        <p>The Palestinian narrative of uprooting, dispossession and subjection to Israeli colonization is powerful and in need of greater consideration by Americans.</p>
        <p>Yes, of course Arab scholars could be more ''introspective.'' So, too, could Mr. Brooks and those who continually seek to play down the centrality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to our current regional difficulties.</p>
        <p>Michael F. Brown  Washington, April 8, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is a fellow at the Palestine Center. His views are his own.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Arab claims that American foreign policy is controlled by Aipac show how far the Arab world is from understanding how democracies function.</p>
        <p>Aipac (the America Israel Public Affairs Committee) is an ideological public affairs committee composed of tens of thousands of volunteer members, including me.</p>
        <p>The right to petition our elected representatives is a fundamental American right, and other Americans are free to lobby against Israel. Ultimately, Congress decides. Jews are less than 3 percent of the American population.</p>
        <p>To suggest that Congress is made to act against its will by the Jewish lobby is an anti-Semitic myth worthy of the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion,'' which, not coincidentally, is still widely distributed in the Arab world.</p>
        <p>Steve Sheffey  Highland Park, Ill., April 8, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A War of Narratives'' (column, April 8):</p>
        <p>David Brooks doesn't give the historical narrative that would go far to help us understand the Mideast impasse.</p>
        <p>Ten years after it won the territories in the 1967 war, Israel elected a government dominated by nationalist extremists and religious zealots dedicated to the goal of a ''Greater Israel'' -- sovereignty over all the Holy Land from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River.</p>
        <p>This government launched a large project to build settlements in the occupied West Bank -- ''creating facts on the ground'' and ''creeping annexation.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, this territorial transgression evoked ever wider Palestinian resistance, and the cycle of violence, suffering and hatred rose to new heights and year after year resonated throughout the Middle East.</p>
        <p>The United States was involved because of its financial and political backing of Israel.</p>
        <p>The narrative, of course, is much more complicated. But this much can be said:</p>
        <p>If Israeli democracy had not taken this wrongful path, the present tragic and ominous crisis would not likely have come to pass.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Solomon  Evanston, Ill., April 8, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Brooks reports that ''moderate Arab reformers'' have traced the problems in Iraq, Iran and other Middle East hot spots to a country roughly the size of Massachusetts that dominates the affairs of its Arab neighbors and operates a puppet government in Washington as well.</p>
        <p>O.K., but what do the hard-liners think?</p>
        <p>Michael Smith  Cynthiana, Ky., April 8, 2007</p>

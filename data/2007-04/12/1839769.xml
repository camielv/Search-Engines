        <p>Dennis Kocken, the sheriff of Brown County, Wis., said Wednesday that he truly believed that no one was above the law -- not even the sheriff. He wrote himself a ticket last month after he was involved in an accident in the Village of Howard, outside Green Bay.</p>
        <p>Sheriff Kocken said the accident occurred after he started following a driver who had sped past him. As he moved into the lane behind her car, his attention was briefly drawn to a snowblower near the edge of the road.</p>

        <p>Dennis Kocken, the sheriff of Brown County, Wis., said Wednesday that he truly believed that no one was above the law -- not even the sheriff. He wrote himself a ticket last month after he was involved in an accident in the Village of Howard, outside Green Bay.</p>
        <p>Sheriff Kocken said the accident occurred after he started following a driver who had sped past him. As he moved into the lane behind her car, his attention was briefly drawn to a snowblower near the edge of the road.</p>
        <p>''I was picking up speed,'' he said, ''and wouldn't you know it, she slowed down to turn left, and I hit her.'' There were no injuries.</p>
        <p>Sheriff Kocken, 52, said he talked to other police chiefs, who said he did not deserve a ticket.</p>
        <p>''I still didn't feel good about it,'' he said. ''I couldn't sleep that night; it was bothering me.''</p>
        <p>He cited himself for making an unsafe lane change, and the fine was $160.80. He paid it on Wednesday, he said.</p>
        <p>And what about the driver of the other car? She got a ticket for not wearing a seat belt.</p>

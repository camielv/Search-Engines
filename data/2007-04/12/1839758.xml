        <p>Fox coasted to another easy victory in the ratings on Tuesday as the Top 8 ''American Idol'' contestants faced off under the mentorship of Jennifer Lopez, below, in a night of Latin-themed performances. According to Nielsen's estimates, the 8 p.m. show had 26 million viewers, considerably outperforming CBS's ''NCIS,'' which had 14.4 million viewers and ranked second for the hour. At 9, the former talk show host Leeza Gibbons became the third star eliminated from ABC's ''Dancing With the Stars,'' as Tuesday's results show attracted 17 million viewers, for a second-place finish behind Fox's ''House'' (21.6 million). For the night, CBS and ABC finished about even over all as distant runners-up to Fox. At 10, ABC's ''Boston Legal'' (10.5 million) edged ahead of a repeat of CBS's ''Criminal Minds'' (10 million). NBC ranked fourth over all.</p>

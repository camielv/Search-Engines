        <p>The Top 2 albums on the Billboard chart last week traded places in their second week of release, and five new records arrived in the Top 10. Last week's No. 2, the 24th installment of the pop series ''Now That's What I Call Music!,'' rose to No. 1 with 213,000 sales, and Tim McGraw's ''Let It Go'' (Curb) dropped one spot to No. 2, with 177,000, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The country singer Martina McBride's new ''Waking Up Laughing'' (RCA) is No. 3, with 144,000 sales; Hilary Duff's ''Dignity'' (Hollywood) sold 140,000, to open at No. 4; and ''Timbaland Presents Shock Value'' (Interscope), by the hit producer Timbaland, reached No. 5, with 138,000 sales in its first week. A re-release of Beyoncé's ''B'Day'' (Columbia), featuring ''Beautiful Liar,'' her hit new duet with Shakira, sent the album up 63 spots to No. 6. The Houston rapper Paul Wall's ''Get Money Stay True'' (Atlantic) opened at No. 8, and Alison Krauss's new ''Hundred Miles or More: A Collection'' (Rounder) bowed at No. 10.</p>

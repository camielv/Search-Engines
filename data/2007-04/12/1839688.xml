        <p>If you are vacationing by yourself or with just one other person, you may not always have a kind stranger handy to take your photo -- or you may not trust a stranger to return your camera. With an autofocus camera, you can shoot yourself at arm's length. But that close, a camera often exaggerates noses and leaves out most of the background.</p>
        <p>Good arm's-length picture-taking requires longer arms -- or a Quik Pod. A telescoping wand with a camera mount at one end, the Quik Pod adds about 18 inches to your reach and carries a diminutive curved mirror showing you roughly what the camera will see.</p>

        <p>If you are vacationing by yourself or with just one other person, you may not always have a kind stranger handy to take your photo -- or you may not trust a stranger to return your camera. With an autofocus camera, you can shoot yourself at arm's length. But that close, a camera often exaggerates noses and leaves out most of the background.</p>
        <p>Good arm's-length picture-taking requires longer arms -- or a Quik Pod. A telescoping wand with a camera mount at one end, the Quik Pod adds about 18 inches to your reach and carries a diminutive curved mirror showing you roughly what the camera will see.</p>
        <p>The Quik Pod Pro ($24.95) weighs less than a quarter-pound, collapses to a pocket-size 71/2 inches and comes with pocket and belt-loop clips and a carrying bag. The Quik Pod Pro Plus ($29.95) adds legs that turn it into a small tabletop tripod. Both are available from www.quikpod.com and many camera dealers.</p>
        <p>The Quik Pod can also be used for shooting over the heads of crowds or shooting in awkward places, like under a car. Its light construction limits it to cameras or camcorders weighing a pound or less, the kind most people take on vacation.</p>

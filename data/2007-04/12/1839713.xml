        <p>Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China began a three-day visit to Japan on Wednesday, in what both countries described as an important step forward in repairing diplomatic relations.</p>
        <p>Shortly after Mr. Wen's arrival, he and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held talks and issued a statement that promised, in general, to increase cooperation in economic, energy, environmental and military matters.</p>
        <p>''Both countries support each other's peaceful development, and will enhance political trust between the two countries,'' the statement read.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wen is the first Chinese prime minister to visit Japan in nearly seven years. Mr. Abe went to Beijing shortly after becoming prime minister last fall, making the first public move to defuse tensions between the nations, traditional rivals.</p>
        <p>Relations deteriorated under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who made annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial to Japanese war dead, including war criminals of World War II.</p>
        <p>China responded to Mr. Abe's visit by discouraging the kind of anti-Japanese content on television and the Internet that had fanned nationalist sentiment. Recently, China issued only muted criticism of Mr. Abe's denial that the Japanese military had directly coerced women into sexual slavery during the war.</p>
        <p>Still, little progress was made, in recent months or on Wednesday, on the flash points: disputed gas and oil fields in the East China Sea; visits to Yasukuni and other problems related to history; and suspicions each harbors about the other's military ambitions.</p>
        <p>The statement said China and Japan had agreed to ''look at history frankly and jointly build a beautiful future.'' Before his visit, Mr. Wen warned Mr. Abe against visiting the Yasukuni Shrine. Mr. Abe, a one-time committed visitor to Yasukuni, softened his position as prime minister, saying that he would neither deny nor acknowledge having visited the shrine.</p>
        <p>But news that Mr. Abe had quietly visited the shrine -- leaked strategically to the Japanese media last year -- could derail the current rapprochement. And other delicate anniversaries, most significantly the 70th anniversary of the Rape of Nanjing, occur this year.</p>
        <p>The statement also said, ''China said Japan should play a more constructive role in the international community.'' But China and Japan have been looking warily at each other's more assertive diplomacy.</p>
        <p>China has opposed Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, and is suspicious of its strengthening securities ties with the United States and Australia.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Japanese officials regularly criticize China's growing military budget and, in a dig at Beijing, talk of strengthening ties with Asian nations that share values of democracy and human rights.</p>

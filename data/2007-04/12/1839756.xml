        <p>After complaints from Hispanic leaders, PBS has decided to supplement Ken Burns's coming documentary about World War II with material examining the wartime experiences of Hispanic and American Indian veterans. The already completed 14-hour film, ''The War,'' won't be modified. But Florentine Films, Mr. Burns's production company, will assemble a team, including a Hispanic producer, to create additional material to run in conjunction with the broadcast, beginning on Sept. 23. The additional material will also be included on the DVD ''The War'' and in any subsequent broadcasts. Hispanic leaders praised the move. Mr. Burns, above right, in the middle of a 20-day promotional tour for his film, said in an interview that while the film was never intended to be encyclopedic or to tell every veteran's story, creating the new material was ''a win-win situation.'' He added that ''for us this was a discussion with an intent to work out the issues.'' The amount of new material has not been decided, he said, but added that he wanted to make sure it did not ''feel pasted on or token.'' PBS said it would also distribute to stations additional programs that deal with Hispanic contributions to the war.</p>

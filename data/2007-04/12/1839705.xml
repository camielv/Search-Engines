        <p>An Afghan journalist who was held hostage by the Taliban for a month and was killed this week, was buried in Kabul, his home city, on Wednesday, and his relatives and colleagues criticized President Hamid Karzai for not having done more to win his release.</p>
        <p>The journalist, Ajmal Naqshbandi, 25, was working as an interpreter for a correspondent with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Daniele Mastrogiacomo, when the two and their driver were kidnapped in Helmand Province on March 4. The driver was beheaded, but Mr. Mastrogiacomo was released March 19 after Mr. Karzai agreed to free five Taliban prisoners, in a deal that was widely criticized.</p>
        <p>Taliban spokesmen said they were demanding the release of two jailed comrades before they would free Mr. Naqshbandi. And in a telephone call to a journalist early this month, Mr. Naqshbandi appealed to Mr. Karzai for help.</p>
        <p>Sultan Mohammad, a relative of Mr. Naqshbandi, said some of the blame lay with Mr. Karzai and the foreign minister, Rangeen Dadfar Spanta, when they ''prematurely'' announced last week that there would be no further prisoner exchanges with the Taliban. On Sunday, Mr. Naqshbandi was killed.</p>
        <p>The head of the Association for Afghan Journalists, Said Aqa Hussain Sancharki, called on the government in a speech at the graveside to ''value the life of Afghans.''</p>
        <p>''He should have been freed at any price, even by exchanging 10 or 20 Taliban,'' Mr. Sancharki said.</p>
        <p>There has been widespread outrage over the whole case, not only at Mr. Karzai, but also at the Taliban because of the driver's beheading and because Mr. Naqshbandi was killed by having his throat slit, a method associated with the butchering of animals.</p>
        <p>The deputy minister for information and youth, Mohammad Naim Farahi, was one of several government officials who attended the funeral for Mr. Naqshbandi. ''We are witnessing the biggest calamity of our era,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the furor over the prisoner exchange for Mr. Mastrogiacomo has continued to dog the government. Forty Italian medical workers left Afghanistan on Wednesday in protest at the detention of Rahmatullah Hanifi, a medical worker from the Italian-run Emergency Hospital in Helmand, who acted as a go-between for the government and the Taliban in the swap. Dr. Abdullah Fahim, an adviser for the Health Ministry here, confirmed the pullout by the Italian medical personnel.</p>

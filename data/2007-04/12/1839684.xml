        <p>Most navigation systems talk to you. The Magellan Maestro 4050 also listens -- making it the first portable navigation device that does so, according to its maker. The spoken commands it understands include ''go home,'' ''reroute,'' and ''nearest restaurant.'' You can even tell it what kind of cuisine you're seeking.</p>
        <p>The device's AAA TourBook information, exclusive on Magellan Maestro models, provides an unusual level of detail, including AAA restaurant and hotel ratings, prices, parking, hotel amenities like swimming pools, listings of events and sights, and information about AAA-member roadside assistance. It also lists millions of other points of interest, like gas stations, A.T.M.'s and businesses, and can connect you to them, hands-free, through any Bluetooth cellphone.</p>

It comes with preloaded maps of all 50 states, Canada and Puerto Rico, plus windshield and dash mounts and a U.S.B. cable for computer updates. Also included are household current and automobile battery chargers.</p>

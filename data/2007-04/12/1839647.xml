        <p>Gus, the Toronto company known for its well-priced modern furniture, now has a New York store. The shop will carry the entire Gus line of furniture, lighting and rugs. Many of the pieces are from its Essentials Collection, which can be shipped within 10 days. The 2,000-square-foot space has been kept simple to mirror the furniture, said Dan Bowman, right, the store's owner. The 82-inch Jane sofa, above, is covered in synthetic suede ($1,895); the 60-inch Return bench is wood and stainless steel ($795). The vinyl Thompson side chair, behind Mr. Bowman, comes in black or white ($245). Gus New York, 207 West 18th Street, (212) 206-7065 or gusmodern.com.</p>

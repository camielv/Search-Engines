        <p>Magna, the Canadian auto parts manufacturer, said that a former president, Belinda Stronach, left, the daughter of the company's founder and controlling shareholder, Frank Stronach, would be returning to the company to be the executive vice chairwoman. The company said that Ms. Stronach would not seek re-election to the Canadian Parliament, where she has served since 2004. Magna has been discussed by auto analysts as a possible bidder for the Chrysler division of the DaimlerChrysler Corporation. ''My father is looking to the future, the company is facing important strategic decisions, and the Canadian and global auto sector and economy are in a period of great challenge,'' Ms. Stronach said in a statement.</p>

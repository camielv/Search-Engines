        <p>The body of a man who had been shot to death was found early yesterday morning by a state trooper along Route 280 in Newark, the authorities said. The trooper found the body along an on-ramp on the westbound side of the highway shortly after 1 a.m., said Sgt. Jeanne Hengemuhle, a state police spokeswoman. The man's identity was not released yesterday pending notification of his family, but officials with the Essex County prosecutor's office said the man had died from several gunshot wounds. No arrests had been made by last night.</p>

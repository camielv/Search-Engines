        <p>WHEN their corporate marriage took place in the fall of 2005, Gillette was from Mars and its new owner, Procter &amp; Gamble, was from Venus.</p>
        <p>Gillette, the maker of razors, Duracell batteries and Oral-B toothbrushes, knew how to talk to men. And Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes Pampers, Cover Girl cosmetics, Tide and Charmin, spoke with a very female voice.</p>
        <p>Nearly two years later, marketing executives from both sides say they have learned from each other's methods. The Gillette name adorns the New England Patriots' football stadium and the company sponsors numerous Nascar drivers' cars, so it has been teaching Procter about sports marketing and in-store advertising. And Procter managers -- who have long used the terms ''she'' and ''her'' in discussing their customers -- are sharing knowledge with their Gillette counterparts about target-marketing to consumers in different regions of the world.</p>
        <p>''P.&amp; G. knows women,'' said William Schmitz, a senior analyst with Deutsche Bank. ''Their whole thing was that 85 percent of the purchase decisions are made by women. Gillette was kind of the flip side.''</p>
        <p>Since the merger, Procter has announced plans to close many of its distribution centers, demonstrating the supply-chain cost savings of the merger, but it has also quietly laid the groundwork for vast changes in marketing across its brands. The $57 billion purchase of Gillette, company executives said in recent interviews, was as much about marketing as it was about buying brands, factories and manpower.</p>
        <p>Take Pampers. When the diapers brand introduced a new stretch technology last fall, it decided to forgo Procter's normal path of devising customized messages for local markets and instead to follow the Gillette way, sending out one global message that compared the diapers' stretchiness to caterpillars, saying that as a baby's stomach stretches in and out during the day, the diapers do, too.</p>
        <p>''We realized when we had a good idea, it transcended the globe,'' said Jane Wildman, Procter's vice president for global baby care.</p>
        <p>Some Gillette brands, though, have created more locally specific messages, using Procter &amp; Gamble's regional research tools. Procter has seven business regions, and Gillette has set up business units following the same format.</p>
        <p>In Japan, for instance, Procter found that men were particularly interested in product features. So when Gillette introduced its Fusion razors there last fall, it used the product name ''Fusion 5+1,'' emphasizing the fact that the razor comes with five blades and a trimmer on the back. It also created ads specifically tailored for a Japanese audience, instead of following its previous practice of adapting existing commercials.</p>
        <p>''We changed what we said about Fusion in a way in which we probably wouldn't have in the past,'' said Andrew Robertson, the chief executive of BBDO Worldwide, the Omnicom agency for Gillette. ''Not only are we going to understand what is the same everywhere, but we're going to look to see what is different everywhere.''</p>
        <p>Procter has also persuaded Gillette to add local voices to its ads. In February, Gillette announced that the sports stars Tiger Woods, Roger Federer and Thierry Henry would represent its brands. But because of Procter's influence, Gillette ads will feature an additional local athlete in each large market around the world.</p>
        <p>The most visible change in Procter's marketing will be its entrance into sports. Executives are considering which brands are the most likely candidates, said Jim Stengel, the global marketing officer for Procter.</p>
        <p>''Sports marketing wasn't a part of our DNA previously,'' he said. ''We've historically been seen as more of a household goods manufacturer, so contemplating about what sports and the passion behind sports could mean for our company is really exciting.''</p>
        <p>Procter has also called on Gillette to improve its in-store advertising system. Most consumer packaged goods companies use sales volume to determine how much they pay for in-store advertising.</p>
        <p>But Gillette developed a payment arrangement that goes a bit farther. It rewards stores based not only on sales volume but also on how much they use Gillette's marketing suggestions, which typically include recommendations on where in the store to place Gillette ads. Procter brands have switched to the Gillette method, which may increase sales of some Procter products, Mr. Schmitz said.</p>
        <p>As Gillette played the role of teacher inside stores, Procter took the lead in the digital world. Procter has introduced several Web sites that showcase its products in magazine-style formats -- like BeingGirl.com, which is aimed at teenage girls, and HomeMadeSimple.com, a site about housekeeping.</p>
        <p>Procter has encouraged Gillette to design branded entertainment programs. Gillette's ''Young Guns'' show, featuring Nascar drivers, will appear this summer on ABC.</p>
        <p>Executives from the two divisions say the learning has gone both ways.</p>
        <p>''A lot of times when two companies come together, one is in trouble and the other is doing very well, and that tends to make it very clear that for the most part it's going to be dominated by the one that was doing well,'' said John M. Darman, vice president for marketing at the Gillette. ''In this situation, both companies were on a roll.''</p>
        <p>The most tangible result may be eventual product integration between Procter and Gillette brands. Procter already combines its own brands on many of its own products, like Tide With Febreze and Tide With Downy, but Gillette does not.</p>
        <p>There are natural synergies, executives say: Gillette's Oral B toothbrushes could be sold with Procter's Crest toothpaste, and Olay, a Procter brand, could be added to Gillette's Venus razors for women.</p>
        <p>''What's the common bond of all these brands?'' asked Tami Jones, a Procter spokeswoman. ''That's where the marketing comes in.''</p>

        <p>Marc Anthony, the singer and husband of Jennifer Lopez, the singer and actress, has agreed to pay $2.5 million in back taxes, interest and penalties for 2000 to 2004, the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said yesterday. Mr. Morgenthau said that three companies controlled by the singer, whose real name is Marco Antonio Muniz, either failed to file tax returns or did not report all taxable income in those years. But he said Mr. Muniz was not prosecuted because he had relied on his brother Bigram Zayes, acting as his general manager, and his accountant, Philip Sarna, to pay taxes, and prosecutors could not prove that he was aware of their failure to pay taxes. Mr. Zayes and Mr. Sarna have pleaded guilty to tax law felonies, and will be sentenced to a conditional discharge after paying back taxes and fines. Mr. Muniz and Ms. Lopez file tax returns separately, prosecutors said, so Ms. Lopez is not involved.</p>

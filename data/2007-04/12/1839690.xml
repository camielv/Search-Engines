        <p>Senator John McCain's vigorous defense of President Bush's policy in Iraq on Wednesday served as a bold reminder of the remarkable degree to which his party, and all of its leading presidential candidates, stand united behind the president even as public support for the conflict erodes.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain declared in a speech at the Virginia Military Institute that defeat or surrender in Iraq was not acceptable, but he acknowledged that the hour was late and the result remained very much in doubt. He might well have been referring to his own political aspirations, the near-term future of the Republican Party and the historical verdict on George W. Bush's presidency.</p>

        <p>Senator John McCain's vigorous defense of President Bush's policy in Iraq on Wednesday served as a bold reminder of the remarkable degree to which his party, and all of its leading presidential candidates, stand united behind the president even as public support for the conflict erodes.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain declared in a speech at the Virginia Military Institute that defeat or surrender in Iraq was not acceptable, but he acknowledged that the hour was late and the result remained very much in doubt. He might well have been referring to his own political aspirations, the near-term future of the Republican Party and the historical verdict on George W. Bush's presidency.</p>
        <p>If polling is correct, Mr. McCain and the other Republican presidential candidates may have little choice. Republican primary voters, unlike the rest of the nation, appear to remain supportive of the president and the war, and the generals on the ground are asking for public patience in pursuing the new policy of pouring more troops into Iraq. Backing away from the White House and the war now could prove problematic for any candidate seeking the Republican nomination even if it could prove helpful in the general election.</p>
        <p>''They have to support the war because Republican voters are the only people left who still believe in it,'' George C. Edwards III, professor of government at Texas A&amp;M University, said of the Republican candidates. ''If you were purely cynical and did your polling and figured out where you needed to be to win the Republican nomination, you'd have to be supportive.''</p>
        <p>In a sign of Republican unanimity in the face of growing public skepticism, Rudolph W. Giuliani offered some surprising praise Wednesday of Mr. McCain's forceful defense of the war, saying, ''It takes courage to have those views.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain said Wednesday that his decision to give a speech embracing the war was devoid of any political calculation, even as he accused Democrats of acting out of politics in their handling of votes on troop levels and financing the conflict. Still, in giving such a speech when many Republicans have been advising him to turn to another subject, Mr. McCain could gain some political benefit for himself, and help the other candidates in his party.</p>
        <p>By going so far out on the pro-war limb, Mr. McCain has provided cover to his chief rivals, Mr. Giuliani of New York and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts. Both are supportive of the war and of the recent troop increase designed to bring Baghdad under control, but have not been nearly as muscular in their defense of the policy as Mr. McCain has been.</p>
        <p>''It does put McCain out there as a poster boy for backing Bush,'' Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, said, adding, ''But in the end all of them are going to have to face the voters and answer for their views on the war.''</p>
        <p>There is a potential upside for Mr. McCain and others who back the war. With some military officers saying the troop increase is showing early signs of success in pacifying Baghdad, the Republicans' strategy of aligning with the president could prove a daring but potentially fruitful move should the military strategy succeed.</p>
        <p>''If it works,'' Professor Edwards said of Mr. McCain, ''he gets to say, 'I was right.' ''</p>
        <p>And there are potential gains for Mr. McCain as he endures one of the roughest periods of his presidential campaign. For one thing, he noted pointedly in his speech that he had been an advocate of sending in more troops long before Mr. Bush embraced the policy. Should the new policy fail, Mr. McCain will almost surely note that he advocated an earlier and larger influx of new troops.</p>
        <p>As important, Mr. McCain's firm declaration of his support of an unpopular war -- in front of a gallery crammed with reporters and television cameras -- could go a long way, some of his aides said, to restoring what had been his signature image from 2000, as an independent candidate willing to take unpopular positions no matter the political risks. Mr. McCain has watched that image get scuffed repeatedly this year as he has sought to rebuild his reputation with the very conservatives he defied last time, in 2000.</p>
        <p>Further, some recent critical reporting by newspapers and television networks of Mr. McCain's trip to Baghdad last week has paradoxically been clearly welcomed in the McCain camp; one reason conservatives have been wary of him is because he is perceived as being close to the news media, and Mr. McCain made note of that in his speech.</p>
        <p>''I just returned from my fifth visit to Iraq,'' he said. ''Unlike the veterans here today, I risked nothing more threatening than a hostile press corps.''</p>
        <p>Beyond that, if the troop increase fails in its mission and Iraq continues its downward spiral, there could be an opening for an antiwar candidate in the Republican Party, or at least a candidate who is not so closely linked to administration policy as the current leaders are today. The obvious choice for that role is Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a decorated veteran who has been a consistent critic of the administration's conduct of the war and who has not ruled out a run for the presidency.</p>
        <p>Views are mixed on whether the Republican primary electorate, which tends to be more conservative than the party as a whole, would support a candidate who breaks with his president and other leaders of the party on such a critical issue as the war. The Republicans tend to be more hierarchical than the Democrats and are inclined to rally around their president, particularly when he is in trouble.</p>
        <p>''Could a Republican with good credentials in terms of national security like Hagel come out and be critical of the president and have Republican primary voters respond to him?'' Mr. Kohut asked. ''It's an open question, but he'd be walking a very delicate tightrope.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohut noted that his organization's most recent poll of 1,503 Americans showed that 67 percent of Republicans thought the situation in Iraq was going well, compared with 36 percent of independents and 24 percent of Democrats. He said that figure did not leave a lot of room for an antiwar Republican.</p>

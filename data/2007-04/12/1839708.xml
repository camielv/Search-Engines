        <p>THE T.G.I. Friday's restaurant chain has introduced a note of sanity into American food consumption by offering smaller portions at lower prices. This was a response to a slackening of demand in the restaurant business, as well as a desire by some consumers for more healthful eating options. These smaller portions are identified as ''Right Portion, Right Price'' options.</p>
        <p>Two cheers for T.G.I. Friday's.</p>
        <p>Why only two? Because if the chain is really serious about helping to change American eating habits, it can do more. Specifically, it can offer the smaller portion as the ''regular'' and allow customers to order ''supersized'' portions for a higher price. Although the two portions wouldn't change in size no matter what they were called, research evidence suggests that labeling the smaller portions ''regular'' will move far more people to order them than if the portions were labeled as they are now.</p>
        <p>Why? Ask yourself what happens if a customer simply orders the ''cajun shrimp and chicken pasta.'' Doing it the T.G.I. Friday's way, the customer gets the large portion; the other way, the customer gets the small portion. The two versions of the menu differ in what customers get if they say nothing about portion size. They differ in which option is the ''unmarked'' or ''default'' option. One ''default'' is a small portion, the other a big one.</p>
        <p>And the choice of default matters -- a lot. Some examples:</p>
        <p>In the United States as well as many European countries, when people renew their driver's license, they also decide whether they want to be organ donors. As a 2003 study in the journal Science found, more than 90 percent of Europeans are organ donors, while only about 25 percent of Americans are -- even though most Americans approve of organ donation. In the United States, to be an organ donor you have to sign a form. The reverse is true in Europe, where you are an organ donor unless you expressly indicate that you don't want to be.</p>
        <p>Another study, in The Quarterly Journal of Economics, found that when employers switch procedures for voluntary 401(k) contributions from ''opt in'' (you sign a form to take part) to ''opt out'' (you sign a form not to), rates of participation go up by as much as 30 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Results were similar when New Jersey and Pennsylvania both started offering lower cost, ''no fault'' (limited-liability) auto insurance at the same time. In New Jersey, but not in Pennsylvania, ''no fault'' was the default. More than 70 percent of car owners in each state chose the default. In the years since these programs were introduced, Pennsylvanians have paid millions more in auto insurance premiums than residents of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>These examples are not identical to the T.G.I. Friday's story. With these, doing nothing has a consequence -- organ donation or not, 401(k) sign-up or not -- whereas at T.G.I. Friday's, you have to order something. The T.G.I. Friday's version of setting a ''default'' is just what you get if you say nothing about portion size.</p>
        <p>But there is every reason to suspect that this version of a default will also have an effect. It's close to impossible to be neutral when setting options in front of people; the format almost always nudges people in one direction or the other. Most infer that the default option is the recommended one. In the case of T.G.I. Friday's, most people will probably infer that the unmarked portion size is the normal portion size, the appropriate portion size -- the one that most customers select.</p>
        <p>Now another opportunity to be sensitive to the potential importance of setting defaults is imminent: how will the medical community respond to the new evidence that magnet resonance imaging breast scans can pick up things that mammograms miss?</p>
        <p>The early consensus seems to be that these costly M.R.I.'s are a real breakthrough -- but not for everyone. Because of a reasonably high rate of false positives, M.R.I. scans will detect many tiny abnormalities that turn out to be benign, or not even tumors. Still, once the abnormalities are detected, there will be painful, stress-inducing, expensive follow-ups, some of which carry their own risks. So it is argued that M.R.I.'s are the right choice for women who are at relatively high risk for breast cancer, but not for the population at large.</p>
        <p>Will the average woman accept old-fashioned mammograms when M.R.I.'s are available? That will likely depend on how much effort doctors (and, of course, health insurance providers) make to identify mammograms as the default. If mammogram is the standard diagnostic tool -- if it is performed unless there are specific contraindications -- patients may continue to find it acceptable.</p>
        <p>But what if mammogram and M.R.I. are presented as more or less equal alternatives, each with its own set of risks and benefits, and the doctor and patient together decide which course to pursue? Given the history of medicine in this country (jumping at every high-tech option), I think many more women will insist on the M.R.I., with no obvious overall benefits but substantial additional costs -- medical, psychological and financial.</p>
        <p>Of course, if further research should indicate that M.R.I.'s are the right approach for everyone, the default will change. But unless the medical community takes steps to prevent it, the default may change without good reason, the result of patient demand. Default options should be selected thoughtfully, not carelessly, and should aim to enhance the well-being of affected parties.</p>
        <p>The legal scholar Cass Sunstein and the economist Richard Thaler call this thoughtful selection of defaults ''libertarian paternalism.'' It's paternalistic because defaults are chosen with an eye both on enhancing welfare and on the human tendency to do nothing (which increases as the number of options increases). It's libertarian because people can choose to opt out.</p>
        <p>Applied to T.G.I. Friday's menu modification, the ''paternalistic'' decision to make the small portion the standard one would almost certainly increase the number of customers who ''choose'' it by a wide margin. And the availability of the ''supersized'' portion would give people an alternative that satisfies libertarian concerns about freedom of choice. I suspect the same is true when it comes to the choice between mammography and M.R.I., though of course the stakes there are much higher.</p>

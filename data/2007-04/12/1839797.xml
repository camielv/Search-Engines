        <p>A city education official promised members of the City Council yesterday that the Education Department would take steps to address reports of problems on city school buses. The official, Kathleen Grimm, the deputy chancellor for finance and administration, said the department would hire more investigators, improve record-keeping and standardize reporting of problems on the buses. Ms. Grimm testified before the Council Committee on Education, which convened a hearing in response to a series of reports in The Daily News that detailed physical and sexual abuse by students, bus drivers and monitors on school buses.</p>

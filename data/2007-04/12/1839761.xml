        <p>The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center will present its annual Monte Cristo Award posthumously to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Wendy Wasserstein in a ceremony during a gala dinner at the Puck Building in Manhattan on April 30. Besides the award, given in recognition of distinguished careers exemplifying O'Neill's standard of excellence and pioneering spirit, Ms. Wasserstein will be honored by the establishment of an endowment in her name to support in perpetuity the center's open submissions program for aspiring playwrights.  With a book by Suzan-Lori Parks, a musical based on the life of Ray Charles and presented by the producers of the 2004 film ''Ray'' will open a month's run at the Pasadena Playhouse on Nov. 9, Variety.com reported. Set in a concert hall where he is recording his final live album, ''Ray Charles Live! -- A New Musical'' spans his 73-year life, unlike the movie, which ended in 1965 when he was 35. Sheldon Epps, artistic director of the Pasadena Playhouse, said, ''This is much more about what he feels about his life than the facts of his life.''  Willa Ford, the pop singer (''I Wanna Be Bad'') and alumna of ''Dancing With the Stars,'' is to star in a film about the life of Anna Nicole Smith, Variety.com reported. Filming of ''Anna Nicole'' is to begin next week.</p>

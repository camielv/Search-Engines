        <p>North Korea said it would begin shutting its main nuclear reactor within a day of retrieving about $25 million that had been frozen in a Macao bank because of American sanctions, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico said here on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>North Korea also offered to admit United Nations nuclear inspectors for the first time in more than four years, Mr. Richardson said after an official visit to North Korea and a meeting with senior officials there.</p>
        <p>Fulfilling those offers would resolve North Korea's long dispute with the United States Treasury. The disagreement has stalled multinational efforts to restart talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.</p>
        <p>In Macao, the financial authorities announced Wednesday that the holders of accounts at the bank, Banco Delta Asia, containing $25 million in deposits tied to North Korea were now free to withdraw or transfer the money unconditionally.</p>
        <p>''The North Koreans made it clear that they felt that the Treasury Department had fulfilled its obligations,'' Mr. Richardson said Wednesday at a news conference in Seoul. ''I'm optimistic about North Korea's willingness to return to the six-party talks and shut down the Yongbyon reactor.''</p>
        <p>The inspectors from the United Nations' nuclear monitoring arm, the International Atomic Energy Agency, could be invited back to North Korea this weekend, Mr. Richardson said.</p>
        <p>The last step the North Koreans were awaiting was an official notification from the Macao bank that the money was available, he said. That notification may be issued by Thursday morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson, a Democrat running for his party's nomination for president in 2008, led a delegation to North Korea that included Victor D. Cha, President Bush's main policy adviser on North Korea, and Anthony J. Principi, a former secretary of veterans affairs.</p>
        <p>The delegation's official mission was to recover remains of American servicemen killed in the Korean War, 1950-1953.</p>
        <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the group crossed the heavily guarded border between North and South Korea, completing a four-day trip to North Korea, and bringing what American officials said they believed were the remains of six American soldiers.</p>
        <p>While they were in North Korea, the delegation members also pressed North Korean officials to restart the stalled nuclear disarmament process. They met with the main nuclear negotiator for North Korea, Kim Kye-gwan, and other senior leaders.</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 16, 2007, Monday  A picture credit with an article on Thursday, about a visit to North Korea by Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico to retrieve the remains of six Americans killed in the Korean War, misstated the photographer's surname. The Associated Press picture, showing Governor Richardson and other officials with cases containing the remains, was by Foster Klug, not King.</p>

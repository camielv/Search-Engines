        <p>Women's Work: A Common Thread, a collection of 21 fabrics from Pollack, a company based in New York, was inspired by handmade textiles from the archives at the Museum of Art of the Rhode Island School of Design. Mark Pollack, the company's design director and an alumnus of the school, said he was ''amazed by the range of techniques'' he found there, and by ''the amount of labor that went into them.'' Hmong Plush ($130 a yard), below left, is a viscose jacquard based on a batik skirt made by women in Southeast Asia. A Touch of the Bubbly ($125 a yard), below right, a wool upholstery fabric, was suggested by pompoms on a 1960s American blouse. Gracious Home, 1217 Third Avenue (70th Street), (212) 517-6300.</p>

        <p>Under the Tree, an aptly named eight-foot-tall stainless steel outdoor shower, has multiple limbs. One is a shower head; the others can be used to hold towels, swimsuits or a bar of soap on a string. A garden hose can be screwed into the base of the shower, which is held in place by a 12-inch spike.</p>

        <p>Under the Tree, an aptly named eight-foot-tall stainless steel outdoor shower, has multiple limbs. One is a shower head; the others can be used to hold towels, swimsuits or a bar of soap on a string. A garden hose can be screwed into the base of the shower, which is held in place by a 12-inch spike.</p>
        <p>Michael Sieger, a partner at Sieger Design, a German industrial design firm, created the shower in 2002 for a design fair in Bologna, Italy, as part of a futuristic bathroom. It is being introduced to the United States by Conmoto, a German manufacturer of fireplace accessories and garden furniture. The shower sells for $2,600.

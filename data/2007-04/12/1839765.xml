        <p>A panel of the European Parliament is set to recommend that fees Europeans pay for making and receiving mobile phone calls outside their home markets be lowered by more than originally expected, dealing a setback to the telecommunications industry. Members of the Industry, Research and Energy Committee are expected to approve a proposal today to reduce so-called roaming charges to a maximum 0.40 euro for outgoing calls, and 0.15 euro for incoming calls, plus the value-added tax. Leaders of all major political parties on the 52-member panel except the Greens have endorsed the plan, according to a copy of their agreement obtained by The International Herald Tribune. If it receives the committee's support, the proposal will go before the full Parliament on May 9.</p>

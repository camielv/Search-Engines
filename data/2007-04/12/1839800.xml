        <p>A report by the San Francisco city attorney cleared Mayor Gavin Newsom of any legal wrongdoing in relation to a cash payment made to a woman with whom Mr. Newsom had had an affair. In February, Mr. Newsom confessed to having had a brief affair with the woman, Ruby Rippey-Tourk, his appointments secretary and the wife of his former campaign manager. In 2006, Ms. Rippey-Tourk sought treatment for substance abuse, leading to a payment of about $10,000, a cash-out of sick time accumulated as part of city program that allows the transfer of sick time to employees facing ''catastrophic illness.'' The report found that while the categorization of substance abuse as a catastrophic illness was unusual, there was no evidence that Mr. Newsom had pressured anyone.</p>

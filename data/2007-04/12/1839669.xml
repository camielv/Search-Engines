        <p>For 18 months, the Bush administration has maintained that the freezing of $25 million in an account in Macao linked to North Korea was strictly a law enforcement action against money-laundering, not a bargaining chip in a diplomatic effort to persuade North Korea to disarm its nuclear arsenal.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>For 18 months, the Bush administration has maintained that the freezing of $25 million in an account in Macao linked to North Korea was strictly a law enforcement action against money-laundering, not a bargaining chip in a diplomatic effort to persuade North Korea to disarm its nuclear arsenal.</p>
        <p>Now, in a startling reversal, the administration has formally acknowledged that the $25 million was indeed a bargaining chip and that the money would be returned to companies and individuals charged with illegal activities.</p>
        <p>The administration had said the money would be returned to North Korea for ''humanitarian'' purposes, but on Wednesday officials acknowledged that they had no way to ensure that would happen.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, they defended the action as necessary to secure the nuclear disarmament deal.</p>
        <p>''This was the right decision,'' said James R. Wilkinson, chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. ''At the end of the day, our government has been successful in fighting illicit behavior, and there is a much better chance at a change in North Korean behavior.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilkinson, who led an American delegation that returned last weekend after 13 days of negotiations in Beijing, said that although the money was being returned to its original owners, the administration had sent a strong signal of its power to crack down on arms proliferation, money-laundering and counterfeiting.</p>
        <p>''The international community now clearly understands just how potent our financial actions can be,'' he said. ''Our sanctions programs are designed to combat illicit behavior and help achieve political movement. Because of Treasury actions, both have happened in this case.''</p>
        <p>The fact that the money was going to the original account holders at the bank in Macao was first reported Wednesday by The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>It was not clear when the money would actually be transferred. Of the total, $13 million is to be returned to 17 individuals and companies deemed by the Treasury to have been involved in illicit activities, and $12 million more will go to 35 entities labeled by the United States as legitimate.</p>
        <p>American officials want a quick transfer because North Korea has said it will wait for all the money to be returned before it complies with its pledge to shut down a reactor and reprocessing facility at its nuclear center in Yongbyon. The deadline in the agreement is Saturday.</p>
        <p>The administration's reversal on the money was especially striking because President Bush, in January 2006, said the United States would not lift its restrictions on the frozen money just to get North Korea to negotiate.</p>
        <p>''There is no compromise when it comes to, you know, 'Hey, come back to the table so you can counterfeit our money,' '' he said. ''I mean, no. We are going to uphold the law and protect the currency of the American people.''</p>
        <p>But in fact the news report about the Macao bank, Banco Delta Asia, was the second disclosure in a week about the administration's waiving its tough approach to North Korea.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, The New York Times reported that the United States let an arms shipment from North Korea go to Ethiopia, despite a United Nations ban on purchases of North Korean arms.</p>
        <p>The shipment was cleared because Ethiopia was engaged in an offensive against Islamists in Somalia.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said that after Mr. Wilkinson returned from Beijing, Secretary Paulson and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice conferred with White House officials and a consensus was reached that the money would have to be returned if the deal with North Korea was to be salvaged.</p>
        <p>The North Korea deal has drawn criticism from conservatives, including some former officials of the administration.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Rice and her envoy on the matter, Christopher R. Hill, have defended it as a major diplomatic achievement.</p>
        <p>The United States did not freeze the funds. That action was taken by China and Macao, a semiautonomous region of China.</p>
        <p>But the Chinese authorities have been waiting for a green light to transfer the funds to North Korea and did not want to transfer them to another bank in their territory.</p>
        <p>At one point, the State and Treasury Departments announced that the money would be transferred to a Chinese bank for eventual use for ''humanitarian'' purposes by North Korea, but that arrangement fell through.</p>
        <p>In the end, what started out as a law enforcement action became a tool of diplomacy.</p>
        <p>''The North Koreans have said all along, 'Fix this problem and we'll deal with you,' '' said Charles L. Pritchard, a former administration envoy on North Korea and now president of the Korea Economic Institute, a policy group.</p>
        <p>He added that the Treasury Department became ''part of the problem'' in meeting North Korea's demands, and that with the return of the money, the administration had ''cut the cord'' from its officials who want to deal with North Korea by squeezing it as much as possible.</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 13, 2007, Friday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the Bush administration's acknowledgment that it froze $25 million in a Macao bank as a bargaining chip in negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear program described the frozen money incorrectly. It was distributed over 52 accounts of individuals or firms, including 17 with ties to North Korea. It was not in a single account.</p>

        <p>10 P.M. (ABC) NOTES FROM THE UNDERBELLY -- Jennifer Westfeldt, left, best known as the sexually confused journalist looking for Mr. -- or Ms. -- Right in ''Kissing Jessica Stein,'' stars in this new comedy series as Lauren, one-half of a couple embarking on parenthood. Peter Cambor plays her husband, Andrew, who narrates each episode. Melanie Paxson and Sunkrish Bala are Julie and Eric, slightly obnoxious expectant parents. Rachael Harris is Cooper, a divorce lawyer intent on keeping Lauren out of the mommy cult. And Michael Weaver is Danny, Andrew's childish buddy, who can't believe his friend no longer wants to trawl for hot women. Oh, but probably he does.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD OF UGLY BETTY -- A look back at highlights from the inaugural season of ''Ugly Betty,'' starring America Ferrera as the sartorially challenged Betty Suarez, struggling to stay afloat in a high-fashion world.</p>
        <p>8:30 P.M. (NBC) THE OFFICE -- Andy (Ed Helms) returns from anger management classes determined to make a fresh start with his Dunder-Mifflin employees. Meanwhile it's safety-training day in the office, and Michael (Steve Carell) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) make it their mission to point out the real dangers in the workplace.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) GREY'S ANATOMY -- To sleep, perchance to McDream? Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who played Denny Duquette, the dearly departed of the intern Izzie (Katherine Heigl, right, with Mr. Morgan), recaps moments from the past three seasons.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (CW) THE BRICK AWARDS -- This ceremony, billed as the first televised award show about changing the world, honors 12 young people for exceptional community service in categories ranging from education and the environment to health and community building. The prize: $10,000, to be applied toward the winner's project or organization ($5,000 will go toward scholarships for winners 18 and under), with an extra $15,000 going to four winners selected through online voting. Mandy Moore (above) and Dashboard Confessional will perform; LeAnn Rimes and Damien Fahey are hosts, and celebrities including Wyclef Jean, Susan Sarandon, Lance Armstrong and Jamie Lynn Sigler will present the statuettes, made from -- you guessed it -- actual bricks.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Style) THE TUDORS: ROYAL STYLEMAKERS -- Ripped bodices indeed. Anne and Jane Boleyn may have had a little help from the court couturier in capturing Henry VIII's lustful eye. Here, a history of 16th-century English fashion.</p>
        <p>10:30 P.M. (Showtime) THIS AMERICAN LIFE -- The cartoonist Chris Ware creates an animated short about watching life explode from behind a camera lens, and a young filmmaker sets out to expose his alcoholic stepfather, but ends up creating an endearing family portrait instead. Ira Glass provides perspective.</p>

        <p>From remarks yesterday to the cadets of the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Va.:</p>
        <p>'' I just returned from my fifth visit to Iraq. Unlike the veterans here today, I risked nothing more threatening than a hostile press corps. And my only mission was to inform my opinions with facts.</p>
        <p>We still face many difficult challenges in Iraq. That is undeniable. But we have also made, in recent weeks, measurable progress in establishing security in Baghdad and fighting Al Qaeda in Anbar province.</p>
        <p>To deny the difficulties and uncertainties ahead is an egregious disservice to the public. But as General Petraeus implements his plan to correct the flawed strategy we followed in the past and attempts to spare the United States and the world the catastrophe of an American defeat, it is an equal disservice to dismiss early signs of progress.</p>
        <p>And now we confront a choice as historically important as any we have faced in a long while.</p>
        <p>Will this nation's elected leaders make the politically hard but strategically vital decision to give General Petraeus our full support and do what is necessary to succeed in Iraq? Or will we decide to take advantage of the public's frustration, accept defeat and hope that whatever the cost to our security, the politics of defeat will work out better for us than our opponents?</p>
        <p>For my part, I would rather lose a campaign than a war.''</p>

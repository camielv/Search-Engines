        <p>When Lynne F. Stewart, the New York City defense lawyer convicted last year of aiding terrorism by smuggling messages out of prison for a client, was sentenced in October, her daughter Brenna took a day off to be there.</p>
        <p>The problem, according to a report released yesterday by New York City investigators, was that Ms. Stewart, a 46-year-old teacher and lawyer, used false documents to excuse her absence from her job as a physical education teacher at Bronx Leadership Academy II on the day of her mother's sentencing, Oct. 16, 2006, and on eight other days over the past two years.</p>

        <p>When Lynne F. Stewart, the New York City defense lawyer convicted last year of aiding terrorism by smuggling messages out of prison for a client, was sentenced in October, her daughter Brenna took a day off to be there.</p>
        <p>The problem, according to a report released yesterday by New York City investigators, was that Ms. Stewart, a 46-year-old teacher and lawyer, used false documents to excuse her absence from her job as a physical education teacher at Bronx Leadership Academy II on the day of her mother's sentencing, Oct. 16, 2006, and on eight other days over the past two years.</p>
        <p>Richard J. Condon, the special commissioner of investigation for the New York City School District, whose office prepared the report, has referred the findings to the Bronx County district attorney, and has recommended that Ms. Stewart be fired and be ineligible for future employment with the schools.</p>
        <p>Efforts to find a phone number for Ms. Stewart were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Calls to the school were directed to the Department of Education. Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the department, said only that the city was pursuing termination proceedings.</p>
        <p>There are many complaints of teachers' using fake excuses to skip work each year.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, city investigators found that Matthew Kaye, a social studies teacher at Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Queens, had called in sick for 11 days when he was on a professional wrestling tour.</p>
        <p>The same year, the principal of the High School for the Humanities in Manhattan heard Dorrit Matson, a music teacher in the school, introduced as the conductor of a public radio concert that was broadcast during a week when she had called in sick.</p>
        <p>''This is not so unusual,'' said Laurel Wright-Hinckson, a spokeswoman for the commissioner's office, which is part of the Department of Investigation. ''We receive hundreds of complaints from principals, teachers, friends, anonymous sources,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart, who began working in the city schools in 1984 and has been at the Bronx school for two years, was admitted to practice as a lawyer in 1995, so the commissioner is also referring the matter to the State Supreme Court's disciplinary committee for lawyers.</p>
        <p>In October 2005, the report said, Ms. Stewart used an altered death certificate to take bereavement leave; the deceased, her aunt, died three years earlier. In April 2006, Ms. Stewart tried to excuse two days off with a letter ostensibly prepared by ''Richard Zengotita, M.D.'' of New York-Presbyterian Hospital, bearing no return address or phone number. But no such person is employed by the hospital or licensed as a doctor in New York, the report said.</p>
        <p>According to the report, Ms. Stewart submitted two letters by her sister, Dr. Zenobia Brown, a Florida doctor not licensed to practice medicine in New York, to excuse absences in October 2006 and this January. Although Dr. Brown's January letter said Ms. Stewart was under her direct care for an ''acute contagious illness,'' the report said, Dr. Brown had sent it as an e-mail message from Florida to her sister, giving their mother's address and phone number as that of her office.</p>
        <p>On the day Brenna Stewart attended her mother's sentencing, a letter from her sister said she was unable to work because of her medical condition.</p>
        <p>The investigation of Ms. Stewart began in January, when Paulette Franklin, the principal of the Bronx school, told the commissioner's office that she had found discrepancies in the documents Ms. Stewart used to excuse her absences -- specifically, that the phone number on two doctors' notes matched Ms. Stewart's emergency contact number; that a doctor's note dated April 4, 2006, concerning absences that month specified the sick days as occurring in April 2005; and that the death certificate used to justify the day of bereavement leave in October 2005 had a falsified date of December 2005.</p>
        <p>Ms. Franklin told investigators that this January's letter aroused her suspicion because she recognized the doctor's telephone number as being one of Ms. Stewart's contact numbers, and because it ''didn't look professional.'' She then examined Ms. Stewart's personnel file.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart's mother, Lynne, 67, was sentenced in federal court in Manhattan to 28 months in prison for helping her client, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, get messages to his followers in Egypt.</p>
        <p>The sentence was a blow both to the prosecutors, who had sought a 30-year prison term, and to the Bush administration, which had cited the case as evidence of its toughness on those accused of aiding terrorism. Ms. Stewart's supporters argued that a long sentence would deter lawyers from defending terror suspects, and Judge John. G. Koeltl rejected government arguments that Ms. Stewart was a terrorist conspirator and a threat to society.</p>

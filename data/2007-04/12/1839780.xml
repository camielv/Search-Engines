        <p>Correction on April 7 column about tequila tasting</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Executive Pursuits column in Business Day on Saturday, about tasting tequila, referred incompletely to the territories in Mexico that are allowed to call their agave-based drinks tequila. The Tequila Regulatory Council of the Mexican government recognizes five territories -- not just Jalisco -- as sources for the production of tequila. The others are Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit and Tamaulipas. The column also misattributed a literary quotation about the process of going bankrupt, which was likened to overindulging in tequila. The reference to ''gradually and then suddenly'' was from ''The Sun Also Rises'' by Ernest Hemingway, not from F. Scott Fitzgerald.</p>

        <p>Science cannot fully explain the mystery of creation, Pope Benedict XVI said in comments about evolution that were published in a book on Wednesday. At the same time, he did not reject evolutionary theory or endorse any alternative for the origins of life.</p>
        <p>''I would not depend on faith alone to explain the whole picture,'' Benedict, a former theology professor, told his former students in September at a private seminar outside Rome on evolution, according to an account of the book from Reuters.</p>

        <p>Science cannot fully explain the mystery of creation, Pope Benedict XVI said in comments about evolution that were published in a book on Wednesday. At the same time, he did not reject evolutionary theory or endorse any alternative for the origins of life.</p>
        <p>''I would not depend on faith alone to explain the whole picture,'' Benedict, a former theology professor, told his former students in September at a private seminar outside Rome on evolution, according to an account of the book from Reuters.</p>
        <p>As pope, Benedict has not publicly defined his position, amid angry debates in the United States over ''intelligent design'' and questions raised two years ago by a leading cardinal on whether evolution was compatible with Catholicism.</p>
        <p>But his comments at the seminar, published in German by students who were present, seemed largely to avoid any such debate: Rather, they seemed consistent with his often-stated views on other subjects -- that science and reason, however valuable, should not rule out God.</p>
        <p>The debate over evolution, he said, concerned ''the great fundamental questions of philosophy: where man and the world came from and where they are going.''</p>
        <p>The book, called ''Creation and Evolution,'' was not publicly available on Wednesday, and Reuters did not say how it had obtained a copy.</p>
        <p>Apart from the pope's comments, the book includes essays from Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂nborn, a former student of the pope who set off much debate in 2005 after seeming to raise doubts about evolution.</p>
        <p>As Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, before he became pope two years ago, Benedict had expressed concern that on several fronts, including evolution, science was overstepping its competence, denying the existence of God and becoming its own system of belief. Though he did not reject evolution, he noted in the remarks quoted from the book that science could not completely prove evolution because it could not be duplicated in the laboratory.</p>
        <p>But, Reuters reported, he also defended what is known as theistic evolution, the idea that God could use evolutionary processes to create life, if not through the direct engineering suggested by ''intelligent design,'' which posits that life is so complex that it requires an active creator.</p>

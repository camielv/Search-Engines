        <p>Two new compact Dyson vacuums offer relief from dust and pet hair to anyone who needs a full-size model but does not have the space to store it. The Stowaway ($499.99), left, a canister with as much power as an upright, has a smallish body (11 inches wide by 17.7 inches deep) and a hose with attachments for hardwood and carpet that wraps around the machine when not in use. The Slim ($469.99), right, an upright, works on all types of floors and has a telescoping hose for hard-to-reach jobs. Both are bagless and have HEPA filters. At the Conran Shop, 407 East 59th Street, (866) 755-9079 or conranusa.com.</p>

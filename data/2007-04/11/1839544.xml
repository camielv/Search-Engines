        <p>A Queens assemblyman is warning that New York City's ratepayers could wind up paying for tens of millions of dollars that Consolidated Edison spent to repair its network in western Queens after a nine-day blackout last July.</p>
        <p>The assemblyman, Michael N. Gianaris, a Democrat from Astoria, sent a letter on Tuesday to Kevin M. Burke, Con Edison's chairman and chief executive, asking the utility to ''avoid using ratepayer subsidies to finance its repairs of the Long Island City network following the 2006 blackout in Queens.''</p>

        <p>A Queens assemblyman is warning that New York City's ratepayers could wind up paying for tens of millions of dollars that Consolidated Edison spent to repair its network in western Queens after a nine-day blackout last July.</p>
        <p>The assemblyman, Michael N. Gianaris, a Democrat from Astoria, sent a letter on Tuesday to Kevin M. Burke, Con Edison's chairman and chief executive, asking the utility to ''avoid using ratepayer subsidies to finance its repairs of the Long Island City network following the 2006 blackout in Queens.''</p>
        <p>At issue is an agreement that requires Con Edison to refund money to ratepayers when it earns more than an 11.4 percent profit in a given year. Mr. Gianaris said in his letter that he was concerned that Con Edison would deduct the $90 million it has spent repairing the Queens network from its earnings -- lowering the amount it must return to ratepayers if it meets the 11.4 percent threshold.</p>
        <p>Doing so, he said, could cost ratepayers tens of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>''I understand we have many disagreements, but the offensiveness of charging your victims tens of millions of dollars to repair the damage Con Edison caused is obvious to anyone,'' Mr. Gianaris wrote in the letter. ''Accordingly, I must insist that you stop adding insult to injury and agree to shoulder the complete burden of the repairs and upgrades to the Long Island City network.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Con Edison, Michael S. Clendenin, said that the utility had not had time to review the letter. ''Unfortunately, the media received this before we did, and before we could review it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The New York State Public Service Commission issued a withering report in January, which found that Con Edison's failure to adequately maintain, operate and oversee its electrical network was the ''overriding cause'' of the blackout, which lasted from July 17 to 25. The state estimated that 174,000 people lost power in the blackout.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gianaris said that, based on recent financial filings, he expected Con Edison earned enough in 2006 to meet the threshold for returning some money to ratepayers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gianaris is not alone in expressing concern about whether Con Edison would use its expenses related to the Long Island City blackout to lower the amount of excess earnings that must be returned to ratepayers. New York City raised the same issue in its initial response to the commission's report.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the city wrote that ''the city urges Con Edison to stipulate that the shared excess earnings calculations will be unaffected by the L.I.C. outage expenses.''</p>

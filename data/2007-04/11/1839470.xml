        <p>We seem far enough along now in the subgenre of reality television devoted to competitive style and re-imaging that a show about hairdressers facing off to produce up-dos that look like bowls of pad Thai seems vaguely quaint and well intentioned, as if it were 1995 all over again.</p>
        <p>In a world that has already given us on-camera liposuction, you must ask where, then, is something like ''Depilation Nation: 12 Angry Waxers Go After America's Freakishly Hirsute''?</p>

        <p>A new show on Bravo that features hairdressers facing off against each other for cash may seem like a very dull scissor.</p>

        <p>We seem far enough along now in the subgenre of reality television devoted to competitive style and re-imaging that a show about hairdressers facing off to produce up-dos that look like bowls of pad Thai seems vaguely quaint and well intentioned, as if it were 1995 all over again.</p>
        <p>In a world that has already given us on-camera liposuction, you must ask where, then, is something like ''Depilation Nation: 12 Angry Waxers Go After America's Freakishly Hirsute''?</p>
        <p>Maybe the Brazilian television industry is working on such a production at this very moment, but until that venture arrives, we are forced to contend with ''Shear Genius,'' a new series on Bravo, beginning tonight, that puts Jaclyn Smith and well-known salon owners like Frédéric Fekkai and Sally Hershberger in the position of judging a dozen young stylists fighting for a $100,000 prize and a chance to have one of their hairdos featured in Allure magazine.</p>
        <p>If I were a contestant on ''Shear Genius,'' the first thing I would do is summon up a healthy sense of activism. What is $100,000 in a universe of the $600 haircut for which Ms. Hershberger is celebrated? At the very least, these stylists ought to demand a lot more money, maybe a lifetime supply of pomade and an overhead dryer. They ought to form a reality-TV union.</p>
        <p>The stylists themselves come from all over the world. There is a bitter one, a haughty one, a cheekily self-regarding one. Each week they are presented with various challenges, technical and free-style. In tonight's episode, Theodore, a 22-year old from Ohio, distinguishes himself with the placement of a jewelry box atop a model's head.</p>
        <p>Tabatha, from Australia, thinks she has fallen short in the creative competition, even though she has done something that wonderfully seems to suggest ''The Lion King,'' as performed by Sid Vicious.</p>
        <p>''If I had a yard of tulle and 20 more feathers, it would have been explosive,'' she laments.</p>
        <p>But the volume of style and fashion now available on television has left us so accustomed to the outré speech patterns of creative service professionals that lines like that just lose their impact. And it does not help matters that Ms. Smith, in her role as host, acts as if she were presiding over a mortuary. ''Shear Genius,'' is, alas, a very dull scissor.</p>
        <p>Shear Genius  Bravo, tonight at 11, Eastern and Pacific times; 10, Central time.</p>
        <p>Ben Silverman and Mark Koops, executive producers; Holly Wofford, co-executive producer; Jaclyn Smith, host. Produced for Bravo by Reveille.</p>

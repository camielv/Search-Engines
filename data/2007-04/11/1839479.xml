      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the conservative candidate for president, suggests that pedophilia is most likely a genetic flaw; Ségolène Royal, the Socialist, does not seem to know that Taliban extremists are no longer running the government of Afghanistan; and Jean-Marie Le Pen, the ultrarightist, recommends masturbation instead of free condoms to meet young people's sexual needs.</p>
        <p>With 12 days to go before the first round of France's presidential election, the campaign has entered a phase of improvisation and even silliness that reflects the absence of any single defining issue and a frenzied competition to win over the country's large bloc of undecided voters.</p>
        <p>Every twist seems important. Monday was the ''official'' opening of the French campaign, in which all 12 candidates put up campaign posters across the country and began broadcasting short prepared free spots, of exactly the same length, on state-run television and radio stations.</p>
        <p>But a record 42 percent of French voters say they are undecided or can still change their minds, according to a recent survey by the CSA polling institute published in Le Parisien on Sunday. Among voters under the age of 30, the percentage is even higher, at 56 percent.</p>
        <p>''We're in an era where voters are more and more like shoppers,'' said Roland Cayrol, the director of CSA. ''They're comparing personalities and promises the way they compare products in a supermarket. The 'look' and the packaging is important. That means anything can change their vote -- from a defining event in the country to a candidate's absurd declaration.''</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is what the political scientist Jacques Gerstlé calls ''the absence of a dominant theme,'' unlike the last campaign in 2002 where the issues of security and unemployment monopolized the debate. The current campaign, he added, resembles a nationwide ''zapping,'' in which candidates flit from topic to topic -- from the woes of Airbus to the private wealth of the candidates to whether every French household should keep the nation's flag in the kitchen cupboard.</p>
        <p>All the top candidates have committed gaffes, but none so badly that they have ruined their chances in a volatile race, pollsters say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy, the front-runner, seems to be benefiting from the uncertainty. According to political analysts, his campaign seems more disciplined and less gaffe-riddled than those of the other main candidates. In a CSA poll published Monday, for example, 59 percent of registered voters polled said they expected him to win. In a subsequent CSA poll published Tuesday, more than 60 percent judged Mr. Sarkozy's campaign the most solid, precise and modern.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy continues the struggle to soften the law-and-order image he earned in his nearly four years as interior minister. So on a campaign stop to a Reblochon cheese-making factory in the Alps in late March, he did something he does not normally do, at least in public. He flirted.</p>
        <p>He enthusiastically kissed an apron-clad female employee on both cheeks, wrapping his arm around her shoulder.</p>
        <p>''I'm kissing you, eh,'' Mr. Sarkozy said. Posing for the cameras, he joked, ''Look how good-looking we are!'' and, ''My heart is beating!''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sarkozy's angry, tough-guy reputation still dogs him. In a book to be published Wednesday, Azouz Begag, who resigned as equal opportunities minister last week, accused Mr. Sarkozy of once threatening to assault him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Begag recounts an episode, just after the wave of unrest in France's suburbs in late 2005, in which he criticized Mr. Sarkozy for using the word ''scum'' to describe young delinquents. Mr. Begag said he received a phone call from Mr. Sarkozy, who, enraged, called him disloyal, and added, ''I'm going to smash your face.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy said Mr. Begag was lying.</p>
        <p>But the incident in the book reinforces the image of Mr. Sarkozy as a man more feared than loved. Over the weekend, his opponents and even the Roman Catholic archbishop of Paris, Msgr. André Vingt-Trois, criticized him for suggesting in an interview with a philosophical magazine that pedophiles had a genetic disposition to their perversion.</p>
        <p>''Man has free will,'' Monsignor Vingt-Trois said in a radio interview. ''What seems to me most serious is the idea that you can't change the course of destiny.''</p>
        <p>In the Socialist camp, there is a consensus that Ms. Royal, who is running second in the polls, has frittered away the advantages that come with running to be the first woman elected president of France. Her critics say she refuses to heed the advice of her advisers and has a penchant for adding new proposals as she goes along.</p>
        <p>Eric Besson, her former chief economic adviser, quit over differences with her, then savaged her in a book published weeks later. He described her as making decisions solo, improvising policies without forethought and then portraying herself as the victim of a male-dominated news media to gain an advantage.</p>
        <p>''I think, in all conscience, that Ségolène Royal should not become president of the republic,'' he wrote. ''I do not wish it for my country. I fear it for my children.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Royal also has been criticized for trivializing the issues. At a women's forum sponsored by Elle magazine last week, for example, she announced her three priorities for women: ending violence against women, securing more government aid for preschool children and putting the remains of Olympe de Gouges, the 18th-century feminist, into the Panthéon. The audience groaned.</p>
        <p>During a campaign trip on March 30, Ms. Royal announced a new government-subsidized initiative to put unemployed youths to work, only to be attacked by her own camp and the far left for coming up with a warmed-over version of the government's doomed job creation initiative put forth last year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Royal has been most gaffe-prone on foreign policy terrain. On a visit to China in January, she visited the Great Wall, wearing white, the color of mourning in China.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, in discussing the fate of two Frenchmen held hostage by the Taliban in Afghanistan, she called for United Nations-imposed penalties for rulers like the Taliban, as if unaware that the Islamic extremists had been ousted in 2001.</p>
        <p>When the interviewer pointed out that the Taliban were no longer in power, Ms. Royal ignored him and moved on.</p>
        <p>François Bayrou, the contender from the centrist Union for French Democracy party, who is running third in the polls before the first round, has run a largely gaffe-free campaign that has been criticized, however, for its vagueness. He has also been taken to task for portraying himself as a simple working farmer (his Web site shows him pitching hay on the family farm) when he has been a deputy in Parliament for more than two decades.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front who is running in fourth place in the polls, still seems to revel in making headline-grabbing statements.</p>
        <p>At the Elle forum, he defended his opposition to providing free condoms to high school students. ''For those who are fixated on it, I recommend 'manu militari,' '' a tongue-in-cheek reference to masturbation. ''This is the simplest method.''</p>

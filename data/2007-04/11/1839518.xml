        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Trash Talk Radio'' (Op-Ed, April 10):</p>
        <p>Thanks to Gwen Ifill for keeping the heat on Don Imus for his inexcusably hateful comments about the players on the Rutgers University women's basketball team.</p>
        <p>All of us -- not just African-Americans -- should be appalled by what Mr. Imus said about a group of young women who recently gave the entire country a televised lesson in teamwork, determination and dignity.</p>
        <p>These student-athletes are the kind of people we should put on a pedestal. The least we can do is defend them from a rock-throwing bigot.</p>
        <p>A two-week suspension is a slap on the wrist. CBS Radio and MSNBC should have the courage to pull the plug on Mr. Imus permanently.</p>
        <p>Susanna Levin  Portland, Ore., April 10, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Gwen Ifill made an argument against Don Imus's racial slur that was eloquent in its simplicity: we can act in a way that is consistent with what America claims to be all about, or we can appeal to the lowest common denominator, as Mr. Imus has.</p>
        <p>She brought tears to my eyes, and no one could express it better.</p>
        <p>Letty Oratowski  Basking Ridge, N.J., April 10, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have never listened to Don Imus on the radio. But based on the hurtful comments he made regarding the Rutgers women's basketball team, I conclude that he should have no place on the public airwaves. I fear there is no cure for a racism as ingrained as his. His apologies sound hollow and insincere. He doesn't get it, and I doubt he ever will.</p>
        <p>Carol A. Kurtz  Livingston, N.J., April 10, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Gwen Ifill is certainly in the right when she condemns Don Imus's derogatory comments concerning the Rutgers University women's basketball team. It is my hope that she, along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, will be just as vociferous in her condemnation of the many black rap artists who use language that is just as demeaning to African-American women.</p>
        <p>Larry Hoffner  New York, April 10, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Don Imus is a brash, outspoken, over-the-top radio host. But he is not a racist. He criticizes anyone and everyone with equal vigor. He made a stupid, out-of-order comment, and he has apologized sincerely for the remark. That should be enough.</p>
        <p>He should not have to denigrate himself further -- and certainly not to the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has his own closet full of skeletons going back to Tawana Brawley.</p>
        <p>Let's not forget Mr. Imus's ranch in New Mexico for children with cancer or his effort to raise money for a rehabilitation center for wounded veterans in San Antonio, to name just two items worthy of praise.</p>
        <p>He has done more than most in giving to those in need and should be applauded for it. Let's move on.</p>
        <p>Charles R. Cooper  New York, April 10, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>About Gwen Ifill's Op-Ed article:</p>
        <p>Was there ever such an insightful and moving Op-Ed commentary? Don Imus, read these words, sleep on them and wake up as an adult.</p>
        <p>George Schindler  Skillman, N.J., April 10, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''With Imus, They Keep Coming Back,'' by David Carr (The Media Equation column, April 9):</p>
        <p>I am an Asian-American and have listened to Don Imus every morning for the last 17 years. Don Imus is no racist. His show is fresh, irreverent, informative and spontaneous. He is the one talk show host who is truly neutral.</p>
        <p>It seems to me that it is only those people who are not regular listeners who accuse Don Imus of being a bigot or a racist. They do not know better.</p>
        <p>Don Imus is neither, as any regular listener of his show will tell you.</p>
        <p>Jamshed Batliwala  Southbury, Conn., April 9, 2007</p>

        <p>RUNDBACK--Robert Joseph, a resident of Mount Kisco, NY, and Naples, FL, died April 8, 2007, at the age of 80. Bob was a devoted husband, loving father, cherished grandfather and uncle. He was born in New Rochelle, NY, and graduated from Brooklyn College with a Masters degree at University of Illinois. Bob retired in 1994 after almost 40 years as Senior Vice President of First Investors Corporation, where he will always be remembered for his leadership and ''Monday morning meetings''. He loved tennis, treasured time with his family, and adored the many years spent boating and vacationing at his summer home in the Poconos. Known as an avid whistler, music enthusiast, and for his quick sense of humor, Bob will be dearly missed by the many people who loved him. Each of us who knew him will be better people for all he taught us. Bob is survived by his wife Carol, sons Frederic (of Pittsfield, MA) and John (of Briarcliff Manor, NY), daughter-inlaws Lili and Barbara, grandson Matthew, nieces and nephews Barbara, Susan, Spencer, Emily and Heather. Donations can be made in Bob's name to the SW Florida Parkinsons Association or a charity of your choice.</p>

        <p>An English teacher at the prestigious Newark Boys Chorus School has been arrested on charges that she had a sexual relationship with one of her 13-year-old students.</p>
        <p>The teacher, Tracy Booth, 31, of Mount Tabor, N.J., is charged with two counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault and one count of second-degree endangering the welfare of a child.</p>
        <p>The identity of the student was not released because of his age.</p>
        <p>The arrest on Monday followed a February meeting between the teacher and the student at the Comfort Suites Hotel on McCarter Highway here, officials said. Investigators with the Essex County prosecutor's office received information about the relationship from a worker with the state's Department of Youth and Family Services, who said he had received an anonymous tip.</p>
        <p>The county prosecutor, Paula T. Dow, said the relationship began in October and continued through the February meeting. She said investigators would probably file six additional charges against Ms. Booth regarding ''comparable actions with the student at her home in Morris County.''</p>
        <p>But, the prosecutor added, the charges ''do not necessarily involve penetration.''</p>
        <p>According to the school's Web site, Ms. Booth graduated from the College of New Jersey with a degree in elementary education and joined the school in 2003. She also worked as a student teacher in Venezuela and at the American Academy for Girls in Kuwait.</p>
        <p>Lawrence C. Emery, the headmaster at the school, said Ms. Booth, who was the fifth-, sixth- and seventh-grade language arts teacher and the fifth-grade homeroom teacher, was suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. It was unclear if the suspension was with or without pay.</p>
        <p>''These allegations are being taken very seriously by the administration, and our utmost concern is the safety and well-being of the student,'' Mr. Emery said in a statement. The school was closed this week for spring break, and calls to Mr. Emery for additional comment were not returned.</p>
        <p>Ms. Booth is being held in $200,000 bail and is expected to be arraigned within the next few days, Ms. Dow said. The Newark Boys Chorus School on Broad Street was founded in 1969 and currently enrolls 67 students, Mr. Emery said. The school is home to a choir that regularly performs across the country and in concert halls throughout the world.</p>

        <p>A lawyer representing some city construction contractors was arrested yesterday and charged with defrauding city agencies by allowing the contractors to avoid paying benefits to workers, federal prosecutors said. The lawyer, Steven Coren, 56, pleaded not guilty in Federal District Court to mail fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice, said Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the United States attorney in Brooklyn. Prosecutors charged that Mr. Coren helped set up a fund in which contractors for agencies including the City Housing Authority, the School Construction Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority deposited fringe benefits payments for workers, but the contractors then used the money for other purposes. Mr. Coren's lawyer, Marc L. Mukasey, said his client ''was at all times practicing law honorably and legally and expects to be fully exonerated.''</p>

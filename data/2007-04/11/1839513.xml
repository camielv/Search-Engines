        <p>THE AMERICAN DREAM, REVISED -- For years, homeownership made more sense than renting. But now it is clear that people who chose renting over buying in the last two years made the right move. Economix: David Leonhardt. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>IMUS AND THE RUTGERS TEAM -- For a third day, Don Imus apologized for a racially insensitive remark he made about the Rutgers women's basketball team, but it remained uncertain whether he could salvage his program, which generates about $20 million in annual revenue for CBS Radio, or his career. [A1.]</p>
        <p>A VIDEO GAME CHALLENGE -- Strauss Zelnick has taken on risky corporate restructurings in the past, but he says none have been as complex as a turnaround of Take-Two Interactive Software, where he was named chairman two weeks ago. [C1.]</p>
        <p>BETTING ON TRUMP -- Two years after Donald J. Trump's Atlantic City casinos emerged from bankruptcy proceedings, it is unclear whether they have the cash necessary to compete with their rivals. [C1.]</p>
        <p>CANADIAN GROCERY STRUGGLES -- The Loblaw Companies, Canada's largest grocery chain and once one of North America's most innovative retailers, is struggling with inventory problems and its first annual loss in 19 years. [C1.]</p>
        <p>5 YEARS IN JAIL FOR EX-ADVISER -- Martin A. Armstrong, the financial adviser who has spent seven years in jail on a contempt of court charge, was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay $80 million for running what prosecutors said was a $3 billion Ponzi scheme. [C3.]</p>
        <p>ALCOA RIDES A GROWING DEMAND -- Alcoa reported its most profitable first quarter ever as rising metal demand from China and the aerospace industry bolstered prices. Net income rose 8.9 percent, and sales 11 percent. Aluminum prices have more than doubled in the last five years. [C3.]</p>
        <p>CHINA UNHAPPY WITH U.S. MOVE -- The Chinese government expressed ''deep regret and strong dissatisfaction'' with the Bush administration's decision to file two complaints against China with the World Trade Organization. [C1.]</p>
        <p>ROMANIAN WORKERS MAKE AN EXIT -- Romania's low wages and recent membership in the European Union is fueling a wave of emigration that threatens to slow an economic boom in recent years. [C7.]</p>
        <p>A BID FOR PUMA -- The French luxury goods retailer PPR bid about $7 billion for Puma, the German sporting goods company, promising to keep its chief executive, Jochen Zeitz, at the helm of the company he turned around. [C3.]</p>
        <p>SPANNING THE GLOBE, AND THE WEB -- As NBC's ''Today'' prepares for this year's version of ''Where in the World Is Matt Lauer?'' Hyundai will sponsor a Web site following Mr. Lauer, left, as he travels the world. It is an example of efforts by networks to interweave traditional programming -- and advertising -- with the online media. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C4.]</p>
        <p>A BOOM IN RETAIL CONDOMINIUMS -- The market for retail condominiums in Manhattan has skyrocketed in recent years. More than 560,000 square feet of retail condo space sold last year, a sharp increase from 28,000 square feet in 2003. [C9.]</p>
        <p>EIGHT IN A ROW -- Stocks edged higher, giving the Dow Jones industrial average an eighth consecutive increase, though a modest one, for its longest streak since 2003. [C13.]</p>
        <p>QUESTIONS OVER FINANCIAL AID GIFT -- A federal Education Department official and financial aid directors at three universities received stock in a student loan company from the current president of the company in what could be a violation of securities law. [A13.]</p>
        <p>CELLPHONE CHARITY PROGRAM -- A new program that lets cellphone users send text messages to make donations to the American Red Cross has come under fire by a consumer group that points out the cellphone company can bill for the text message. [A15.]</p>
        <p>BIG DONATION TO COLUMBIA -- Columbia University plans to announce a gift of at least $400 million from John Werner Kluge, a 92-year-old billionaire whose multimedia company, Metromedia, was sold to Rupert Murdoch in 1986. [B1.]</p>
        <p>AN UPSIDE TO THE PET FOOD RECALL -- Stores and Web sites that sell pet food made from free-range meat, organic vegetables and brown rice say business has increased markedly since last month's recall of tainted pet food. [A14.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>HIGHLY PAID AT COACH -- The richest paydays are supposed to be reserved for Wall Street titans, oil barons and banking moguls. So what is a handbag maker doing atop the list? A special section on executive pay is at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>Business Briefing  Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>NEW CENTURY FINANCIAL, the subprime lender, has asked a federal bankruptcy judge to speed up the auction and sale of its main lending business while it still has value, according to court papers. (REUTERS)</p>
        <p>UNITED RENTALS, the equipment rental company, said that it was exploring a possible sale of the company and that its chief executive, Wayland R. Hicks, would retire in June. (AP)</p>
        <p>FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT at Levi Strauss &amp; Company rose 61 percent, providing the latest sign that the long-suffering jeans maker is finally on the mend. (AP)</p>

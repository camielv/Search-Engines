        <p>The government in Macao is prepared to release funds linked to North Korea that have been frozen in a local bank, the Treasury Department said Tuesday, as negotiations continued in order to meet the North's demand that the money be returned before it begins nuclear disarmament.</p>

        <p>The government in Macao is prepared to release funds linked to North Korea that have been frozen in a local bank, the Treasury Department said Tuesday, as negotiations continued in order to meet the North's demand that the money be returned before it begins nuclear disarmament.</p>
        <p>Delays in handing over about $25 million that has been frozen for 18 months in Banco Delta Asia, a small bank in the Chinese gambling enclave of Macao, are threatening to derail an agreement under which North Korea would shut down a plutonium-producing reactor by this weekend in exchange for economic aid.</p>
        <p>The top United States negotiator on North Korea's nuclear weapons program, Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state, said in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday that it was still possible to meet the deadline. ''Let's see how we do in the next couple of days,'' Mr. Hill said, according to The Associated Press. ''Obviously, it's a very important week, and I would say a crucial couple of days.''</p>
        <p>The United States and North Korea agreed last month that the money was to be transferred to an account controlled by the North at the Bank of China in Beijing, where the Chinese government has majority ownership. But the transaction has been held up by what officials in the Bush administration said were technical difficulties.</p>
        <p>In a development that could further delay the transfer, Beijing signaled Tuesday that the Bank of China had reservations about handling funds from a bank that the United States has accused of being a ''willing pawn'' in money laundering and the distribution of counterfeit currency on behalf of North Korea.</p>
        <p>In a statement released in Beijing and Washington, the Treasury Department said it understood that the authorities in Macao were ready to unblock the accounts linked to North Korea at Banco Delta Asia.</p>
        <p>''Based on previous discussions with Chinese, Macanese and D.P.R.K. officials, as well as understandings reached with the D.P.R.K. on the use of these funds, the United States would support a decision by the Macao authorities to unblock the accounts in question,'' the statement said, abbreviating North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>
        <p>The Macao Monetary Authority could not be reached for comment.</p>

        <p>BUCEY--Judy. We mourn the loss of our dear friend and colleague. Judy was a talented goldsmith and a gracious soul. She created exquisite jewels of precious gems. Judy was completely genuine; her kindness and gentleness were utterly natural. She brought light to all who knew her. We will miss you, and we will never forget you. Cecelia, Cheryl, Evy, Heike, Lois, Ronda, Tereze, and Tracy</p>

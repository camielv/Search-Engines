        <p>Editorial questions whether Pres Bush's pragmatic immigration speech in Arizona is meant to distance himself from 'inhumane' proposal circulated by Republicans, or whether he is playing to both sides of immigration debate; calls on Bush to clarify his position and to support comprehensive immigration reform in Congress</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>President Bush went to the Mexico border in Arizona on Monday and showed once again that immigration is an issue he understands. He said America suffers from a system that exploits people who come to do jobs that citizens won't do. He said the country needed ''a practical answer'' that promotes an orderly flow of legal immigrants, eases pressure at the border and opens a path to citizenship for the hidden 12 million who keep our economy humming. And he urged Congress to find that answer through a ''serious and civil and conclusive debate.''</p>
        <p>It was good that Mr. Bush made these points, as he periodically does. But there was a dissonance in his speech, because it came only two weeks after he and a group of Senate Republicans circulated a list of ''first principles'' about immigration that amounted to a huge step backward for efforts to fix a broken system in a reasonable, humane way.</p>

        <p>President Bush went to the Mexico border in Arizona on Monday and showed once again that immigration is an issue he understands. He said America suffers from a system that exploits people who come to do jobs that citizens won't do. He said the country needed ''a practical answer'' that promotes an orderly flow of legal immigrants, eases pressure at the border and opens a path to citizenship for the hidden 12 million who keep our economy humming. And he urged Congress to find that answer through a ''serious and civil and conclusive debate.''</p>
        <p>It was good that Mr. Bush made these points, as he periodically does. But there was a dissonance in his speech, because it came only two weeks after he and a group of Senate Republicans circulated a list of ''first principles'' about immigration that amounted to a huge step backward for efforts to fix a broken system in a reasonable, humane way.</p>
        <p>It proposed new conditions on immigrant labor so punitive and extreme that they amounted to a radical rethinking of immigration -- not as an expression of the nation's ideals and an integral source of its vitality and character, but as a strictly contractual phenomenon designed to extract cheap labor from an unwelcome underclass.</p>
        <p>New immigrant workers and those already here would all be treated as itinerant laborers. They could renew their visas, but only by paying extortionate fees and fines. There would be a path to legal status, but one so costly and long that it is essentially a mirage: by some estimates, a family of five could pay more than $64,000 and wait up to 25 years before any member could even apply for a green card. Other families would be torn apart; new workers and those who legalize themselves would have no right to sponsor relatives to join them.</p>
        <p>In a country that views immigrants as its lifeblood and cherishes the unity of families, the Republican talking points were remarkable for their chill of nativism and exploitation. They were also unrealistic. The hurdles would create huge impediments to hiring and keeping a stable work force, while pushing the illegal economy deeper underground.</p>
        <p>The thrust of Mr. Bush's speech leaves little room for a vision as crabbed and inhumane as the one he and his party have circulated. It's hard to tell whether his plainspoken eloquence in Yuma was meant to distance himself from those earlier and benighted talking points, or whether he has simply been talking out of both sides of his mouth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush should clear up the confusion. He should reaffirm the importance of family-based immigration and of an achievable path to citizenship for those willing, as he put it, ''to pay their debt to society and demonstrate the character that makes a good citizen.''</p>
        <p>Clarity and forcefulness from Mr. Bush are important because the prospects for a good immigration bill this year are so uncertain. The Senate plans to take up the issue next month, but there is no bill yet, and the talking-points memo shows the debate drifting to the hard right. Edward Kennedy, the Senate's most stalwart advocate of comprehensive reform, has been left in the lurch as the Republican presidential hopefuls John McCain and Sam Brownback have run away from sensible positions to court hard-line voters. A decent bipartisan House bill, sponsored by Representatives Jeff Flake and Luis Gutierrez, may not get the hearing it deserves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made a strong case for comprehensive reform on Monday. He should keep it up -- publicly and forthrightly, as he did this week, and forget about backroom negotiations that produce harsh political manifestoes to appease hard-liners.</p>

        <p>The body of an Afghan journalist abducted and slain by Taliban insurgents after they freed his Italian colleague in a prisoner trade was delivered Tuesday to Kandahar's hospital. The physician on duty confirmed the identification and said the cause of death was a slit throat.</p>
        <p>The physician, who identified himself only as Dr. Zafar, said the body of the slain journalist, Ajmal Naqshbandi, would probably be flown on Wednesday to his hometown, Kabul, on Afghanistan's commercial airline, Ariana, or a helicopter provided by NATO forces.</p>
        <p>Dr. Zafar did not explain how he had confirmed Mr. Naqshbandi's identity or provide details on who had taken his body to the hospital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Naqshbandi was working as an interpreter for the Italian journalist, Daniele Mastrogiacomo of La Repubblica, when they and their driver were seized on March 4 in Helmand Province, a Taliban stronghold.</p>
        <p>The kidnappers beheaded the driver and threatened the two others with death, but they released Mr. Mastrogiacomo on March 15 in exchange for five Taliban prisoners held by the Afghan government.</p>
        <p>That exchange, which the Italian government helped to negotiate, was the first in which prisoners had been openly traded for a hostage in either of the wars that the United States and its allies are fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. The exchange was criticized by the United States and other nations, which said it would encourage further abductions and make victims more vulnerable to ransom demands.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the Taliban announced that it had killed Mr. Naqshbandi after efforts to arrange a second prisoner trade had failed.</p>
        <p>News of the killing was greeted with fresh anger, particularly in Italy, where Prime Minister Romano Prodi was accused by political opponents of a double standard by making a deal for Mr. Mastrogiacomo but not Mr. Naqshbandi.</p>

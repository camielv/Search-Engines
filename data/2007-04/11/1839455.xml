        <p>A new book, ''The Produce Bible: Essential Ingredient Information and More Than 200 Recipes for Fruits, Vegetables, Herbs &amp; Nuts,'' by Leanne Kitchen (Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, $29.95), may be too big to haul to the Greenmarket, but it would pay to peruse it at the start of each season or even each month.</p>
        <p>The text is enlivened with stunning photography and each entry is followed by one or more recipes. I have no doubt that a gooseberry shortcake with a cream filling and lattice top will perfume my kitchen in a couple of months, just as the delicate fish in ginger broth did recently. The roasted beets with horseradish cream took care of some of the fresh horseradish left over from Passover.</p>

        <p>The book's sections on fruits and vegetables are divided into categories, including citrus, tropical and pome fruits; and leaves, fungi, tubers and fruit-vegetables like peppers and tomatoes.</p>
        <p>I'd note that mangoes are available not just in summer, as the book says, and that the smallish golden ones, in the market now, were ignored. But that's just a quibble.</p>

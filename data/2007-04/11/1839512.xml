        <p>In a surprise move, Henry Winterstern, who abruptly resigned as chairman of the independent studio First Look in March, has been named co-chairman of the studio, the company announced on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The studio has undergone a major executive shuffle and refinancing since last month, when Mr. Winterstern left in the wake of a financial squeeze, personnel issues and the failure of the studio's first three releases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winterstern said he left because the board declined to finance his purchase of a production company to supply the company with more movies; the company did not give a reason at the time.</p>
        <p>Since then, the independent film producer Nu Image acquired a controlling interest in First Look.</p>
        <p>Avi Lerner, the co-chairman of Nu Image who joined forces to reacquire the company after Mr. Winterstern resigned, was named the other co-chairman of First Look on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winterstern will focus on financing deals, while Mr. Lerner, whose company is mainly known for genre and thriller films, will concentrate on movie production and foreign financing.</p>

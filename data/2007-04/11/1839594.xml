        <p>The Parks and Recreation Department announced yesterday that a policy of allowing dogs off leashes during overnight hours will become effective next month. Beginning May 10, owners with a license and proof of a current rabies vaccination will be permitted to let their dogs roam in designated areas of city parks from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. Under an unofficial policy, the department has for years not given tickets to dog owners who let their pets run free at night in parks.</p>

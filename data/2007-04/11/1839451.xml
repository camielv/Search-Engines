      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>''Rock the Bells'' is the story of one man's labor of love to reunite the original members of the Wu-Tang Clan for a 2004 hip-hop concert in San Bernardino, Calif., and it demands neither familiarity with the music nor a hankering for rhyme. Instead Casey Suchan and Denis Henry Hennelly's lively documentary grabs hold of the backstage drama and doesn't let go until the last weary fan has shuffled off home.</p>
        <p>The film's harried hero is Chang Weisberg, an independent-music promoter who refinances his home to realize his dream of a Clan reunion. Against him are an irritable police department, thousands of frustrated fans and his notoriously unreliable headliners. As Mr. Weisberg copes with sound system failures, an overwhelmed security team and performers' last-minute requests for per diems and ''herb,'' his mother and aunt wrangle an avalanche of cash in the tiny ticket booth. Meanwhile, Ol' Dirty Bastard, a founding member of the clan who began life as Russell Jones, is holed up in his hotel room and refusing to perform.</p>

        <p>The film's harried hero is Chang Weisberg, an independent-music promoter who refinances his home to realize his dream of a Clan reunion.

Meanwhile, Ol' Dirty Bastard, a founding member of the clan who began life as Russell Jones, is holed up in his hotel room and refusing to perform.</p>
        <p>Capturing onstage and off with equal energy -- at one point only the inspired freestyling of artists like Redman and MC Supernatural stand between Mr. Weisberg and an all-out riot -- ''Rock the Bells'' is a fascinating glimpse of a dreamer and a music culture that has always depended on dreams.</p>
        <p>Rock the Bells  Opens today in Manhattan.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Human hubris is reaching new heights (''Backyard Pests? Think of Them as Dinner,'' April 4). In an urban landscape with few enough opportunities for contact with living things other than Homo sapiens, Steven Rinella has launched a war on the few species who have learned to survive with humans in our denatured world of concrete and cement. When we no longer feel the childish joy of watching frolicking squirrels, when we just ''thump them with a hammer,'' we are beyond cynical and inhumane: we are cruel and heartless and lost as a society.</p>
        <p>I suggest that Mr. Rinella be delivered into the Great North Woods with only a knife for survival if he needs to deal with his primitive longings for trapping and skinning our fellow creatures. Let him leave the few furry and feathered inhabitants of our city alone to scurry and scamper and provide a morning bird song.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Sparrows and squirrels are among the least pesky of all New York City creatures. I'll bet Mr. Rinella doesn't eat rat.</p>
        <p>ROSE CONSTANTINE  New York</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>All our songbirds are protected by federal and state laws, and ''thumping'' wild animals with a hammer is a crime, covered under cruelty-to-animals statutes. Migrating birds have enough problems as it is, and certainly don't need to be illegally trapped and killed by the likes of Mr. Rinella, apparently for his amusement.</p>
        <p>I spent 25 years in law enforcement in Suffolk County, N.Y., and can tell you that a number of people have been arrested and convicted of similar acts. I only hope such a fate befalls this so-called gourmet chef, and that they take away his ''thumping'' hammer as well.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Since Steven Rinella's recent New York arrival, his macabre activities -- stealing pigeons, battering backyard sparrows and squirrels -- threaten any free-living animals who manage to live among us.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rinella, who authored a cookbook based on consuming animals whose freedom the chef has usurped, says cooking without ''game'' isn't fun -- as if systematically disrespecting other conscious beings merits admiration, or at least interest.</p>
        <p>Animal rights is a movement to overcome everyday domination, and to value other creatures' interests in living on their own terms. Plant-based cuisine puts that principle into action immediately. Thus the cookbook author, chef or anyone with access to a kitchen decides whether our culture moves in a nonviolent direction. The sign of a mature society might well be the idea that we could have a whole lot more fun, and enjoy our planet fully, were respect a hallmark of our species.</p>
        <p>PRISCILLA FERAL  Darien, Conn.</p>
        <p>The writer is the president of Friends of Animals.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Even though I'm an animal lover and a vegetarian, currently watching squirrels and birds peacefully enjoying a spring day outside, I find this article neither amusing nor relevant to ''Dining Out.'' The next time Mr. Rinella is rolling around on the ground from a painful shot in the eye of fluid released from a goose gallbladder, maybe he should consider the torture he inflicts on these helpless creatures with his homemade traps.</p>

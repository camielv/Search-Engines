        <p>A Rikers Island inmate was charged yesterday with trying to hire someone he believed was a hit man to kill his mother, prosecutors said. The inmate, Joseph Salvio, 30, of Astoria, is accused of asking an undercover police officer to kill his mother in exchange for three of her fur coats, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Salvio was serving a four-month sentence for drug possession when he tried to arrange the killing, Mr. Brown said. He added that Mr. Salvio told the undercover officer to make the killing look like a robbery at his mother's home in Astoria and said he could keep three coats -- a mink, a fox, and a raccoon -- worth $10,000.</p>

        <p>William Kentridge, who conceived and directed the visiting production of ''The Magic Flute'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Monday night, is a black-and-white man. His flat scenery is not so much painted as rubbed and scratched by charcoal on white paper. Not surprisingly Mr. Kentridge is interested, if not obsessed, by early motion pictures and their first attempts at animation.</p>
        <p>From flickering screens onstage birds fly in little hiccups of movement. An animated rhino does endearing back flips. Cut-out suns and moons are beamed with calculated awkwardness across the stage. These faux-primitive re-enactments of early film are one side of Mr. Kentridge's exploration of this Mozart opera. Another is his determination to illustrate the power of the Enlightenment at the end of the 18th century and how it captured this magic-theater blend of the mystical and the down-to-earth for its own.</p>

        <p>William Kentridge, who conceived and directed the visiting production of ''The Magic Flute'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Monday night, is a black-and-white man. His flat scenery is not so much painted as rubbed and scratched by charcoal on white paper. Not surprisingly Mr. Kentridge is interested, if not obsessed, by early motion pictures and their first attempts at animation.</p>
        <p>From flickering screens onstage birds fly in little hiccups of movement. An animated rhino does endearing back flips. Cut-out suns and moons are beamed with calculated awkwardness across the stage. These faux-primitive re-enactments of early film are one side of Mr. Kentridge's exploration of this Mozart opera. Another is his determination to illustrate the power of the Enlightenment at the end of the 18th century and how it captured this magic-theater blend of the mystical and the down-to-earth for its own.</p>
        <p>To this end Mr. Kentridge ''draws'' on the stage, with electric light used as a draftsman's pen to create elegant graffiti. Examples of solid geometry are diagramed. Doodles move in graceful arcs. Architectural drawings and their specifications appear like wallpaper. Images of palace interiors and waterside exteriors serve as moving scenery. The Queen of the Night is backlighted by a skyful of starry dots.</p>
        <p>In front of all this an opera is going on, and when it starts in earnest, one tends to forget about Mr. Kentridge altogether. Given his very different visual imagination, this South African artist-director has come up with a ''Magic Flute'' of otherwise perplexing conservatism, with hardly a touch to separate it from a hundred other ''Magic Flutes'' put on in the last 200 years.</p>
        <p>And why not, given the quality of the music and the quality of this cast from La Monnaie, the Royal Opera House of Belgium? Let Mozart speak, one can argue. And yet, why, all evening, the nagging feeling of disconnect between original image and boilerplate direction, the sense of distance between singers ''in living color,'' and backgrounds of light and shadow only -- all giving the impression of parallel but distinct worlds. At moments the worlds merged, with players enveloped in light or threatened by swooping showers of sparkle. These moments deeply satisfied.</p>
        <p>I admired the conducting of Piers Maxim, whose swift tempos resisted even the sentimental pull of ''Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schön'' or ''Ach, Ich fühl's.'' Jeremy Ovenden (Tamino) and Sophie Karthäuser (Pamina) were a splendid pair of lovers. Hardly less good were Stephan Loges and Céline Scheen as Papageno and Papagena. Two commanding basses were at work: Kaiser N'Kosi as Sarastro and Zelotes Edmund Toliver as the Speaker. Mr. Kentridge showed his mistrust of Sarastro's political pontifications by accompanying ''In diesen heil'gen Hallen'' with old footage of a white rhino shot to death at close range.</p>
        <p>As the Queen of the Night Milagros Poblador nailed Act II's high notes decisively but was curiously underpowered and unsteady when less voltage was required. Mário Alves was a perfectly acceptable Monostatos.</p>
        <p>As this ''Magic Flute'' worked hard to remind us, the Enlightenment truly believed it could herd the loose ends of humanity into a manageable space, capture the impulsiveness of a Tamino or the unruliness of a Papageno, and comfort both in a place designed by scientists and soothed by art. After Mozart's last note is played and the curtain falls, one feels the ambiguity of such a paradise. Pamina and Tamino face each other and dissolve into colorless silhouettes, frozen against the black-and-white world this director loves so much.</p>
        <p>Performances of ''The Magic Flute'' are scheduled tonight, Friday and Saturday at 7:30 at the Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn; (718) 636-4100 or bam.org.</p>

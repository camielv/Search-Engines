        <p>Re ''Iraq Protesters, Called by Cleric, Say U.S. Must Go'' (front page, April 10):</p>
        <p>With thousands of Iraqis, both Shiite and Sunni, engaging in peaceful protest and supporting democracy, it would seem that they've gotten the point.</p>
        <p>Maybe it is not a question of when Congress or our president will withdraw troops. The Iraqi people should be allowed to practice democracy and determine the amount of time we have left in their country. It may very well be the galvanizing agent needed to bring the country together.</p>
        <p>Americo Paez  Brooklyn, April 10, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Iraqis want us to get our military out of their country. Most American troops want to come home. Most Americans want us to get out of Iraq. Most of the world wants us to get out. Only the Bush White House wants to continue, and even escalate, this war.</p>
        <p>We must have answers to some fundamental questions. Why did the Bush administration invade Iraq, why are we still there, and why does it want to keep our military in Iraq indefinitely?</p>
        <p>Even after four years, we have had no truthful answers to those questions. It's past time that we learned what we are fighting for. Is it only to stabilize what President Bush destabilized?</p>
        <p>Charles F. Wurster  Seattle, April 10, 2007</p>

        <p>The three defendants in the Duke lacrosse sexual assault case and their families arrived in the area late Tuesday in expectation of an announcement from the state attorney general clearing them of all charges, one of the defense lawyers said.</p>

        <p>The three defendants in the Duke lacrosse sexual assault case and their families arrived in the area late Tuesday in expectation of an announcement from the state attorney general clearing them of all charges, one of the defense lawyers said.</p>
        <p>''I am very comfortable with what will happen when the attorney general makes the announcement,'' said Joseph B. Cheshire, a lawyer for David F. Evans, one of three former Duke University students accused of sexual offense and kidnapping in a March 2006 lacrosse team party.</p>
        <p>Another defense lawyer, James P. Cooney III, said the families were arriving so they would not have to travel at the last minute for an announcement. The lawyers declined to say if they had received assurances from the attorney general's office.</p>
        <p>The attorney general, Roy A. Cooper, and his spokeswoman could not be reached Tuesday night. Earlier, the spokeswoman, Noelle Talley, said the office might hold a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Charges are pending against Mr. Evans, 24, of Annapolis, Md.; Reade W. Seligmann, 21, of Essex Fells, N.J.; and Collin Finnerty, 20, of Garden City, N.Y.</p>

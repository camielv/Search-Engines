        <p>OPENING THIS WEEK</p>
        <p>GOLD ST. The Harry's franchise will expand its significant presence in the financial district this week. Tomorrow, Peter Poulakakos, who owns Harry's Cafe and Harry's Steak on Hanover Square with his father, Harry, will open this sleek 24-hour diner and sushi bar with Michael Jewell and Danny McDonald, who are his partners in Ulysses Folk House on Pearl Street. Patrick Vaccariello, the chef at Harry's Cafe and Harry's Steak, will oversee a kitchen that will turn out breakfast items at all hours, including cinnamon bun French toast, and will also serve comfort food like meatloaf and burgers and international items including ramen noodle soup, steamed pork buns and tuna tacos. Desserts will showcase the expertise of the Financier pastry shops nearby, in which Mr. Poulakakos is a partner: 2 Gold Street (Maiden Lane), (212) 747-0797.</p>
        <p>PROVENCE -- Vicki Freeman and Marc Meyer, the new owners, decided to reopen this SoHo pioneer last night, a week early. It had been closed for six months. There have been updates in décor and on the menu, with Lynn McNeely, formerly of Barbuto, in the kitchen: 38 Macdougal Street (Prince Street); (212) 475-7500.</p>
        <p>ZIPPER TAVERN -- What had been Camino Sur, in a former zipper factory, has been converted into an old-New-York-style restaurant and will open on Friday with Garment District nostalgia on the menu: potato pirogis, brisket, baked clams, sausages and lasagna. Larry Kolar is still the chef: 336 West 37th Street, (212) 695-4600.</p>
        <p>MOVING</p>
        <p>SHERRY-LEHMANN  -- After 60 years at 679 Madison Avenue (61st Street), this venerable wine shop will relocate in August to 505 Park Avenue (59th Street): (212) 838-7500.</p>
        <p>CHEFS ON THE MOVE</p>
        <p>HIDEKI NAGATA, left, formerly at Hatsuhana and before that Bouley, is the new executive chef at Caviar Russe in Midtown, where the menu dotes on fish eggs but goes beyond, with a sushi menu and specialties of lobster, smoked fish and duck.</p>
        <p>JASON NERONI has left Porchetta in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, after just a few months.</p>
        <p>DAN CULHANE is now the executive chef at Carne on the Upper West Side.</p>
        <p>OPEN NOW</p>
        <p>ATHENA -- The menu here emphasizes dishes from Cyprus, like chicken with walnut-and-onion bulgur wheat: 33-12 36th Avenue, Astoria, Queens, (718) 729-4945.</p>
        <p>BUDDHA BBEEQ -- This is a minuscule Korean spot for grilled meat dishes, noodles, dumplings and salads: 1750 Second Avenue (91st Street), (212) 348-7041.</p>
        <p>WEST COUNTY GRILL -- Jonathan Waxman and his partners have opened this informal restaurant, with Darren McRonald in the kitchen: 6948 Sebastopol Avenue, Sebastopol, Calif., (707) 829-9500.</p>
        <p>ZEN PALATE -- A financial district branch has opened: 104 John Street (Gold Street), (212) 962-4208.</p>

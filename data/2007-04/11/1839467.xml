        <p>11 P.M. (Bravo) SHEAR GENIUS -- Twelve hairstylists snip and clip their way to a $100,000 prize from the hair products company Nexxus and a chance to show off their technique in Allure magazine in the latest of Bravo's design-based competition series. The überstylist Sally Hershberger, above, who created the Meg Ryan cut and spawned its multitude of imitators, is lead judge with Michael Carl, fashion director of Allure, and Jaclyn Smith, pulling double duty as the show's host. The stylist René Fris, channeling Tim Gunn à la ''Project Runway,'' acts as the salon manager for the contestants -- some of whom will either be ''cut,'' in the words of the panel, or told they ''blow away'' the competition.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (NBC) FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS -- It's game time, boys! The stakes are high as the Dillon Panthers gear up for the state championship in this season finale, leaving the town to speculate whether Coach Taylor (Kyle Chandler, far right) is going to hang around for another round of abuse or pack up for his dream job at Texas Methodist University. Meanwhile, his wife, Tami (Connie Britton), who has told him that she's not going, gets a surprise of her own -- one that took 10 years to materialize.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- Jennifer Lopez performs, and viewers find out whether Sanjaya Malakar and his topknot have survived another week.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13) FAT: WHAT NO ONE IS TELLING YOU -- ''Open abuse of fat people is our last accepted prejudice,'' says Naomi Boak, the executive producer of this two-hour documentary, who, at 5 feet 3 inches and 200 pounds, has been waging a war on fat since childhood. Here she looks at the difficulty that people have in losing weight and also at solutions. Ms. Boak says, ''Being fat is not a moral crime and not just a matter of personal responsibility.'' Meredith Vieira is host.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (CNBC) CONVERSATIONS WITH MICHAEL EISNER -- From Las Vegas, interviews with the newly 60 Elton John; the developer with the dangerous elbow, Steve Wynn; and the illusionist David Copperfield.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Bravo) TOP DESIGN -- In this season finale, Matt Lorenz and Carisa Perez-Fuentes put their touches on identical 1,700-square-foot lofts in downtown Los Angeles for the grand prize of $100,000, a 2007 GMC Acadia and an editorial feature in Elle Decor. Trudie Styler is a guest judge, with Jonathan Adler, Margaret Russell and Kelly Wearstler; Todd Oldham is host.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (NBC) MEDIUM -- Subtitle this one ''brotherly love'': Patricia Arquette's brother David directed this episode, in which Michael (Ryan Hurst), a psychic-hotline worker and the brother of Ms. Arquette's character, Allison, is led to visit a distressed customer in Arizona whose husband has been murdered. And guess who's investigating the case? Right.</p>
        <p>11:35 (NBC) THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO -- Rickie Lee Jones, right, performs music from ''The Sermon on Exposition Boulevard,'' her new devotionally tinged album.</p>

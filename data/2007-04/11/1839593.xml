        <p>The police said yesterday that they had identified a woman whose body was found in a black bag beneath a bridge in Frank S. Hackett Park on Saturday. The woman, whom the police identified as Christie Nelly, 36, of West 29th Street in Bayonne, N.J., died of compression to the neck, a spokeswoman from the medical examiner's office said. Callers identified Ms. Nelly after the police released a sketch of her, the police said. The time of her death was unclear, but a passer-by saw the bag under the Fieldston Road entrance to the Henry Hudson Parkway and called 911 at 9:25 a.m., according to the police. No arrests have been made, and the investigation was continuing.</p>

        <p>SURELY if I put my mind to it I could learn how to shuck oysters without serious damage to myself. But I haven't done so, even though I love them when they are icy cold, filled with the briny flavor of the sea and ready to be slurped out of the shell.</p>
        <p>So when I ordered some Pacific oysters for dinner this past New Year's Eve -- they arrived just one day out of the ocean -- I took the coward's way out: I asked for a jar filled with oysters already shucked. And then I set about finding a way to make cooked oysters as memorable as raw.</p>

        <p>SURELY if I put my mind to it I could learn how to shuck oysters without serious damage to myself. But I haven't done so, even though I love them when they are icy cold, filled with the briny flavor of the sea and ready to be slurped out of the shell.</p>
        <p>So when I ordered some Pacific oysters for dinner this past New Year's Eve -- they arrived just one day out of the ocean -- I took the coward's way out: I asked for a jar filled with oysters already shucked. And then I set about finding a way to make cooked oysters as memorable as raw.</p>
        <p>One recipe -- from Sophie Grigson, an English cookbook author -- caught my attention immediately. Her combination of apples, crème fraîche, lemon and oysters was so unexpected that I tried the recipe before serving it at the party.</p>
        <p>The sweet, firm apples turned out to be the perfect foil for the soft, minerally oyster. The crème fraîche plays the same role as cream or milk in a simple stew. One oyster lightly cooked on top of a baked apple ring and topped with the lemon-flavored crème fraîche is all you need for a memorable appetizer.</p>
        <p>And a comment from a colleague about peas and oysters turned my mind to a pea and arugula soup I had created out of a recipe for puréed peas with watercress. I brought back the watercress and added some Pernod, the oyster's favorite alcoholic beverage, and now have a gorgeous spring green variation on the soup.</p>
        <p>However you cook them, don't shy away from shucked oysters. According to the oysters-''R''-in-season theory, this is the last good month for oysters until September. But today that is less true, thanks to improvements in monitoring at the farms.</p>
        <p>Even so, oysters do have a fuller, richer flavor in the winter, so warmer weather is a good time to serve them cooked.</p>
        <p>BAKED OYSTERS WITH APPLES  Adapted from ''Fish,'' by Sophie Grigson and William Black (Headline, 1998)  Time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>Olive oil for greasing  1 large tart apple, peeled, cored and sliced to give four 1/4-inch-thick rounds  4 large shucked oysters  4 heaping tablespoons crème fraîche, seasoned with a dash of lemon juice  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Grease an ovenproof dish large enough to hold apple slices in a single layer. Arrange slices in dish, and cover with foil. Bake 7 to 10 minutes, until apple slices are softened but still hold their shape.  2. Top each apple round with an oyster. Spoon a tablespoon of crème fraîche over each. Season with salt and pepper. Return to oven for 4 or 5 minutes, until edges begin to bubble. Serve.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>PEA SOUP WITH OYSTERS AND PERNOD  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>6 cups frozen petit pois (tiny peas)  1 bunch watercress, trimmed to 2 to 3 inches long  4 tablespoons olive oil  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  2 tablespoons lemon juice  4 to 6 tablespoons Pernod  16 ounces shucked oysters and liquor.</p>
        <p>1. In a pot, bring enough water to a boil to cover peas. Add peas, and return to a boil. Turn off heat, and add watercress. Cover, and allow to sit for 5 minutes. Drain, reserving liquid.  2. Add half the peas to a food processor with 2 tablespoons olive oil, and process until puréed but still with bits in it. Spoon into a bowl, and set aside. Repeat with the remaining peas and oil.  3. In a pan, combine puréed peas and 2 cups pea cooking water. Season with salt and pepper; add lemon juice and 3 to 5 tablespoons Pernod. If desired, refrigerate.  4. To serve, drain oysters, and add to soup with 1/4 cup oyster liquor. Place soup over medium heat, and cook until edges begin to bubble and liquid is hot and oysters have plumped a little, a couple of minutes. Do not boil. Stir in remaining Pernod; adjust seasonings, and serve.  Yield: 7 cups.</p>

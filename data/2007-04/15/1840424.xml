        <p>IT made Bridgeport an industrial giant nearly a century ago, operating 24 hours a day, employing thousands and creating a mix of neighborhoods on the east side of the city.</p>
        <p>But when General Electric Company closes its plant on Boston Avenue on June 29, most of the 64 employees remaining there will have gone with barely a whimper.</p>
        <p>The half-mile-long, 1.4 million-square-foot complex, consisting of 13 interconnected, five-story buildings on 73 acres, was built by Remington Arms in 1915 to manufacture weapons for World War I.</p>
        <p>''It was one of the biggest factories in the world,'' said Mary K. Witkowski, the city's official historian. ''It was so big, messengers used bicycles and roller skates to go back and forth.''</p>
        <p>The Browning machine gun, which rattled off 250 rounds in 20 seconds -- unheard of at the time -- was made there, as were automatic pistols and bayonets.</p>
        <p>The plant also had its own police force and police station.</p>
        <p>''They were outfitted like soldiers in the regular army,'' Ms. Witkowski said. ''There were a lot of things there that they were trying to keep secret.''</p>
        <p>After many of Remington Arms' contracts with the government ended with the war, General Electric bought the plant in 1921 and made clocks, fans, radios, washing machines and vacuums there.</p>
        <p>An explosion and fire at the factory in 1942 was heard throughout the city and killed several workers and injured about 80 others.</p>
        <p>In the 1950s and '60s, the plant was the scene of a number of large labor strikes. Today, it makes electric switches and the clamps that hold fluorescent bulbs inside light fixtures, said Gus Serra, a spokesman for General Electric.</p>
        <p>In the last year, however, the company lost a customer that accounted for 45 percent of those sales and, Mr. Serra said, the plant was no longer competitive or profitable. He said the building would be used to store company records after production stopped for now, while the company decides what to do with it.</p>
        <p>The company and the State Department of Environmental Protection are conducting an environmental assessment of the plant and the site, Mr. Serra said. ''When that's complete, we'll have a better idea of what our options are,'' he said.</p>
        <p>According to General Electric, the employees were told about the closing in November; about half will retire with full benefits, while the rest will receive a compensation package.</p>
        <p>Ms. Witkowski labeled the plant an icon of Bridgeport's past. ''It's a symbol of what was once the city's industrial wealth,'' she said.</p>

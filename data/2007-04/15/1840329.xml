        <p>They may not rank with the dueling ''Wild Party'' musicals of 2000, but three Off Broadway productions are now competing for the important theater-kitchenware demographic. Already running at New World Stages, ''SEALED FOR FRESHNESS'' uses plastic containers as a metaphor for the hermetic lives of five Midwestern housewives; their lids pop off when the cocktails come out at a Tupperware party. Audiences can share the feeling: a drink called a Tuppertini is sold at the bar. And at select performances ticket holders vie for sandwich holders in a raffle. Through April 29, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com; $65.</p>
        <p>There's no metaphor at ''DIXIE'S TUPPERWARE PARTY,'' starting previews on Wednesday at Ars Nova. Items are really on sale, and Dixie Longate, your hostess, is a real Tupperware top-seller, even if she's a tiny bit fictional. Created by Kris Andersson, Dixie is unapologetic trailer trash: Did you know that the Rectangular Cake Taker makes a handy caddy for 34 Jell-O shots? (Which can serve, she explains, ''two people and one of your kids.'') Despite this, and despite what Dixie does with product No. 426, the Tupperware people have approved the production. Opens May 10 and runs through June 17, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $20 to $25.</p>
        <p>''AMERICAN FIESTA,'' now in previews at the Vineyard Theater, takes a step up the socioeconomic culinary-metaphor scale by offering Fiestaware -- the brightly colored table ceramics beloved of collectors -- as a way of looking at the divide between red and blue states. Written and performed by Steven Tomlinson, the play also concerns divisions within Mr. Tomlinson's own family over his plan to marry his male partner. Watch the crockery fly, or maybe not; a covered onion soup bowl in turquoise can fetch $8,500. Opens April 26 and runs through May 20, 108 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-0303, www.vineyardtheatre.org; $50.</p>

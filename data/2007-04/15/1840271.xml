        <p>Jens mortensen; Courtesy of La Shed Du Fred; courtesy of Laura Davidson Public RelationsFor a superstar hairstylist, Orlando Pita is as modest as a shampoo girl's tips. You won't find him bragging about Madonna, Gwyneth, Tilda and Naomi. And he's way too laid-back to boast about how many fashion shows and ad campaigns he's hot-rollered in the more than 20 years he's been at the top of the game. But there's nothing casual about how he approaches his work. ''I'm a stickler for perfection,'' Pita says, ''although of course, sometimes, perfection can be a perfect mess.'' 2. Between his many photo shoots and runway shows, a consulting gig for L'Oréal and the private clients he coifs at his minimal-chic downtown salon (Orlo, 34 Gansevoort Street; 212-242-3266), Pita rarely lets his hair down. But whenever he can, he and his partner, George Casson, retreat to Cotton House hotel, on the tiny Caribbean island of Mustique. ''My life is so crowded and social that when I get a week off, I prefer remote places.'' Go to www.cottonhouseresort.com. 3. For peace and quiet within driving distance, Pita and Casson shack up in their new country house on the Delaware River in Callicoon, N.Y. ''I love being on the water, and upstate is more me than Long Island,'' he says. The pair frequent the local home-furnishings shop La Shed Du Fred, for gifts, candles, and furniture and accessories by local artisans. Go to www.lasheddufred.com. 4. His most prized haircutting tool -- a vintage feather razor -- was a gift from a close friend. ''I like to use a razor the old-fashioned way, like scissors, to actually cut the hair, not just thin it.'' Similar razors can be found at www.classicshaving.com. 5. Pita's promoting platinum for spring. ''I think bold colors are in, and platinum is the boldest blond you can have,'' he says. ''Obviously, it's not for everyone. You have to be committed.'' Andre Viveiros, Orlo's celebrity colorist, adds, ''Platinum is modern if it's on the cool side, and not too golden.'' The supe du jour, Agyness Deyn, shown here, has the perfect hue. 6. The stylist goes through cases of Kérastase Résistance Double Force hair spray -- $32 at Orlo -- during show season. ''It's a great way to add texture to hair, especially the cropped cut I've been doing lately,'' Pita says. ''I spray it all over in sections and then brush it out. And I always run my fingers through the hair after I spray it.'' 7. His favorite secret address in Paris isn't a trendy boutique or scenester haunt. It's BVH, a department store at 14, rue de Temple, where le sous-sol, the basement hardware and crafts section, is creatively stocked. ''I'll go there two or three times for inspiration during Paris fashion week,'' he says. ''You can find amazing things -- great skins, shoe-mending supplies, chains, laces.'' He used materials he found there to make these hand-cut and hand-lacquered barrettes for John Galliano's fall 2007 Dior runway. 8. His favorite restaurant, Knickerbocker Bar and Grill (33 University Place), isn't exactly teeming with fashion types. ''People don't expect me to like a place like this, but when I take them there, they become instant converts. It's very neighborhood-y, and I'm obsessed with the short ribs.'' 9. As for his own wavy locks? Pita suds up with L'Oréal Vive Pro Nutri Gloss shampoo ($5 at Target). ''It's light but nourishing and leaves my hair really shiny. You don't need to use a lot, and I can even get by without conditioner.'' 10. Orlo clients are smitten with the Bespoke Labs T3 Overnight hair dryer ($130). ''I've never seen a travel dryer this good. It's tiny, folds up, has dual voltage and is as powerful as a full-size model.'' .</p>

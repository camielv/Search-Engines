        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Bringing Back the Sunday Dinner'' (April 1) hit home. I should say the home I once knew.</p>
        <p>Sundays were family visiting days. Either our aunts, uncles, cousins and friends came to our house or we went to theirs. To this day, I get a bittersweet feeling on a Sunday afternoon when I long for those wonderful days of food, laughter and warmth.</p>
        <p>My father died 10 years ago and now I realized he was the glue of the family that has come undone primarily over money. Nevertheless, I strive for that sense of camaraderie and that usually takes the form of going out to dinner just to recreate that Sunday feeling.</p>
        <p>I know I can't bring it back, but it helps to fill the void by trying. Those Sundays were food for the soul, and that remains with us for life.</p>

        <p>Bastien Gonzalez has always been hard to track down, flying from one capital to the next to tend to the toes of the rich and richer. In 2004 he inked an exclusive deal to bring his signature, polish-free, totally buffed medical Pedicure de Bastien to the One and Only resorts -- in Dubai, the Maldives, Mauritius and Los Cabos, Mexico. He spends Sundays in Paris with his girlfriend; infrequent contact ''is why we have so much love,'' he said. This marathon plays out in 18,688 miles traveled per week; 3 passports owned; 10 clients per day; 3,000 pedicures in 2006; 18 pedicurists trained last year; 10 pedicurists fired last year; and 1 buffing chamois used per month. Price for Pedicure de Bastien: $140.</p>

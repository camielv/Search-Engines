      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>This year, the calendar has been generous, offering two loopholes to last-minute federal income tax filers. Not only does April 15 fall on a Sunday, pushing the deadline out one day, but also (who knew?) the District of Columbia is celebrating Emancipation Day on Monday (in honor of when Abraham Lincoln officially ended slavery there). Through a quirk of the law, that means the entire country does not have to file taxes until Tuesday.</p>
        <p>It should be no surprise that the first two weeks of April are the most popular time to mail in returns. The next most popular period is in February, just after W-2's have been sent and people counting on refunds are highly motivated to complete their returns.</p>

        <p>Then there are the extreme lollygaggers, who consider mid-April to be merely the suggested deadline. They may choose to go online at irs.gov and file for a six-month extension, no reason required. But keep one thing in mind, procrastinators: if you file for an extension, the last-minute anguish you avoided in April will only come back to bite you in October.</p>

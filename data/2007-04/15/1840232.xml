        <p>TODAY AND TODAY: Haiku. By Kobayashi Issa. Illustrated by G. Brian Karas. Scholastic Press. $16.99. (Ages 4 to 8) A master of haiku, Issa (born in 1763) wasn't blessed with an ''easy or happy'' life, according to the artist's note at the beginning of this affecting picture book. Karas chose 16 of Issa's plain-spoken poems and arranged them by season. ''Once snows have melted, / the village soon overflows / with friendly children'' reads the first. ''Here / I'm here -- / the snow falling'' reads one of the last. The pictures, in muted tones, may work too hard to supply a story -- images of a hospital and a graveyard tell us the stooped grandfather from the early pages has passed on -- but on the whole they complement the haunting simplicity of Issa's art.</p>
        <p>SKULDUGGERY PLEASANT. By Derek Landy. HarperCollins. $17.99. (Ages 10 and up) A debut that brings a much-needed twist to the mystery/fantasy genre with its wisecracking detective hero, who happens to be a living skeleton (well, not technically living, he admits). A regular Sam Spade, Skulduggery can trade punches with vampires, Cleavers and Faceless Ones while keeping up the banter with his human partner, the ''darkly talented'' Stephanie, whose legacy from a late uncle includes a fortune and otherworldly beings trying to kill her. It's a little hard to buy 12-year-old Stephanie's survival in the face of fangs, oozing tentacles and plain old guns. Still, the author just may have invented a new genre: the screwball fantasy.</p>
        <p>17 THINGS I'M NOT ALLOWED TO DO ANYMORE. By Jenny Offill. Illustrated by Nancy Carpenter. Schwartz &amp; Wade/Random House. $15.99. (Ages 4 to 8) The dynamic design of this picture book complements the over-the-top creativity of its unnamed protagonist. The ''17 things'' she is not allowed to do -- including stapling her brother's hair to his pillow, writing about a beaver for a class project instead of George Washington and showing ''Joey Whipple my underpants'' -- are rendered in energetic pen-and-ink and digital images: young readers will enjoy noticing that the background to the Joey Whipple spread is a rainbow assortment of pastel panties.</p>
        <p>THE ZOO. Written and illustrated by Suzy Lee. Kane/Miller. $15.95. (Ages 3 to 7) In colorful mixed media collage, Lee (who was born in Seoul but now lives in Houston) presents a fanciful visit to a psychedelic zoo where a monkey perches on a smiling hippo and a peacock sports a tail of vivid purple pastel. Unfortunately Mom and Dad are thrown into a panic when their young daughter, in pink cape and boots, wanders after the peacock, imagining herself playing with a bear in a flamingo pool. Clearly it's all in the eye of the beholder. At the end, the girl's ''I love the zoo. It's very exciting'' is comically set against Mom and Dad looking chalk-white with fatigue. Lee's view of the parents is almost depressing -- when they're not panicking, they look bored literally to death -- but the gorgeous menagerie that bursts out at the end restores the child's-eye point of view.</p>
        <p>HEY, YOU! Poems to Skyscrapers, Mosquitoes, and Other Fun Things. Selected by Paul B. Janeczko. Illustrated by Robert Rayevsky. HarperCollins. $15.99. (Ages 7 to 10) A favorite writing exercise here becomes an enjoyable anthology of whimsical poems on every imaginable subject -- snowflakes, soft-boiled eggs, bees, ''hat hair.'' With the exception of Ogden Nash (''Tell me, O Octopus, I begs, / Is those things arms, or is they legs?''), the usual celebrities of American poetry are absent, leaving room for newer pleasures. ''Dear shell: / You curve extremely well. / And when I put you to my curving ear / and hear a whispered wind / far off / I cannot tell but it might be the sea,'' Karla Kuskin writes in ''Dear Shell.'' Keeping in mind her audience, she adds, ''Dear shell: / You also smell.''</p>

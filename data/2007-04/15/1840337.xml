        <p>NO one can be sure exactly what Bach was up to when he wrote the B minor Mass near the end of his life.

        <p>Every realization is speculative to some degree, even if many musicians would prefer not to think so. The members of the Netherlands Bach Society, which dates from 1921 and claims to be the oldest early-music ensemble in the world, experiment as a matter of course. These musicians' latest thoughts on the B minor Mass are captured in a new recording from Channel Classics, and American audiences may hear them on a tour that begins Wednesday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At first hearing, aspects of the society's interpretation strike the ear as markedly old-fashioned, not in itself a bad thing.

        <p>NO one can be sure exactly what Bach was up to when he wrote the B minor Mass near the end of his life. A Roman Catholic Mass by a Lutheran, assembled from movements written over more than two decades, it amounts to a survey of musical possibilities in the liturgy, an encyclopedia as much as a text for actual performance.</p>
        <p>Every realization is speculative to some degree, even if many musicians would prefer not to think so. The members of the Netherlands Bach Society, which dates from 1921 and claims to be the oldest early-music ensemble in the world, experiment as a matter of course. These musicians' latest thoughts on the B minor Mass are captured in a new recording from Channel Classics, and American audiences may hear them on a tour that begins Wednesday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At first hearing, aspects of the society's interpretation strike the ear as markedly old-fashioned, not in itself a bad thing. Tempos are generally moderate rather than extreme; the rhythmic pulse is elastic rather than driven. The immaculate singing, with higher voices trilling like flutes, approximates the playing of instruments, while the instruments express themselves with the spontaneity of song.</p>
        <p>Jos van Veldhoven, the society's artistic director since 1983, strives for this convergence. ''Johann Mattheson, the great Baroque composer and theorist, wrote that to sing you must speak properly, with understanding of the text,'' Mr. van Veldhoven said during a recent visit to New York. ''At the same time he says that you can only play well if you can sing. Song and instrumental music all have the same source.''</p>
        <p>Apart from hearing the choral music sung by soloists, a striking feature of the recording is the majesty of a big church organ at full throttle. The instrument is actually a modern portable, specially designed and built by Jaap Fama, a Dutch specialist in Baroque organs, to convey just this impression.</p>
        <p>''Bach probably used a big organ with lots of stops too,'' Mr. van Veldhoven said. ''It was nothing like the small, portable organs in common use in concert halls today. The full sound and the emotional quality of the harmonies a big organ brings out are fundamental to our ensemble.''</p>
        <p>In line with recent controversial theories on the size of Bach's choruses Mr. van Veldhoven assigns each of the choral lines to a single voice, occasionally adding one or two extra voices per part for poetic emphasis. ''I think of this music not in terms of a chorus,'' Mr. van Veldhoven said, ''but in terms of five highly expressive soloists.''</p>
        <p>Gustav Leonhardt, a pioneer and giant in the early-music field, demurs. ''I think it's nonsense,'' he said recently from his home in Amsterdam. ''We have Bach's own word that his ideal in a four-part choir was 3 persons to a voice, for a total of 12. At one point he writes that 16 would be even better.'' The five-part texture of the B minor Mass should presumably be handled the same way.</p>
        <p>But these are wrangles among close colleagues. ''The Netherlands Bach Society is on the vanguard, I would say,'' Mr. Leonhardt said. ''Mr. van Veldhoven takes note of all the new discoveries and immediately puts them into practice. Of course among musicologists there will always be disagreements.''</p>
        <p>Mr. van Veldhoven invites such dialogue. The Netherlands Bach Society's signature piece has always been ''St. Matthew Passion,'' which it performs every year during Holy Week. To keep the experience fresh not only for himself but also for the players and for audiences, Mr. van Veldhoven maintains a policy of bringing in guest conductors every other year. Often the choices are renowned early-music specialists who have never conducted the work before, as was the case for Ton Koopman and René Jacobs. Performances are held daily through Holy Week in the Grote Kerk (Great Church) of the fortress town of Naarden, outside Amsterdam, beginning at 11 a.m. and ending at 5 p.m. A long intermission leaves time for a picnic on the picturesque city walls.</p>
        <p>Atzo Nicolai, the longtime minister for government reform and kingdom relations, attends every Good Friday -- a working day in the Netherlands -- along with almost a dozen colleagues from the cabinet. '' 'St. Matthew' during Holy Week is bigger in the Netherlands than 'Messiah' at Christmas anywhere else,'' Mr. Nicolai said recently from his office in The Hague. ''I started attending at Naarden as a little boy with my parents. Personally I'm not religious at all. But listening to religious music with your colleagues from the government, you share a lot, something deeper than religion in my view. It's an interesting moment of reflection.''</p>
        <p>The conductor this year was the British harpsichordist, organist and conductor Richard Egarr, a frequent guest of the society, who chose to perform a recently published early version of ''St. Matthew'' rather than the familiar edition. Because of its long history, Mr. Egarr said from his home in Amsterdam, he feels the society is unafraid to look backward as well as forward. ''A lot of performances by early-music ensembles in recent years have gone in for streamlining, making everything faster, more furious, more rigid,'' he said. ''From my point of view that's very undesirable. I started out as a boy chorister at York Minster. My starting point is flexibility, sense of spontaneity.''</p>
        <p>In any case ''authenticity'' is not everything. Mr. van Veldhoven said: ''I'm very interested in facts, but I don't want to be a conservator and do exactly what Bach did. A good performance uses a framework of knowledge. But within that framework there's freedom. So many musicians are trained to think of the composer as God, who had the truth in his pen -- one single truth, and only one. The composer isn't God. He's a friend you can talk to.''</p>

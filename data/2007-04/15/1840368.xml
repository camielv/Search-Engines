        <p>Iavarone Brothers, a 12,000-square-foot specialty market in Wantagh, has all the makings of an Italian feast.</p>

The well-stocked cheese department is paired with an extensive olive bar ($5.99 a pound). Daily specials at the seafood counter include boneless jumbo bacalao or salted cod ($11.99 a pound) and stuffed clams ($1.99 each).

        <p>But it's the prepared foods department that dazzles in its size and scope. The massive central island showcases more than 100 different international specialties, house made and ready for takeout, including stuffed chicken portobello ($4.99 for a half-pound), artichoke and spinach casserole ($3.99 a half-pound) and salmon teriyaki ($7.49 a half-pound).</p>
        <p>Iavarone Brothers has come a long way from its beginnings as a small Italian pork store in Brooklyn in 1927. Back then, Pasquale Iavarone, an immigrant from Naples, became famous for his pork sausages. The original store is now gone, but the family business has grown to include markets in Huntington, Maspeth, New Hyde Park, and the two-year-old Wantagh market, the family's newest and largest store.</p>
        <p>Pasquale's original pork sausages are still made in house ($5.49 a pound). ''If my grandfather could see us now, I think he'd be very proud,'' said Joe Iavarone, a principal owner with his brothers, Pasquale and John.</p>
        <p>Iavarone Brothers, 1166 Wantagh Avenue, Wantagh; (516) 781-6400; www.ibfoods.com. Open Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>

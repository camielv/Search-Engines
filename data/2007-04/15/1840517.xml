        <p>In a cautionary tale that may resonate citywide, residents of 250 Mercer Street, a 277-unit apartment building near Fourth Street, say their efforts to prevent New York University from uprooting 18 mature trees on their block have been undermined by their own co-op board.</p>
        <p>The conflict over preserving the trees -- honey locusts, Japanese lilacs, scholar trees and Callery pears -- stems from the university's proposal to expand a 30-year-old subterranean power plant, which N.Y.U. officials say will reduce emissions and conserve energy, helping the environment. The excavation would require uprooting the trees, which are on public land along the west side of the block and are overseen by the city's Parks Department.</p>

        <p>In a cautionary tale that may resonate citywide, residents of 250 Mercer Street, a 277-unit apartment building near Fourth Street, say their efforts to prevent New York University from uprooting 18 mature trees on their block have been undermined by their own co-op board.</p>
        <p>The conflict over preserving the trees -- honey locusts, Japanese lilacs, scholar trees and Callery pears -- stems from the university's proposal to expand a 30-year-old subterranean power plant, which N.Y.U. officials say will reduce emissions and conserve energy, helping the environment. The excavation would require uprooting the trees, which are on public land along the west side of the block and are overseen by the city's Parks Department.</p>
        <p>The Mercer Street Block Association, whose leaders are co-op owners from 250 Mercer, has been trying to persuade the university to shift construction away from Mercer Street and instead use space under a university courtyard behind Warren Weaver Hall. This move, the group contends, would save the trees, some of which are at least 40 years old and up to five stories tall.</p>
        <p>The same people said they felt sabotaged by an 11th-hour agreement between the university and the co-op board. In the agreement, N.Y.U. agreed to make a payment to the co-op in exchange for the co-op's support of the original plan. The university's community liaison, Alicia Hurley, said the co-op would use the money for improvements to offset the removal of the trees. Neither side would disclose the amount of the payment.</p>
        <p>In the opinion of Shan Reddy, president of the block association, the co-op board acted against the wishes of the residents. ''We had the rug pulled out from under us,'' Mr. Reddy said, ''and as shareholders we are paying for our own rug to be pulled out.''</p>
        <p>Nicholas Walsh, secretary of the co-op board, acknowledged a communication breakdown but said he believed that the university would have proceeded regardless of any deal. ''I felt our avenues of resistance were gone and we should get something while we can,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hurley said that a deal with the co-op board had been agreed on but was not final. She added that details of the agreement were confidential, and noted that the project did not need the co-op board's approval.</p>
        <p>If nothing else, the dispute has galvanized previously uninvolved co-op owners. ''No one ever runs for a spot on the co-op board; they just think it's all about painting the hallways,'' said Robert Schwartzman, co-chairman of the block association. ''Now we're all going to run.''</p>

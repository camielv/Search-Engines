      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The ''gourmet'' in the name seems almost quaint, but in 1979, when Mona Spilo opened Bedford Gourmet across from the single-screen movie theater in Bedford Village, Cuisinart was not yet a household word. The shop is the size of some walk-in closets in town, and on busy days customers looking for a special cheese, or maybe just a bit of conversation, are apt to bump quite literally into somebody they know.</p>
        <p>With daffodils pushing through the grass and woolens relegated to the mothballs, it's time for lunch on the local green. Chicken salad sandwich, check; cold cream soda, check; small bag of potato chips, check; it's the school lunch you always wanted but your mother never packed. At Bedford Gourmet, half sandwiches ($3.95) include ham and brie with Champagne mustard on black bread, and turkey with cranberry mayonnaise on eight-grain bread. An old-fashioned egg salad sandwich on seven-grain bread will set you back $6.95. Mini-baguettes ($3.95) are filled with mozzarella, basil pesto and roasted tomatoes, or prosciutto, provolone and artichoke-lemon pesto. Delicious celery rémoulade, so much better than coleslaw, is $9.95 per pound.</p>

        <p>If a paper bag is just too plain, buy a slatted basket ($30) and fill it with little extras: a bundle of pink and green Caspari napkins, a slim baguette, cipolline onions steeped in balsamic vinegar, a few slices of Fra'Mani salame, a local ''Little Bloom'' goat cheese or a jar of Killer Bee Honey from Tom Cohn's industrious Bedford bees.</p>
        <p>The shelves abound with sweets. A one-pound tin of red and black licorice piglets is $12.95 and will last you a month. Tate's butterscotch pecan cookies, stacked in crisp cellophane, are $5.95 a dozen. Petit fours iced with ribbons and daisies are $2.50 each.</p>

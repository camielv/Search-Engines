        <p>THE passage of time has dulled the historical stature of Sleepy Hollow's inimitable raconteur, Washington Irving, who was a world-renowned celebrity in his day.

        <p>THE passage of time has dulled the historical stature of Sleepy Hollow's inimitable raconteur, Washington Irving, who was a world-renowned celebrity in his day. Known today as the author of ''Rip Van Winkle'' and ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,'' he was also an lawyer and statesman who traveled the world and knew eight presidents during his lifetime in the years between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Andrew Burstein, a historian and alumnus of the Hackley School in nearby Tarrytown, is going to Irving's homestead, Sunnyside, in Sleepy Hollow to read from his new biography, ''The Original Knickerbocker: The Life of Washington Irving'' (Basic Books, 2007), which aims to capture the role he played in politics and culture through a 21st-century perspective.</p>
        <p>''What drew me to Irving was my own nostalgia for the Tarrytown I knew as a teenager,'' said Mr. Burstein, a Thomas Jefferson scholar and professor of 19th-century United States history at the University of Tulsa. ''Irving was a giant in the 19th century, and that has been displaced. I wanted to recover him as a dynamic historic actor.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burstein, 54, lived in Westchester and New Jersey as a child and discovered Sleepy Hollow in his teens -- as did Irving, who was sent away from his childhood home in the financial district in Manhattan to bucolic Sleepy Hollow as a teenager to escape a yellow fever epidemic.</p>
        <p>That formative time in Irving's life, when he first explored the old Dutch settlements in the area, shaped much of his later writing and inspired a legacy of stories and movies based on his archetypal American folk tales.</p>
        <p>Apparently the area also had a profound effect on Mr. Burstein, who dedicated his new book to the Hackley School, where he will be speaking on Monday night and Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burstein will also speak at a public gathering at Sunnyside at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.</p>

        <p>Re ''What Consultants May Not Know About Leadership,'' William J. Holstein's review of ''True North'' by Bill George (Off the Shelf, April 1):</p>
        <p>While I largely agree with the review -- and even with the idea that much of what is written and taught on the topic is likely worthless -- it misses a broader point about the leadership development field.</p>
        <p>Many authors and consultants know what Mr. George knows, and have found ways to make this abundantly available in leadership development programs. We know, for example, that leadership development is most successful when it consists of showing people how their values, experiences and behaviors shape their leadership styles and effectiveness.</p>
        <p>If we are to create the new leadership essential to success in the 21st century, we probably should do more of what Mr. George suggests, and keep doing what authors and consultants have been showing us how to do for many decades.</p>
        <p>Chuck McVinney  Brookline, Mass., April 2</p>
        <p>The writer is a leadership development consultant.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I agree that much money spent on leadership development has been wasted.</p>
        <p>As an organizational psychologist, I have asked dozens of C.E.O.'s to what extent they attribute reaching their executive level, even in small part, to a leadership development program. None of them, alone or in a group, attributed their success to participation in such programs.</p>
        <p>All, however, said that their careers got a jump-start after somebody gave them an opportunity, encouraging them to take responsibility for a task for which they were not qualified by experience or prior knowledge.</p>
        <p>The critical leadership characteristics of good judgment and the willingness to take risks are not the kind of thing one acquires from a leadership development program.</p>
        <p>Melvin Sorcher, Ph.D.  Westport, Conn., April 1</p>

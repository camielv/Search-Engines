        <p>Enough ink has been spilled on this week's politically minded PBS documentary series, ''America at a Crossroads,'' to choke a donkey and an elephant. Less has been said about the Sundance Channel's new environmental set of programs, perhaps because it bears the unfortunate title ''The Green.'' It kicks off this week too, with the premiere of the newsmagazine series ''BIG IDEAS FOR A SMALL PLANET'' and the documentary ''A CRUDE AWAKENING: THE OIL CRASH'' (both Tuesday).</p>
        <p>In the six-episode first season of the popular British series ''WILD AT HEART'' (BBC America, Saturday), a Cotswolds vet takes his fractious blended family to South Africa on a mission to return a smuggled monkey to the wild and perhaps find some household harmony along the way: ''All Creatures Great and Small'' meets ''Yours, Mine and Ours'' meets ''Daktari.'' Noncynical American families, or animal lovers, who enjoy the show will be pleased to know that the ITV network recently ordered a third season.</p>
        <p>Paper, pasta, gunpowder, fireworks -- and flowers? The ''Nova'' episode ''FIRST FLOWER'' (PBS, Tuesday) traces the efforts of botanists and geneticists to determine whether China was the birthplace not just of spaghetti and Roman candles but of the first blossoming plant as well. Don't get your hopes too high for a definitive answer, but in the meantime enjoy the absolutely gorgeous scenes shot in the Hengduan Mountains, which are indisputably the home of any number of plants we treasure, including lilies, irises, camellias, primrose and rhododendrons. They can be seen here in wild and riotously colorful forms unknown to the rest of the world. It's what HD was made for.</p>

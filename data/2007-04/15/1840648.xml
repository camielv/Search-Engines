        <p>Some were wounded by would-be assassins, others hospitalized with diseases or broken bones. The list of governors who have been sidelined is long. But more often than not, their time off the job was not.</p>
        <p>''There's not a lot of precedent for governors being taken out of office for being incapacitated,'' said Christopher Cashman, a spokesman for the National Governors Association.</p>
        <p>New Jersey governors seem especially prone to hospital stays.</p>
        <p>For several weeks in 1982, Thomas H. Kean ran state government from a hospital room in Livingston, where he was undergoing treatment for a ruptured spinal disk. Govs. Christie Whitman and James E. McGreevey each broke a leg. (So, last year, did Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California.)</p>
        <p>Compared with Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, who was critically injured in a traffic accident on Thursday, 15 months after taking office, many of the other governors were far along in their tenures when they were stricken.</p>
        <p>Ella T. Grasso of Connecticut, the first woman elected governor of any state who did not succeed her husband, had a diagnosis of ovarian cancer in March 1980, halfway through her second term, announced her resignation the following December and died two months later.</p>
        <p>In 1972, Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama was shot while campaigning for president in Maryland. Because he was out of state for more than 20 days recovering in a Maryland hospital, the lieutenant governor filled in for a month until Mr. Wallace returned to Alabama.</p>
        <p>Some suffered quietly and heroically, like Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York, who was stricken with polio in 1921 and was elected governor seven years later. (The state built a warm water pool for him behind the Executive Mansion in Albany in 1929 so he could exercise his crippled legs.)</p>
        <p>In 1993, before undergoing a heart and liver transplant, Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania transferred authority to his lieutenant governor. It was the first time an acting governor ran the state. Mr. Casey, who was 61, resumed his duties six months later after being hospitalized two more times.</p>
        <p>''I came back because it was my duty to come back,'' he declared. ''I was re-elected in 1990 by the people of this state to serve a four-year term, and that, with the help of God and our people, is what I intend to do.'' He did.</p>
        <p>In 2003, Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon of Indiana was in his second term when he suffered a stroke while attending a trade conference in Chicago. When the 73-year-old governor died a week later, he was succeeded by the lieutenant governor, a political ally.</p>
        <p>In 1994, Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois had quadruple bypass surgery, but was released from the hospital in less than two weeks and plunged into a re-election campaign, which he won.</p>
        <p>In 2001, Jane M. Swift gave birth to twins a month after inheriting the governorship of Massachusetts from Paul Cellucci, who was named ambassador to Canada. She took what she called a ''working maternity leave,'' running the state by speakerphone.</p>
        <p>The following year, pummeled by dismal poll numbers, she dropped her re-election campaign even before the Republican primary.</p>
        <p>In 2006, in his 12th and last year as governor, George E. Pataki of New York spent 18 days in the hospital after his appendix burst.</p>
        <p>His lieutenant governor, Mary O. Donohue, had been so invisible in Albany that when Mr. Pataki underwent the first of two operations, his staff did not inform her until after the surgery -- and her brief tenure -- was over.</p>

        <p>''I use Nivea. I swear by Nivea!'' Kitty Carlisle Hart exclaims. ''I was furious that they wouldn't let me be the Nivea girl.'' Hart, who danced with Cole Porter, sang with Irving Berlin and told jokes in between takes with the Marx Brothers, usually gets what she wants. She became the toast of the town in 1946, when she married the playwright Moss Hart, and today, at 96, having just finished a sold-out run at Feinstein's at the Regency, she remains her glamorous, imperturbable self. ''I'm lucky,'' she says. ''My left profile is very good-looking, and my right profile is very good-looking.'' Ba-dum-bum! That doesn't mean she spends no time preparing for a performance. ''I have to do a lot of stuff,'' she says. ''I have to put on foundation, which I never wear. And eyebrows. And mascara.'' Thanks to an old movie-star friend, she doesn't overdo it: ''Once Jeanette MacDonald called me, and she said, 'You're not doing your lips right. Too much lipstick.' '' Offstage, she never washes her face with soap, and her makeup takes all of 10 minutes. ''Pink cheeks. Hairdo. And very red lips.'' And she can't remember a day without Nivea. ''The best thing,'' she says, she's ever put on her face. (Send check in care of Hart.)</p>

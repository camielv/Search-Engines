        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I disagree with Caroline Weber's assessment, in her review of ''Nancy Cunard,'' by Lois Gordon (April 1), that Cunard was a ''supporter of the disenfranchised.'' Weber failed to point out that Henry Crowder, the African-American jazz pianist she fell in love with and lived with, was a married man. There is nothing worthwhile when a white woman takes a good man away from a ''sister.'' Nancy Cunard had plenty of pickings and her choice of Crowder was cruel and thoughtless.</p>

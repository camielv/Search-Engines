        <p>Lenka Rubenstein letter on Evan Rail's March 25 travel article on Prague, Czech Republic</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor: In ''36 Hours; Prague'' (March 25), Evan Rail repeatedly refers to the city and its inhabitants as ''Eastern European,'' which makes me want to point out that Vienna is to the east of Prague, yet hardly anyone would think of ranking Austrians among the Eastern Europeans.</p>
        <p>True, during the Communist regime, the Czech Republic, then Czechoslovakia, was part of the so-called Eastern Bloc -- part of the Warsaw Treaty indeed -- but both Czechoslovakia and the Warsaw Treaty are now, of course, a thing of the past. The Eastern Bloc term defined a political division that is no longer valid because Europe is becoming one. Most European countries, including those beyond the Czech Republic's eastern border, are now members of the European Union.</p>

        <p>Geographically, the Czech Republic is smack in the middle of Europe; it could even be considered Central Europe. Calling Czechs Eastern European'' in the current political climate sounds rather derogatory, as it would no doubt sound to Austrians. After all, Berlin's longitude is nearly the same as Prague's, and no one calls Berliners ''East Germans'' today, right?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am personally devastated to learn that the ''Hallelujah'' chorus was written to celebrate the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. As a professional oboist taking part for 55 years in annual performances at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, I was also spiritually moved by this great work. However, if I knew then what I have just learned, I would never have accepted those performances. Blatant anti-Semitism should have no place in music.</p>

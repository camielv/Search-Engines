        <p>Albany's failure to approve long overdue pay increases for members of the state's judiciary was among the major disappointments of this year's budget season. Last week, New York State's chief judge, Judith Kaye, expressed her frustration, saying she may bring a lawsuit if the logjam over judicial pay persists past the close of the current legislative session.</p>
        <p>Judge Kaye's complaint is worth paying attention to because no one has done more than she has to improve the state's courts.</p>
        <p>On a positive note, though, the new state budget includes $8 million in new funding for critical civil legal services for poor people -- a notable advance for New York's justice system that more than doubled last year's budget total.</p>
        <p>In a further breakthrough, the increase in funding is supported by a general budget appropriation. This represents a healthy break from the debilitating pattern of supporting civil legal services largely through ad hoc member items controlled by individual lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Ample credit for this progress is due Judge Kaye and Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who showed their commitment to improving access to justice by including funding for civil legal services in their respective budget proposals. And in refreshing contrast to his predecessor, former Gov. George Pataki, Mr. Spitzer did not simply leave it to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Assembly judiciary chair Helene Weinstein, and other concerned lawmakers to carry the ball on the issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer's willingness to exert gubernatorial leadership helped insure that expanded funding to address the basic legal needs of the poor in areas like housing, child support, and spousal and elderly abuse was not lost in the contentious wrangling so common to Albany over other issues like health care and education.</p>
        <p>Details of how the legal services money will be distributed around the state must still be worked out. But by any reasonable formula, legal services providers in New York City, where the need is especially acute, should receive a sizeable share.</p>
        <p>Of the 2.5 million people living in poverty in the state, 1.8 million live in the city, according to census figures. A report by the Brennan Center for Justice found that an overwhelming number of poor seniors facing eviction in proceedings in the city's Housing Court lack any legal representation.</p>
        <p>New York still has a long way to go to bring its funding of essential legal services up to the level of some other states. The contributions of lawyers who provide pro bono legal services remain essential. But with the new budget, the state has at least begun to match their commitment.</p>

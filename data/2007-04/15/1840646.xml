        <p>Officials warned New York-area residents to be prepared today for what meteorologists and emergency planners are saying could be the worst storm since 1992.</p>
        <p>Emergency officials and forecasters said they expected it to hit the region this morning with sustained winds of up to 35 miles per hour and gusts of up to 50 m.p.h. The storm could continue through tomorrow in some parts of the area.</p>
        <p>The storm has left a trail of snow, thunderstorms and at least one tornado as it has moved from the Midwest toward New England.</p>
        <p>In the New York area, heavy rains are expected. Officials are worried that the combination of high winds and high tides could cause coastal flooding. ''Let us hope it doesn't happen, but we have to prepare for the worst while we're hoping for the best,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference yesterday.</p>
        <p>The mayor said evacuations were unlikely, but in a cautionary move, city emergency planners have identified possible shelters in the highest-risk areas and have alerted hospitals and nursing homes there to be prepared to relocate patients and elderly residents in the event of severe flooding.</p>
        <p>City officials have mapped out several areas most at risk for flooding, including the Financial District, Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and the Lower East Side in Manhattan; Coney Island and Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn; and the Rockaways in Queens.</p>
        <p>Michael A. Balboni, the state's deputy secretary for public safety, said he had asked Nassau and Suffolk County officials to prepare for the type of flooding they saw in 1992.</p>
        <p>''We haven't had a system like this in several years, dating back, I think, to 1992,'' said Ross Dickman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Eastern Region.</p>
        <p>The December 1992 northeaster, which was blamed for six deaths, ravaged swaths of the region with hurricane-force winds (74 m.p.h. and higher), rain and snow.</p>
        <p>While there is still a chance that the brunt of the storm could miss the city, Mayor Bloomberg warned residents to stay off roads and have extra batteries for radios and flashlights in case of power failures. He also cautioned residents to have plenty of food on hand and an emergency kit so that they don't have to go outside during the storm.</p>
        <p>City workers fanned out yesterday to clear catch basins on flood-prone roads. The mayor said that elite fire and police units would be ready to make water rescues.</p>

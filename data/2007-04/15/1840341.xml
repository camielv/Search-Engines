      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor: Like Fred and Ellen Bishko, who described their Edward Albee-inspired trip in their recent letter to the editor (March 11), my husband and I also went to Easter Island after reading Mr. Albee's rave travelogue, ''The Dream at the End of the World'' (April 30, 2006). Never has a trip so exceeded expectations.</p>
        <p>The statues were awesome, exactly as Mr. Albee described them, but what he never mentioned was the ravishing beauty and the incredibly mellow vibe of Easter Island.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Like Fred and Ellen Bishko, who described their Edward Albee-inspired trip in their recent letter to the editor (March 11), my husband and I also went to Easter Island after reading Mr. Albee's rave travelogue, ''The Dream at the End of the World'' (April 30, 2006).

        <p>The statues were awesome, exactly as Mr. Albee described them, but what he never mentioned was the ravishing beauty and the incredibly mellow vibe of Easter Island.</p>
        <p>Happily on our own in a little red jeep, we quickly figured out how to miss the crowds and saw all the sights in splendid isolation. We hiked along the gorgeous coast, had lunch and hung out at the beach every day and returned to our favorite places at various times of the day.</p>
        <p>In the evening (sunset was after 9 p.m.), we'd walk into picturesque Hanga Roa, watch the local kids surfing in the harbor and eat delicious seafood at lovely casual restaurants.</p>
        <p>We stayed five days as suggested by Mr. Albee. Next time, we'll go for seven.</p>

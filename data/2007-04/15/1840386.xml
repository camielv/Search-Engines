        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While Michael Marissen's article provided challenging food for thought, the decision to run it on Easter morning, the holiest day of the Christian year, was unfortunate. I was saddened but curious to see Mr. Marissen debunk the theory -- which I had been taught in grad school -- that Handel's Old Testament oratorios were patronized by a largely Jewish audience. I wonder, however, in the absence of hard facts, who is served by this information? If the origins of ''Messiah'' are indeed anti-Semitic, it seems safe to say that it has successfully outlived them.</p>

        <p>The week's big religious story was that of the fabrication of the figure of a crucified Christ in chocolate. I thought that (along with the conservative Christian reaction) was funny. The publication of Mr. Marissen's article on Easter Sunday is far more pernicious.</p>

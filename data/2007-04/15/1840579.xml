        <p>Re ''Packing for the Ineffable'' (Op-Ed, April 11):</p>
        <p>Valerie Seiling Jacobs's heart-rending reflection on the packing and departure of her stepson for a tour in Iraq was at once rich in the details of packing rites and expansive toward the human feelings implied by these actions.</p>
        <p>Any parent of a loved child on the brink of a journey feels the bittersweet conflict of wanting him to succeed and wanting him to carry a piece of home with him. But this is not so much a journey as a terrifying step into the morass of war.</p>
        <p>A talisman to keep him safe from harm and connected to the heart is the symbolic presence of kith and kin with him at each step. Thank you.</p>
        <p>Leslie Goodwin  Hicksville, N.Y., April 11, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Valerie Seiling Jacobs left me crying into my morning coffee.</p>
        <p>In November, Americans registered strong opposition to the continued killing and maiming of our troops in the interests of a misguided Iraq strategy. In return, what we're getting from our leaders is an adolescent game of ''chicken'' over the war spending bill, with the ever-smirking president in the role of playground bully.</p>
        <p>This, while soldiers and their families are left to deal with the ruination of their lives. At the very least, President Bush should have the decency to swear off smirking until our troops come home.</p>
        <p>Candice Sherman  New York, April 11, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>After reading ''Packing for the Ineffable,'' I went in search of a book for my son to take with him when he deploys to Iraq in July. Like Valerie Seiling Jacobs, I am anxious about not only the actual day he leaves, but also the 15 months that follow.</p>
        <p>How will I handle the relentless media coverage, most of it negative, and the sense of worry that accompanies the dawn of each day?</p>
        <p>But the ineffable is just that. My son has chosen this path to adulthood, and it is neither straight nor narrow. We -- his father, three siblings and I -- have no choice but to support him.</p>
        <p>If this is what it takes for my son, who just last year was a straight-A student completing his sophomore year in college, to feel challenged and alive and that his life is meaningful and worthwhile, so be it.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, we will anxiously but optimistically await his safe return.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>What do you give a loved one who is off to serve his or her country in times of war?</p>
        <p>In World War II, my parents gave me nothing tangible, nothing to be jammed into a G.I. bag, merely their promise of undying love and the certain knowledge -- no need for it to be spoken -- that no matter the condition in which I might return, they would be there for me.</p>
        <p>Even in this day of tiny, transportable electronic gadgetry, what soldier, sailor or marine truly wishes for more?</p>

        <p>''The starting point was to rethink the shirt,'' says Baruc Corazón, the soft-spoken designer of the Baruc shirt. In a corner overlooking touristy Madrid's Plaza Mayor, Mr. Corazón's showroom has no sign at street level, nothing to indicate what awaits five floors above. Plenty have found it: from members of the Spanish royal family to flamenco singers.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, the space is tiny. Shirts are on metal rolling racks. Blown-up photographs of friends and family wearing the shirt grace the walls. (Below, a pin cushion.)</p>
        <p>''My shirts adhere to five principles,'' says Mr. Corazón, who gave up writing a fashion column for El Mundo when his shirts became popular (he is still the host of an art program on television). ''One, every season; two, every gender -- the same cut for men and women; three, every age -- from two years to whenever; four, self-sufficient -- they are completely washable; and five, every size -- from XXS to XXL.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corazón has taken the basic men's button-down and reconsidered everything about it. Encouraging wearers to eschew ties, the shirt is collarless, but it is higher, and more comfortable, than a Mao design. The cuffs can be buttoned or, ingeniously, the button can tuck inside to make room for cuff links. The front buttons are covered by a double-stitched placket. The shape is slimming but not confining; relaxed, and yet formal. The shirts are sold at the most expensive shops in Madrid, as well as by appointment at the showroom. Prices begin at 120 euros, or about $165 at $1.36 to the euro.</p>
        <p>In the full collection on display above Plaza Mayor, the basic shirt has three cousins. There are the slightly longer over-all; the kurta, based on the South Asian shirt of the same name -- but slimmer -- with pockets and wearable as a dress; and finally, the caftan, a distant, more flattering version of what you bought in Morocco. Each piece comes in a colorful array of Italian silks, linens, heavy cottons and poplins. There are also pajamas, polos and American-cut blazers in luscious heavy cotton, linen and seersucker as well as a small hand-knit collection.</p>
        <p>''The shirt,'' says Mr. Corazón, ''is the basic clothing of humanity.''</p>

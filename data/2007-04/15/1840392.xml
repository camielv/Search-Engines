        <p>The stretch of Post Road inhabited by Fuji Mart bears as much resemblance to Tokyo's Ginza district as a chopstick does to a living tree. Yet once you step into this tiny shop, within a mirrored-glass cube building, you'll feel as if you've been transported to Japan.</p>
        <p>Japanese appears on most of the products, with English translations on adhesive labels, like the subtitles of a foreign movie. Shelves along the three aisles brim with Asian staples. Among many types of tea are the ubiquitous green, oolong and jasmine ($1.49 for a 16-bag box). Rice vinegars and soys sit beside unagi sauce ($2.49 per 250-gram bottle), used to lacquer eel. There are more pouches of seaweed than you could shake an octopus at, including hijiki ($3.99 for 3.5 ounces), wakame and nori (10 sheets for $3.49). Near the dried noodles is a potpourri of snacks, with rice and seaweed crackers (from $1.29 to $3.49) next to dried octopus tentacles and pepper-spiked squid ($4.99 a pack).</p>

        <p>The fresh produce includes enoki mushrooms ($1.49 for 200 grams) and shiso leaves ($1.35 for 10), along with bean sprouts, a dozen types of tofu, baby eggplant, and a wide variety of pickles, including radish and plum ($1.79 to $2.69). In the freezer are thinly sliced sukiyaki beef ($12.99 a pound), pork and chicken, and burdock root ($2.29 per 500 grams). Your family sushi chef will want to try the fresh tuna, salmon, yellowtail and octopus (all at $19.99 a pound), as well as sea urchin, fresh quail eggs (10 for $1.99) and salmon roe. No in-home chef? No problem: Freshly-made California rolls ($4.99 for nine pieces) are also available.</p>

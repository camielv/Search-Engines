        <p>THEY crowded into a ground-floor auditorium in Lower Manhattan on Wednesday morning, about 70 people who were in favor of a plan for new housing for low-income residents and the formerly homeless in Park Slope, and 25 people who opposed it. Their vociferous testimony at a hearing of the City Planning Commission lasted well into the afternoon.</p>
        <p>The proposed housing now wending its way through the public review process has drawn both mounting ire and growing support in recent weeks, although it has been in the planning stages since 2005. It was that year that the city determined that a 25-car municipal parking lot at Fifth Avenue and 16th Street in Brooklyn was not well used and that the property should be put to a more productive use.</p>

        <p>THEY crowded into a ground-floor auditorium in Lower Manhattan on Wednesday morning, about 70 people who were in favor of a plan for new housing for low-income residents and the formerly homeless in Park Slope, and 25 people who opposed it. Their vociferous testimony at a hearing of the City Planning Commission lasted well into the afternoon.</p>
        <p>The proposed housing now wending its way through the public review process has drawn both mounting ire and growing support in recent weeks, although it has been in the planning stages since 2005. It was that year that the city determined that a 25-car municipal parking lot at Fifth Avenue and 16th Street in Brooklyn was not well used and that the property should be put to a more productive use.</p>
        <p>The lot was turned over to the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which determined that the site was appropriate for what is called supportive housing -- housing that is priced to be affordable to people in need and that includes social services on the premises. The Fifth Avenue Committee, a community group that has sponsored similar projects in the past, was asked to serve as the developer.</p>
        <p>Now, the proposal has been firmed up: a five-story building containing 49 studio apartments and stores, expected to open late next year. Sixty percent of the tenants would be mentally ill people referred from the city's shelter system, and the rest would be low-income residents of the community. Preference for apartments would be given to the elderly and young people who are getting too old to be placed in foster care.</p>
        <p>A small group of neighbors who became aware of the plan only recently have been outspoken in their opposition, saying that the single-room-occupancy residents may pose a danger, especially to their children, and cause property values to drop.</p>
        <p>''There's a potential risk when you have a 49-room S.R.O. that does not truly have the support services required for people with these issues,'' said Matthew Dwyer, an engineer and father of three. He lives next to the proposed residence and is a co-founder of a group called 16th Street Action, created in response to the project.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of consideration for these people,'' Mr. Dwyer said, ''and we feel like there should also be consideration for middle-class people who have children and work very hard for a little piece of property in this expensive city.''</p>
        <p>According to Michelle de la Uz, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee, social services will be offered at the building five days a week, along with additional 24-hour phone support, 24-hour front desk security and a live-in superintendent. An extensive screening for potential tenants will include psychiatric evaluations, reviews of their housing histories and criminal background checks, she added, and they will have to have incomes of under $30,000.</p>
        <p>''A handful of people are unfortunately misinformed,'' Ms. de la Uz said of the neighborhood opponents. ''They have some very legitimate questions and concerns, which we have answered. But a lot of their fears are based on a misunderstanding of who the tenant population will be.''</p>

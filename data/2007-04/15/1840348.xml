        <p>Sometimes it takes a sense of history to come up with a futuristic design. When the New York architects Tsao &amp; McKown were asked to design a case for Shu Uemura's Rouge Unlimited lipstick -- which has 17 vivid new shades for spring -- they found inspiration in the company's original clear refills. Calvin Tsao explains, ''We always thought the transparency was important, but thought, Let's make that the packaging.'' Changing the case from one meant to be thrown away to one meant to be shown off wasn't easy: eliminating the lipstick's metal pan (which would have shown through the plastic) took a year, during which time, Tsao notes, ''We built a 15-story building.''</p>

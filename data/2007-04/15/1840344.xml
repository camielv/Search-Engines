        <p>When they're not blogging incessantly about their expanding bump on MommyBuzz.com, they're exposing it for all the world to see. The bovinely pregnant are now demanding the full Demi Moore treatment, in what is quickly becoming a seventh-month rite of passage. Usually shot in black and white and occasionally joined by partners, pets and even surrogates, the pregnant nude is keeping studio photographers busy on both coasts. The photographer Rachel Jeraffi in Los Angeles charges upward of $675 a session, and Jennifer Loomis, who operates out of New York, Seattle, San Francisco and Atlanta, reports a huge ''bump'' in business. What's next? The miracle of birth on YouTube? Jennifer Loomis is at www.jenniferloomis.com, and Rachel Jeraffi is at www.pregnancyportraits.net.</p>

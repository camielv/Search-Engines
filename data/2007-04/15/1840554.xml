        <p>Can the actress Salma Hayek help Hollywood figure out how to give a Latino lilt to mainstream entertainment? She has done it successfully with ''Ugly Betty,'' the Colombian telenovela reshaped for an American audience into the hit ABC show, for which she is executive producer.</p>
        <p>Now, she is teaming up with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which is slowly building new divisions and relationships to fill its distribution pipeline, to accomplish the same goal. The production company, called Ventanazul and half-owned by each party, will focus on making movies that have Latino themes but appeal to mass audiences. Ms. Hayek will be chief executive.</p>

The production company, called Ventanazul and half-owned by each party, will focus on making movies that have Latino themes but appeal to mass audiences. Ms. Hayek will be chief executive.</p>
        <p>Hollywood has had little success so far in appealing to the large and growing Latino audience in the United States, with flops like Fox's 2003 effort, ''Chasing Papi.''</p>
        <p>''We want these movies to appeal to everyone, but we also hope to make Latino audiences proud,'' Ms. Hayek said.</p>

        <p>GREED</p>
        <p>By Elfriede Jelinek.</p>
        <p>Translated by Martin Chalmers.</p>
        <p>330 pp. Seven Stories Press. $24.95.</p>
        <p>When Elfriede Jelinek was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2004, the response of the international press and literary world was wildly mixed. Many commentators were surprised and puzzled (''who?''); others expressed shock and outrage; a few gave their enthusiastic endorsement. One member of the Swedish Academy resigned in protest. The predominant tone was one of cautious approval.</p>
        <p>Much of the controversy had to do with Jelinek's politics. She had been a member of the Austrian Communist Party from 1974 to 1991, was a fierce critic of her country's middle class and the American war in Iraq, and espoused an extreme form of feminism based on the conviction that, under male hegemony, heterosexual relations are inherently violent and that women are scripted for self-extinction.</p>
        <p>In the English-speaking countries, Jelinek's work is still relatively unknown, even though four of her novels have long been available in translation, all of them issued by a small British publisher, Serpent's Tail Press. Now Seven Stories is coming out with ''Greed,'' Jelinek's 10th and most recent novel. The German edition was published in 2000, so it formed part of the oeuvre for which its author was honored by the Swedish Academy.</p>
        <p>''Do you have the talent to be happy? Then on no account waste it here!'' Had these been the opening sentences of this grim and dyspeptic novel, they might have served as fair warning to the reader, or perhaps as a challenge: ''Enter this enchanted wood, ye who dare!'' But they appear on Page 62.</p>
        <p>Elfriede Jelinek is not solicitous of her readers. The book's German subtitle, ''Ein Unterhaltungsroman'' -- meaning a light, entertaining novel -- was evidently intended to mislead those who would be misled by frivolous expectations. Nor is it by any stretch a ''thriller,'' as the American edition's dust jacket would have it: considerable rhetorical skills have been employed to nip any possible suspense in the bud. No one's pleasure will be spoiled if I give away the plot.</p>
        <p>A country policeman named Kurt Janisch (blond, athletic, with a chronically erect penis) flags down a delinquent female motorist (cultivated, attractive, middle-aged) named Gerti, more often referred to as ''the woman.'' They become lovers -- or so Gerti chooses to imagine, despite the increasingly brutal copulation that defines their relationship.</p>
        <p>Kurt is married and a repressed homosexual, but the woman is single and hopes to make him her husband. He, in turn, finding himself in debt, manipulates her to sign over to him the deed to her house. That done, Gerti becomes a nuisance to Kurt. For relief he seduces a 16-year-old girl named Gabi whom he then, casually and without apparent motive, murders and deposits in an Alpine lake.</p>
        <p>The body is found, but the killer, who is part of the search team, is not. In the end, the mortally disillusioned woman puts herself to sleep with a poison originally prescribed by a veterinarian for an epileptic dog. There is a subplot as well: the policeman's son and his wife are themselves poised to murder an alcoholic old woman whose house will become theirs as soon as her useless presence is out of the way.</p>
        <p>That sounds like a page turner. Now I too have misled you. Nothing is farther from Jelinek's mind than advancing a plot or even just telling a story. Her business is social dissection. Not vivisection, for none of her specimens are alive. To be alive -- or to seem so -- a person must exhibit at least the appearance of autonomy, and none of Jelinek's characters have enough consciousness to surprise themselves or the reader in the least.</p>
        <p>Jelinek herself has said that the characters in ''Greed'' are ''marionettes of their social conditions.'' But who, in a novel, pulls the strings? Surely it is the author. And because this author is much more interested in ''social conditions'' than in people, she often hangs her marionettes on a hook, the better to rage against the tyranny of sex and the fatal lure of the myth of romantic love for women who deem themselves emancipated (''Silly cows, women. All of them. Above all, the educated ones''), and to expatiate on the many evils and annoyances that can be laid at the doorstep of patriarchal capitalism in general or its Austrian variety in particular. There is a kind of mirthless humor in these diatribes. They are too bitter to really amuse, and too slight to accomplish much in the way of satire. And they tend to belabor the obvious.</p>
        <p>A more engaging, because more imaginative, experiment, elaborately developed over many pages, is an ironic inversion of ''picturesque Austria'' that makes up the book's central image: a man-made lake on whose dead waters, thick with malignant algae, no ducks will alight, where children instinctively fear to swim, and where, almost fittingly, two strolling men find the corpse of a murdered girl. A nearby inn stands, ''adorned with a geranium dirndl blouse,'' at the foot of a mountain so thoroughly hollowed-out by mining works that it is about to collapse.</p>
        <p>From these socioanalytical excursions we return to the lives of the marionettes, which is to say, to a deadly and deadening world of mechanical violence, sexual depravity, greed and commercial cliché. Because of its one-dimensional nihilism, the book as a whole resembles that lake. Just try fishing for anything remotely lifelike here -- there will be no nibbles, no bites.</p>
        <p>Instead you will find the purely rhetorical life of a language engaged in a program of perpetual derision and snide deprecation. It does not help that Jelinek's style displays verbal dexterity, that she juggles high diction together with low dialect and jargon, erudite reference with wordplay and puns. Every witty turn comes with full marching orders. There is no freedom in this play.</p>
        <p>Martin Chalmers's translation retains Jelinek's tone of mordant irony, and reproduces the complex, meandering form of her sentences. Occasionally his fidelity leads him to import German syntax and even German punctuation into English. Some of Jelinek's linguistic sparkle is lost, perhaps of necessity; but so are her untranslatable puns, which are often more banal than clever.</p>
        <p>Jelinek has described herself as a kind of scientist who dispassionately ''looks into the petri dish of society.'' But her procedure in ''Greed'' is more like that of a prosecuting attorney in a trial of the indefensible, with effigies standing in for the accused, no judge or jury, no court protocol and of course no counsel for the defense. There is an invited public, which, one has to assume, shares the prosecutor's resentments. No one else, except perhaps a conscientious reviewer, would sit out her entire presentation.</p>
        <p>Not that she cares much if you stay or leave: ''You can complain all you like about boredom while you're reading this, but please not to me,'' she writes.</p>
        <p>Eighty-seven pages later she says: ''You're yawning. You've heard it all before. I know.'' Her indifference is admirable. It is also annoying. She does appear to be entertaining herself, though. She refers to herself as ''I'' and, like a ventriloquist, projects her voice into Kurt and Gerti and also into ideas like Nature and Death and God. But the many ''I'''s all speak in the same snide, sarcastic tone. It is, in a way, a parody of ventriloquism. One is not delighted by the trick, because no magic is even attempted. Everything is already known in this sad, ugly universe; any sign of discovery or wonder would disturb the illusion of a world without hope.</p>
        <p>And yet there is a startling moment when, perhaps depleted from prosecutorial duties, the protean ''I'' takes pause to address you, the reader, in a tone for which nothing in nearly 200 pages has prepared you: ''I hear music, it's like my wasted life, one hears it from far off, the music of life, and a moment later it's faded away again. I can't do any better unfortunately. I suggest that you, at least, get up quietly and go home, any book lying there, I'm sure, will be able to do it better.''</p>
        <p>It is hard to escape the impression that this is the author speaking of and for herself. I have slightly amended Martin Chalmers's rendition to bring out more clearly the sadness and intimacy of this communication, unprotected as it is by even a hint of irony.</p>
        <p>In an interview she gave to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung after receiving the Nobel Prize, Jelinek said that until then, she had written against great inner resistance (''like constantly having to vomit'') out of a sense of social and political obligation, and that now she would like to experience what it is like to write for pleasure. That might be something for her readers to look forward to as well.</p>

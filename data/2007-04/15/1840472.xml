        <p>WITH bouncy bass lines and bouncier hairstyles, the electro-pop trio the Klaxons have brought a rainbow-dappled splash of fun to the British music climate of bedroom brooders. Their futuristic good-time grooves suggest they are having a party and inviting everyone.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to be an alien pop band,'' said Jamie Reynolds, 26, the bassist who formed the band with James Righton, 23, keyboards, and Simon Taylor, 24, guitar, a year and a half ago. They released their debut album, ''Myths of the Near Future,'' in the United States last month.</p>

        <p>Eating and drinking in the East Village, members of the British electro-pop trio wonder what they would order if they were on “Sex and the City.”</p>

        <p>WITH bouncy bass lines and bouncier hairstyles, the electro-pop trio the Klaxons have brought a rainbow-dappled splash of fun to the British music climate of bedroom brooders. Their futuristic good-time grooves suggest they are having a party and inviting everyone.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to be an alien pop band,'' said Jamie Reynolds, 26, the bassist who formed the band with James Righton, 23, keyboards, and Simon Taylor, 24, guitar, a year and a half ago. They released their debut album, ''Myths of the Near Future,'' in the United States last month.</p>
        <p>''Let's all eat and drink the same thing all night and see who gets the most twisted,'' said Mr. Righton while sampling the brandy at Kión, a Peruvian-Japanese restaurant in the East Village.</p>
        <p>The three Klaxons and their touring drummer, Steff Halperin, 21, were perusing the menu last Monday after arriving in New York for a run of shows. ''What would I order if I was on 'Sex and the City'?''</p>
        <p>''Does Carrie ever come here?'' asked Mr. Taylor.</p>
        <p>''Doesn't she live in the fish-packing district?'' replied Mr. Righton, who liked the sound of the fish of the day and ordered for the table. ''Trout! That's five trouts then, and one for yourself, Steve.''</p>
        <p>The waiter's name was not Steve. ''We call everybody Steve,'' Mr. Reynolds said dryly. ''Including each other.''</p>
        <p>The four Englishmen bantered quicker than the beats on their album, especially when discussing their contemporaries, like the Fratellis (''meat and veg guitar music''), and Razorlight (''his feet can't touch the pedals on his motorbike''). Bloc Party got off easy. ''We bowled with them yesterday and they beat us just,'' Mr. Reynolds said.</p>
        <p>After appetizers, entrees and more than a few rounds, the men launched into a debate about the night life in their East London neighborhood versus Brooklyn. Mr. Reynolds was disappointed by his bandmates' lack of loyalty. ''London is happening,'' he maintained.</p>
        <p>''The Tava burnt down last night,'' Mr. Taylor said nonchalantly.</p>
        <p>''How'd you find that out?'' asked Mr. Reynolds, his eyes widening.</p>
        <p>''I got told,'' Mr. Taylor replied.</p>
        <p>''What happened?'' Mr. Reynolds continued irritably. ''Our favorite restaurant burned down and you're telling me 'I got told'?''</p>
        <p>''Well, how else would I know, a telepathic message?'' Mr. Taylor snapped.</p>
        <p>''The trout was something else,'' Mr. Righton interjected, then paused for comic effect. ''Meaning it wasn't actually trout -- it was salmon or fishcake.'' The others laughed and the tension dispersed.</p>
        <p>White Russians served as dessert and then the men were ready to take on the town, except for Mr. Taylor. ''I have horrible jet lag,'' he said. ''They won't medicate you in England because it's a real problem.''</p>
        <p>Insomnia aside, the Klaxons, emissaries of all things psychedelic, have not hidden their affection for popping party pills, so much so that they've received scolding messages through their MySpace page. ''People from Minneapolis wrote to us and said 'You're causing 12-year-olds to die' and they instilled the fear in us,'' Mr. Reynolds said.</p>
        <p>For their late-night activity, the men settled on the rock bar Black &amp; White.</p>
        <p>The band reveled in a Monday night in New York; Mr. Righton chatted with members of the Bravery and Mr. Halperin received hairstyle approval from the actor Josh Hartnett, all to the sounds of the Smiths.</p>
        <p>''We're having the maddest party in our lives,'' Mr. Righton said with a laugh. ''We are indeed a party band.''</p>

        <p>IT'S an all-too-familiar tale. Another Manhattan bookstore will close its doors at the end of this year because its owners can no longer afford the rent. This time, however, the bookshop has 792 other locations.</p>
        <p>As proof that even chain stores can struggle in New York, Barnes &amp; Noble, the nationwide bookselling giant, is shutting its three-story store at 4 Astor Place at year's end after 13 years at that location.</p>
        <p>''The rent has become too high,'' said Mary Ellen Keating, a company spokeswoman. ''We'd love to be able to stay, but we weren't able to work it out.''</p>
        <p>The building is owned by Lafayette-Astor Associates, whose managing partner, Jeff Gural, said Barnes &amp; Noble's rent, for 27,000 square feet, was $1.15 million a year. Mr. Gural said that he had offered to renew the lease at the same rate, but that Barnes &amp; Noble had sought a 25 percent reduction. ''Not all landlords are greedy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When news of the closing was announced to employees last week, Sherilyn Searcy, who has worked as a saleswoman in the store since November, said there were a few ''sad faces.'' A company spokeswoman declined to say how many people worked at the store but said that all employees ''in good standing'' would be transferred to other Barnes &amp; Noble stores.</p>
        <p>Reactions among customers unaware of the impending closing were mixed.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a lovely store,'' said Sharman Wallen, who stopped by while visiting her mother, who lives in the neighborhood. ''I'm bummed.''</p>
        <p>Others said Barnes &amp; Noble was to blame.</p>
        <p>''It sounds pretty lame to me,'' David Chenkin, who lives on East 33rd Street, said as he headed into the store to browse. ''After putting so many independents out of business, now they're crying they can't pay their rent?''</p>
        <p>This opinion was shared by Robert Contant, co-owner of St. Mark's Bookshop, a 2,700-square-foot independent store that has been on nearby Third Avenue for three decades.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy to see them go,'' Mr. Contant said. ''They have a history of opening stores in markets where independent bookstores have been thriving, and then running them out of business.''</p>
        <p>He cited as an example the former Shakespeare and Company on Broadway and West 81st Street. Shakespeare and Company, which currently has six locations around the city, closed its Upper West Side store in 1996, three years after a Barnes &amp; Noble moved in a block away offering deep discounts and a wide selection.</p>
        <p>St. Mark's also had a difficult time in the first three years after Barnes &amp; Noble moved to Astor Place, but the small bookstore carved out a niche by offering an extensive selection of poetry, critical theory and, more recently, graphic design. ''It was a struggle for us to survive,'' Mr. Contant said. ''But we did.''</p>

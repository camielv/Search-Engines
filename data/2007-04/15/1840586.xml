        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Don't Discard the Bottle Bill'' (editorial, April 8) is unrealistic. Adding beverages is a good idea, in theory. People discard their containers because they're too much trouble to redeem. Things need to change before adding new beverages.</p>
        <p>Try to redeem containers, you end up waiting behind three people, collecting bottles for a living, with a cart filled with bottles. After waiting 45 minutes you might be able to redeem your containers -- or not.</p>
        <p>A large percentage of containers get rejected because of unreadable barcodes or the store doesn't carry that product. Stores won't redeem them manually. If you have another store brand, you're out of luck.</p>
        <p>We need enforcement of the container redemption requirement with stiff fines for refusal of containers. Containers need to be redeemable anywhere, brand independent.</p>
        <p>Eric Soencksen  Bushwick, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your support for a proposed beverage-container law allowing the state to seize unredeemed deposits held by wholesalers (''Don't Discard the Bottle Bill,'' editorial, April 8) shows an apparent misunderstanding of how the law works now.</p>
        <p>We pay a 5-cent deposit on each beer or soda container. If we do not return them, we lose our nickels, the retailer does not pay a refund and the wholesaler still has our nickels. These nickels are the target of the proposal.</p>
        <p>The present law has another complication, often overlooked. The wholesaler keeps 5 cents for each unreturned container, but must pay 7 cents to the retailer for each container that is returned (refund of deposit plus mandatory 2-cent ''handling fee''). Nobody gets rich doing that. There is no golden pot of nickels at the end of the bottle bill rainbow.</p>
        <p>If $150 million is removed from the deposit-refund circle by the state, how will it be replaced? Obviously, other parts of the system would contribute, including consumers. Nobody knows how much, probably about 3 or 4 cents extra for each container, above the deposit.</p>
        <p>Increasing the ''handling fee'' to 3.5 cents and imposing deposits upon nearly everything people drink, except milk, wine and alcohol, would be even worse for grocery shoppers.</p>
        <p>J. Henry Neale Jr.  Scarsdale, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The writer was on the Temporary State Commission on Returnable Beverage Containers, 1983-85.</p>

        <p>THE BASICS</p>
        <p>The Orchard Garden Hotel promotes itself as California's first green hotel, but don't expect solar panels, organic hemp towels and the soothing sounds of a tropical rain forest. The hotel, which opened last November, opted for less gimmicky practices like chemical-free cleaning products, soy-based ink and recycled stationery. Even the carpet and paint are low emission. If only it had put as much love into the design. The hotel is far from stylish, and the drab and featureless interior seemed, at best, like a nice Holiday Inn. Rather than applauding its virtue, you end up wishing the Orchard had been more wasteful.</p>
        <p>LOCATION</p>
        <p>The heart of San Francisco, steps from the Chinatown Gate and a quick stroll to the Financial District and the Union Square shopping area. The street itself is pleasantly sedate, with a couple of good restaurants and low-budget hotels.</p>
        <p>THE LOBBY</p>
        <p>A small dripping waterfall welcomes guests, but the lobby is otherwise bereft of warmth. The front desk, restaurant and bar are an indistinguishable blur of beige. Despite some early media buzz, few guests lingered on a recent weekend, adding to the emptiness.</p>
        <p>THE ROOMS</p>
        <p>Who says being green and stylish don't mix? Well, the Orchard, for one. My standard room, No. 709, was wall-to-wall beige, with virtually no touches of home, unless you count the big ''Thank You for Not Smoking'' sign on the table. It felt like sleeping in a plain cardboard box. Still, the box was spacious and bright, thanks to large (hermetically sealed) floor-to-ceiling windows. Perhaps too bright -- all the lamps are fitted with 60-watt compact fluorescent bulbs, making the room feel like a Starbucks after sundown. Sure, they're energy efficient, but so is a dimmer switch.</p>
        <p>THE BATHROOM</p>
        <p>Large but cold, with generic fixtures and countertops. A tabletop cardboard sign urges guests to conserve water, which is easy when the shower has a low-flow spout and the tub takes 11 minutes to fill. The toilet, however, did an amazing job with a small gulp of water, though the recycled bathroom tissue was not exactly soft.</p>
        <p>AMENITIES</p>
        <p>For an energy-conscious hotel, there's a surprising number of things that plug in, including a large flat-screen TV, iPod docking stereo, in-room coffee maker, DVD player and mini-refrigerator, to name five. There's also free Wi-Fi. The closet-size gym is barely worth mentioning, as is the tiny rooftop terrace.</p>
        <p>THE GREEN</p>
        <p>The Orchard is registered to be certified green by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. Other earth-friendly features include wood certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, carpeting made of recycled materials and drapes and guestroom wastebaskets with dividers for bottles and newspapers. The hotel also uses an energy-saving key card system -- common in European hotels -- that shuts off the lights and electricity when the card is pulled from a wall slot.</p>
        <p>ROOM SERVICE</p>
        <p>Room service was not yet available during a visit in January (it now is), though the hotel's just-opened restaurant, Roots, offered to deliver food in a doggie bag. The missing menu, however, took two calls and 20 minutes to be printed and delivered. Maybe the place ran out of soy-based ink. A breakfast buffet, included in the price of the room, includes fresh melons, granola, juices and organic coffee.</p>
        <p>BOTTOM LINE</p>
        <p>A hotel version of a Toyota Prius -- low points on style and comfort, but plenty of environmental bragging rights. The 86 rooms start at $169 for a standard double with an interior view. The Orchard Garden Hotel, 466 Bush Street, San Francisco; (415) 399-9807; www.theorchardgardenhotel.com.</p>

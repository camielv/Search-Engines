        <p>HITSVILLE, U.K.: America has Britney, Paris and Lindsay. In England, the tabloid hotties are the WAGs -- ''wives and girlfriends,'' that is, of soccer stars. Now that Victoria and David Beckham have fled to Los Angeles, England's reigning WAG is Coleen McLoughlin, whose memoir ''Welcome to My World'' recently held the No. 1 position on the Times of London nonfiction list. Born in Liverpool, McLoughlin is engaged to the Manchester United star Wayne Rooney, a big lunk who's sometimes compared to Shrek in the press. McLoughlin got off to a bad start with Britain's media; in 2005 the headline ''Coleen Top Chav'' appeared in The Sun -- the term ''chav'' basically meaning, depending on whom you ask, ''cheap and vulgar.'' But she's gone on to become, thanks to charity work and layouts in magazines like British Vogue, a style icon and a fashion muse as well as (according to The Observer) ''the nation's sweetheart.'' None of this means, of course, her book isn't horrible to contemplate. According to The Daily Mail, the thing reads as if McLoughlin was ''forced into the basement of her publishers at gunpoint and ordered to dictate 80,000 random words into a Dictaphone.''</p>
        <p>MORE FROM BRITAIN: Have England's boys gone soft? That's Conn Iggulden's thesis in ''The Dangerous Book for Boys,'' an anti-P.C. manifesto, written with his brother, that's become a phenomenon in Britain, selling some 520,000 copies in the past few months. (At the start of April it was No. 2 on the Times of London nonfiction list.) Iggulden deplores what he calls ''the whole health and safety culture that constricts the freedom of our kids''; his book teaches them to do things like shoot and skin a rabbit and build treehouses and slingshots. But can't you bond with your son, Iggulden was asked by The Sunday Times of London, over a video game? His response: ''No, because it's a passive activity. There's something magical about the age-old skills. When your father tells you how to hold a chisel you remember it for the rest of your life; when he tells you how to kill a dragon on Level 4 it's not the same.''</p>
        <p>SUBMISSIONS: Iggulden also happens to be a best-selling fiction writer in England -- he writes pulpy historical novels -- who was rejected so many times when he was younger that he came up with an ingenious method to tell if a publisher had even bothered to read his manuscript. ''I would pull hairs off my head and hide them in the pages,'' he told The Daily Mail. ''If they were still there when it came back, I would know that they had not read it.''</p>
        <p>NOTES: Cormac McCarthy's most recent novel, ''The Road,'' picked by Oprah for her book club, debuts at No. 2 on the paperback fiction list this week; it is boxed out of the top spot by a Mary Higgins Clark novel. (The hardcover version of ''The Road'' climbs back to No. 20 on the extended list.) ... Ishmael Beah's memoir, ''A Long Way Gone,'' which has been near the top of the hardcover nonfiction list for seven weeks, finally makes it to No. 1. ... And on the advice list, there's another best seller whose title can't be printed in its entirety here: Robert Sutton's ''No ------- Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That Isn't'' slides onto the list for the first time at No. 5.</p>

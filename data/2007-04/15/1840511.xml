        <p>On May 22, 2000, a tour bus struck and killed Randolph Walker, a 71-year-old actor, as he crossed 45th Street on the west side of Ninth Avenue. The tour guide later testified that he and the driver had been looking ahead as they turned onto the side street, yet saw no one in the crosswalk.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 23, Nina Petrow, 55, was killed in the same spot by another tour bus turning off the avenue.</p>
        <p>The second death has revived neighbors' long-held suspicions about a pair of phone booths, joined into a single roofed cabin, that sit perhaps 12 feet north of the intersection. They say the double booths can briefly block pedestrians from the view of drivers turning onto the street.</p>
        <p>''After this second instance, we all went, 'Well, duh,' '' said Ren√©e Stanley, a stage manager who lives on 44th Street near Ninth Avenue and saw Mr. Walker get hit. ''Once is an accident. Twice, there's a direct line.''</p>
        <p>Lee Compton, chairman of Community Board 4, has asked the city's Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to remove the phone booths, calling it ''troubling'' that ''an 8-foot-tall-by-6-foot-wide visual barrier was placed so close to this dangerous intersection.''</p>
        <p>According to Nicholas Sbordone, a spokesman for the technology department, the phone booths' placement complies with city rules and the booths' operator, Telebeam Telecommunications Corporation, has disputed the contention that they are ''a nuisance.''</p>
        <p>Osmin Montjovier, who sells books and records from a table at the intersection, counsels pedestrians to be wary. ''Watch this lady here,'' Mr. Montjovier said as a woman and a turning taxi neared the intersection from different directions.</p>
        <p>He began to narrate an imagined accident: ''The guy who's driving is on his cellphone. He wants to make that turn, and he can't see anything. All of a sudden, somebody's there -- oh, damn!''</p>

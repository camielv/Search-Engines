        <p>A table last Sunday with a report on executive pay referred incorrectly to equity holdings of Michael L. Eskew, chief executive of United Parcel Service. Their total value, though listed at $535,010,884, included $514.5 million in shares he does not own; they are held in trusts he helps to control on behalf of the company. He owned $17.7 million in shares outright.</p>
        <p>The table also misstated the value of equity holdings of Glenn A. Britt, C.E.O. of Time Warner Cable. It was $10.5 million, not $25.8 million.</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 22, 2007, Sunday  A table on April 8 with a report on executive pay included an incorrect figure from Equilar Inc., an executive compensation research firm, for the value of equity holdings of Glenn A. Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable. And a correction in this space last Sunday gave another incorrect figure from the firm for those equity holdings. The value was $10.8 million -- not $25.8 million or $10.5 million.</p>

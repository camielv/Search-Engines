      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Kellie Kvern, 35, from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, exploring an old quarter of Beijing in the process of being demolished: ''I went back to Beijing for three weeks; I had lived there for three years as a student and as a teacher of English. I hadn't been back in 10 years, so this trip was just to see the city again. It's pretty common that these homes are going down to make way for new stuff. We met a family that was still living in that neighborhood, and they invited us into their house to have lunch. I can't imagine that they were thrilled about the demolition, but we didn't have any conversations about it. Everything just changes so fast there. I brought a friend of mine from New York who had never been, and she and I were in the same boat. Going back after 10 years was really like going to the city for the first time.''</p>

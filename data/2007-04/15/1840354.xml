      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I would not deny poor people the satisfaction that comes with effective money management and savings (Rachel Louise Snyder, April 1). But I see little to celebrate in America Saves, where the daily deprivation of what most Americans take for granted (sweets and bread, for example) is necessary for a minimum-wage earner to accumulate even a small savings account. What kind of security can those meager savings buy for such times of real need as unemployment, retirement and health crises? Let's address the frugality training to the privileged, whose excessive consumption withdraws money from the public good and deteriorates our environment.</p>

        <p>A few years ago, I took a group of college juniors and seniors from our church on a ''mission'' trip to Ashe County, N.C., to fix up houses of the poor people who lived there. One group spent most of the week working on a house that needed demolition more than repairs, except it was home to an elderly couple who had little else in the world. She had diabetes, and he was crippled by arthritis. The students repaired a rickety pair of front steps, patched holes in a rusted tin roof, replaced rotted floor boards, adjusted the front door so that it could be closed and replaced several windowpanes.</p>
        <p>When it was time to leave, the husband and wife gathered outside with the students and led the singing of a couple of hymns. ''We have a little something to thank you for helping us,'' she said, handing the students two oranges. ''We got them as a Christmas gift and were saving them for a special occasion. We want you to enjoy them.'' It's hard to believe that poor people don't know how to save. They save what is valuable and spend when it counts the most.</p>

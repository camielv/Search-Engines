      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial, noting recent article by Mary Williams Walsh, holds New Jersey's pension problem began in September 1993, when Christie Whitman, then Republican candidate for governor, promised to cut most income taxes 30 percent over three years in last-ditch effort to overcome resurgence of incumbent Jim Florio</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>If anything good comes out of New Jersey's pension crisis, it will be a newfound awareness among politicians and voters alike of the dangers of overblown promises to cut taxes. Overpromising, together with the willingness of both Democrats and Republicans to use any gimmick conceivable to avoid a tax increase, is what put New Jersey in such deep trouble in the first place.</p>
        <p>The essence of the problem, as The Times's Mary Williams Walsh revealed, is that there is nowhere near enough money in the bank to pay New Jersey's looming pension obligations. But the origin of the problem is traceable to September 1993, when Christie Whitman, then the Republican candidate for governor, promised to cut most income taxes 30 percent over three years in a last-minute effort to overcome the surprisingly resurgent incumbent, Jim Florio.</p>

        <p>If anything good comes out of New Jersey's pension crisis, it will be a newfound awareness among politicians and voters alike of the dangers of overblown promises to cut taxes. Overpromising, together with the willingness of both Democrats and Republicans to use any gimmick conceivable to avoid a tax increase, is what put New Jersey in such deep trouble in the first place.</p>
        <p>The essence of the problem, as The Times's Mary Williams Walsh revealed, is that there is nowhere near enough money in the bank to pay New Jersey's looming pension obligations. But the origin of the problem is traceable to September 1993, when Christie Whitman, then the Republican candidate for governor, promised to cut most income taxes 30 percent over three years in a last-minute effort to overcome the surprisingly resurgent incumbent, Jim Florio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio had been lagging in the polls for weeks partly because he had raised taxes, but he had pulled even. At the urging of her advisers, Mrs. Whitman, a moderate by instinct, promised a huge tax cut and pledged to pay for it by making whatever spending cuts were necessary. Mrs. Whitman won, though narrowly, but upon taking office she found it difficult to make up for the lost revenue; big spending cuts were almost impossible since about half the money in New Jersey budgets is legally obligated and cannot be eliminated.</p>
        <p>In 1997, facing deficits not only in the state budget but also in the pension fund -- a deficit caused by years of missed payments and other fiscal sleights of hand -- she and her advisers came up with an ingenious proposal to stave off the problem: borrow more than $2.7 billion against the pension fund and use the money to make up for the revenue gaps. With the economy flourishing, the interest the state would have to pay on the loan would be more than a percentage point below the rosy estimates of what the money could earn through investments. That would be enough to eliminate the need for immediate contributions to the pension fund and help out with the state's budget.</p>
        <p>And for a while it worked, as the money earned far more than even the optimistic estimates had forecast. Then the stock market faltered, the investments turned sour and New Jersey's pension fund bled red ink.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman was not the first governor -- nor the last -- to use fiscal gimmickry. Stunned by the reaction to his tax increase, Mr. Florio came up with numerous tricks to avoid more tax hikes or severe budget cuts. And Donald DiFrancesco, who became acting governor in 2001 when Mrs. Whitman joined the Bush administration, delivered the coup de grâce. With his eye on the coming campaign, he persuaded the Legislature to enhance pension benefits for teachers and state workers without financing the increases. James McGreevey, his Democratic successor, used fiscal trickery of his own.</p>
        <p>The result is a fiscal crisis in Trenton like few have ever seen. Gov. Jon Corzine, who has promised to do whatever is necessary, will have no alternative but to propose higher taxes, a sell-off of state assets like the New Jersey Turnpike or whatever draconian budget cuts can be made. He may have to come up with a mix of all three.</p>
        <p>So here is the painful lesson. When politicians make promises that seem too good to be true, when they provide benefits without raising the money to cover them, the chickens will come home to roost and, just as surely, the taxpayers will pay the price.</p>

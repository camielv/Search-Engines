        <p>Dance will be jumping through both stages of Symphony Space. In the Peter Jay Sharp Theater the muscular men of LES BALLETS GRANDIVA will put on ballerinas' tutus for some pointed comic looks at the conventions of classical ballet. But there will be more than sight gags, as the troupe hopes to unite technical precision with theatrical flair. Over in the intimate Leonard Nimoy Thalia Theater, as part of the Gender Benders series, which features sometimes serious and sometimes lighthearted explorations of the sexes, two groups share a program. MONICA BILL BARNES &amp; COMPANY examines contemporary issues facing women. NICOLAS LEICHTER DANCE presents dancers in pairings that are also culture clashes. Grandiva, Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.; $21 to $26, $15 for students and 65+. Barnes and Leichter troupes , Thursday through Saturday at 8:30 p.m.; $21 in advance, $25 day of performance. Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org.</p>
        <p>Two new productions by LES BALLETS JAZZ DE MONTRÉAL will demonstrate that ballet can involve more than the five traditional positions and that jazz can mean different things in different countries. ''Mapa,'' by the Brazilian choreographer Rodrigo Pederneiras, unites Brazilian dance forms and rhythms with classical ballet. Azure Barton's ''Chambres de Jacques'' dances its way through both Vivaldi arias and folk songs from Quebec. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., next Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org, $40.</p>
        <p>Nothing's coming to Dance Theater Workshop, but that may be cause for rejoicing, for this nothing is really something. It's the two-week NOTHING FESTIVAL organized by Tere O'Connor, who asked various choreographers and groups to create premieres totally from scratch with no stories, no music and no outside sources. This week's participants are Douglas Dunn, Hijack, Sam Kim and Dean Moss. (Other dancers perform April 25-28.) Wednesday through Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $20, $12 students and 65+.</p>

        <p>The big attraction in New York this week is the public opening on Friday of the new GREEK AND ROMAN GALLERIES at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. With 30,000 square feet of space and more than 5,000 objects, it rounds out the story of ancient Western Classical culture in imperious style with a sweep through Hellenism and Augustan Rome to the coming of Christianity. Add the fascinations of Etruscan art, and you have a panoramic adventure to look forward to. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.</p>
        <p>A day later the opening of ''GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE'' at the Drawing Center in SoHo takes us from the grand to the antimonumental. This survey of work by the German-born Venezuelan artist Gertrud Goldschmidt (1912-1994), who went by the name of Gego, includes ink drawings on paper and in meshlike weavings of stainless-steel wire. Little known outside Latin America until fairly recently, Gego, with her fragile but tensile linear art, is now recognized as one of the most memorable of the late 20th century. Through July 21, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org.</p>
        <p>Finally there are two memorable exhibitions outside Manhattan. In Brooklyn a lively group show called ''POSTMILLENNIAL BLACK MADONNA,'' with new works by 23 young artists, is split between two enterprising institutions, the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts in Fort Greene (through May 12, 80 Hanson Place, 718-230-0492, mocada.org) and the Skylight Gallery of the Restoration Plaza in Bedford-Stuyvesant (through May 5, 1368 Fulton Street, third floor, 718-636-6976, restorationplaza.org). I also recommend another ensemble effort, ''A JAMAICA, QUEENS THING,'' in which a bunch of smart young artists look back at the South Queens music scene of two decades ago. It's at the Jamaica Center for Arts &amp; Learning, a classic example of a grass-roots alternative space. Through June 2, 161-04 Jamaica Avenue, (718) 658-7400, jcal.org.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was a Clinton appointee to the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, that ''obscure'' State Department panel that was the subject of Jeremy Kahn's article ''Is the U.S. Protecting Foreign Artifacts? Don't Ask'' [April 8]. I fully endorse the arguments that the appointed membership of the panel is heavily skewed toward the archaeologists' perspective and that the committee's activities are inappropriately secretive. The public should be made aware of those who have been empowered to direct America's foreign cultural policy -- and hold them accountable.</p>

        <p>Moreover, there is no acknowledgment in the wording of the determinations that guide the panel's actions of the value and importance of collecting -- the principle that lies at the very heart of the great encyclopedic museums of the world.</p>

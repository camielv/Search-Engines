        <p>If you've always wanted a skyline painted on your nails or the hair waxed off your big toe, all you have to do is ask. The former is available at Manhattan's BanyanCiti Spa, albeit unadvertised, and the latter can, if you pipe up, be happily accommodated at Bliss. Repeat spagoers are discovering what friends of the house have come to expect at swanky restaurants: that dishes not on the menu are available to regulars by request. There is a trove of extra services out there -- Cornelia Day Resort will send your watch to Cartier to be repaired, and if you're bored while your color bakes, Salon Eliut Rivera will order up a reflexologist -- but these extras are hush-hush. Why? Cost-effectiveness, for one thing. Some places may have another reason. As Nathaniel Hawkins, a stylist and spokesman for Tresemmé, explained, salons don't always have insurance for things like brow dying, but if the staff leaves a Q-tip and a bowl of dye next to you, who's to know?</p>

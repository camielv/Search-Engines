        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Brooks (''The Fatalist,'' column, April 12) tells us that John McCain believes that he has ''an obligation to seek victory'' in Iraq ''as long as there is any chance of it.'' But is there any chance of it? And is there anything -- anything at all -- that would persuade Senator McCain that victory is impossible?</p>
        <p>Certainly, it's hard to hold out much hope of winning when things look as terrible as they do now, and when we haven't even been given a consistent account of what would count as a ''win.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Brooks (''The Fatalist,'' column, April 12) tells us that John McCain believes that he has ''an obligation to seek victory'' in Iraq ''as long as there is any chance of it.'' But is there any chance of it? And is there anything -- anything at all -- that would persuade Senator McCain that victory is impossible?</p>
        <p>Certainly, it's hard to hold out much hope of winning when things look as terrible as they do now, and when we haven't even been given a consistent account of what would count as a ''win.''</p>
        <p>Senator McCain's insistence that things are getting better, that we are making progress -- as with his recent Potemkin tour of a Baghdad marketplace -- suggests that he's more willing to abandon his grip on reality than to give up on this war. It's almost as if he sees a triumph in Iraq as standing in for the victory he and his generation never achieved in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>That's more straitjacket thinking than ''straight talk,'' if you ask me.</p>
        <p>Eric B. Lipps  Staten Island, April 12, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you, David Brooks, for setting the facts straight on John McCain. I served with him in a previous war where political incompetence was slightly exceeded only by that of President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.</p>
        <p>I take issue with the notion of Senator McCain's ''fatalism.'' In aviation circles, we call it ''the breaks of naval air,'' to remind us that the best and the brightest are not always the most likely to survive.</p>
        <p>I disagree with the point that Senator McCain ''doesn't grapple with the psychology and culture of the Iraqis.'' What can we do to get the Iraqis to take charge? Unfortunately, all we can do is provide a little breathing room for their leadership to rise or fall.</p>
        <p>The surge we see now is minimal to that which will be required to cover a withdrawal, should Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, so recommend.</p>
        <p>William J. Catlett  Chester, N.J., April 13, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is a retired United States Navy captain.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It's all very well to claim that John McCain knew for years that the Iraq war was being mismanaged by President Bush, former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and others and to say that Senator McCain brought this to President Bush's attention. The cold fact is that during those years, Mr. McCain showed unswerving public devotion to that mismanagement.</p>
        <p>He never had the courage to criticize blatant incompetence, and he never made a peep publicly about his concerns. Now he supports the surge, which is supported by the hard-core true believers of the Republican base, so his political courage is once again in doubt.</p>
        <p>Senator McCain may be deeply sad. We are all deeply sad. But he is not qualified to lead.</p>
        <p>Beth Larson  Washington, April 12, 2007</p>

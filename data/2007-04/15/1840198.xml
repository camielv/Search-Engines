        <p>KOENIG--Richard. I regret to announce the death of Richard Koenig, Controller of the American Branch of the Cambridge University Press from 1969 to 1985. He died March 10th after a battle with cancer. A resident of Deerfield Beach, Florida, Richard was 87. He was a man of great wit and wisdom acquired over a life well lived. Richard was born in 1920 in Vienna, Austria and escaped as a young man in his late teens from the Nazi persecution. He was a passenger on the last ship out of Europe before the outbreak of World War II. He landed in New York in 1939 on the day war was declared in Europe without knowing a single person in the entire country and with four dollars in his pocket. He described spending the final night on the ship's deck and being rewarded in the morning with ''one of the most magnificent sights I have ever seen: the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan slowly emerging out of the darkness and mist, first as very faint silhouettes that seemed to change shape every few seconds and finally as buildings that appeared to grow out of the water.'' Having secured the promise of a job in Los Angeles before leaving Europe, Richard traveled by bus from New York to Los Angeles on a route that wound through Arizona and New Mexico to San Diego and then up the coast to Los Angeles. He described the journey as ''hot, uncomfortable and magnificent.'' Richard loved his adopted country and returned to New York by about 1945. He worked in publishing for the rest of his working life; first with Viking Press, then New American Library, Walker &amp; Company and finally Cambridge University Press. Richard is survived by friends and colleagues at Cambridge who were honored to have known him and who will never forget this remarkable man.</p>

        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) DRIVE -- Adding new meaning to the term ''road rage'' is the two-hour premiere of this dramatic series, in which a diverse group crisscrosses the country in a race for their lives and a rumored $32 million. Revving their engines: a man in search of his missing wife, a stressed-out single mother, a scientist and his rebellious teenage daughter, two brothers in a pimped-out Caddy, a handful of Hurricane Katrina survivors and a mysterious (and of course beautiful) stowaway.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (13) VOYAGE OF THE LONELY TURTLE -- She's one tough broad. This ''Nature'' special follows an intrepid female loggerhead from Mexico to Japan as she sets off to lay eggs in the place she was born. The solitary, yearlong odyssey across 9,000 miles of the Pacific is among the longest migrations by sea or land. It's far from smooth sailing, fraught with typhoons, fishing vessels, sharks and a sperm whale, which, fortunately for the turtle, prefers to dine on 50-foot squid with eyes the size of dinner plates.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Lifetime) THE STAIRCASE MURDERS -- Treat Williams affects a menacing air in this adaptation of the real-life story of Michael Peterson, the best-selling novelist who said he found his wife dead at the bottom of a staircase in their North Carolina home after a drunken fall, but whose stepdaughter has accused him of murder. Secrets abound: his wife's finances, his own bisexuality and a friend who, in 1985, was also found dead at the bottom of a staircase. Hmmm. The actual Mr. Peterson is currently serving a life sentence.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13) JIHAD: THE MEN AND IDEAS BEHIND AL QAEDA -- The first of 11 films being shown on PBS this week in the series ''America at a Crossroads,'' examining the challenges confronting the world in the aftermath of Sept. 11, this documentary looks at modern radical Islamic groups, the beliefs that inspire them and the challenges they pose for governments both in the Middle East and the West.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (VH1) I LOVE NEW YORK: REUNION SHOW -- That tart apple New York and her, shall we say expressive, mother, Sister Patterson, left, face down the men (at least those not in jail, recovery or therapy) who didn't pass muster. Afterward New York and Tango are reunited for the first time since he surprised her with his proclamation of marital intent. But is the couple still headed to the altar?</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (VH1) FLAVOR OF LOVE GIRLS: CHARM SCHOOL -- Thirteen defiantly rude women from the first two seasons of ''Flavor of Love'' -- Smiley, Serious, Goldie, Pumkin, Rain, Hottie, Saaphyri, Bootz, Buckwild, Like Dat, Buckeey, Krazy and Toastee -- learn a little class at the hands of that bodacious beauty Mo'Nique. But first a little forced teamwork with a Marine-style boot camp and a comprehension course in the school's 10 commandments. No. 1: ''Check thyself before thou wreckest thyself.'' No. 2: ''Thou shalt goeth, girl.'' And No. 10: ''Thou shalt be fully fabulous.''</p>

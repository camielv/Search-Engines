        <p>CALL it what you will: individuality, perhaps contrarianism? The narrow confines of established music categories seem to bring out the defiance in artists. The Brazilian singer Bebel Gilberto, daughter of the well-regarded musicians João Gilberto and Miúcha, suggests she is pioneering her own style: ''Bebelmusic.'' Ms. Gilberto's second album was nominated for a Grammy. Her third, ''Momento'' (Six Degrees), is being released April 24. Ms. Gilberto compared putting out an album to raising a child: ''The baby is now walking.'' Songs on her album freewheel between English and Portuguese. Her lyrics of love and longing flutter and repeat in a blend of Brazilian beats, with alternating pulsating and breathy electronica. This month Ms. Gilberto, 40, begins a world tour, starting in London and stopping in the United States in May. From her apartment in Manhattan, she spoke with Winter Miller about what she's listening to now and why.</p>
        <p>Marcelo D2</p>
        <p>I am a big fan of his, and I would love to be his friend. (I'm not.) I would love to be his girlfriend actually. (Tomorrow.) Marcelo's music is like samba rock; he's the one who first started doing this stuff about eight years ago. It's not something to just listen to or to make love or cook to; it's really great to dance to. It's really up. It has a bit of rap, but in a way that I've never seen any Brazilian doing rap. With rap you can approach it so traditionally, but he does it with layers and sounds. He works a lot with samples, and he uses things that most people don't even know. He mixes everything together, and simultaneously it sounds so rough and so sophisticated. It would be hard to pick one song as my favorite because I just love all of ''Meu Samba É Assim'' (Sony).</p>
        <p>Kassin + 2</p>
        <p>This is the third disc in a trilogy with Kassin and his band mates, Moreno Veloso and Domenico Lancellotti. ''Futurismo'' (Luaka Bop) is a beautiful mix of modern, experimental electronica and more classical Brazilian sounds. Kassin has a big following with the young generation today in Brazil, and he is a great bass player too. The song I cannot stop listening and singing along to is ''Ya Ya Ya,'' which is lovely; it is inspired by the music we always used to hear on Rio's beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana.</p>
        <p>Charlotte Gainsbourg</p>
        <p>I just love the whisper of her voice. I am absolutely spellbound by ''5:55'' (Because/Atlantic). I saw her play a long time ago when I was young and wondering what I would do with my life. This album has such intense material. The production by Air is unbelievable; it brings her persona to the forefront. I love the birds at the beginning of ''Little Monsters.'' The song has this piano line that goes from the top to the end, with a beautiful bridge. I remember the first time I heard this song; I was really enjoying it and then the bridge came along, and I was like wooooo! I like ''AF607105''; it's a song about flying. The music is just so intense I didn't even pay attention to the lyrics, but there's humor hiding inside the words. But first I got hypnotized by it. The more times you hear this album, the more you discover how incredible it is. I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it.</p>
        <p>'Marie Antoinette'</p>
        <p>This film is intense. I am a big Sofia Coppola fan. This is a good example of when feminism comes across in a film directed by a woman. It really hit me how she came up with a soundtrack that's so modern and by so many different people against this historical story that we all know; it's such a good contrast. ''Marie Antoinette'' (Verve Forecast) is a soundtrack you can listen to nonstop. It will remind you of the '80s. As you listen, you say: ''I've heard this before. How can this be paired with Marie Antoinette? It sounds perfect together.'' I don't know how she could have done it better. I am someone who loves soundtracks. There are many CDs that I love because I've seen the films.</p>
        <p>Arling &amp; Cameron</p>
        <p>''Hi-Fi Underground'' (Challenge Records) is an album I'm still getting to know. They did an album about 10 years ago, and now they're back again. They go off and work with different people, and then they come back and work as a duo. I love the cover. It's a simple picture, but it's so well taken. Their faces are shadowed, Veronica Lake-style, but you can feel their presence. I bought this album last week, and I have listened to the song ''Open'' 30 times already. It has a synthesizer and whistling; the arrangement is so catchy. All I have to do is think about this song, and I start grooving. In ''Open'' one of them is singing on top of this whistling sound; it's superromantic. The lyrics could be the tackiest thing, but it's so charming and beautiful. He has this deep great voice. It really touched me.</p>

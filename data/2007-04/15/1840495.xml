        <p>Correction:  April 29, 2007, Sunday  A report on April 15 about the marriage of Brooke Richie and Mark Rogers referred incorrectly to Cheddar's, a restaurant chain where the bridegroom is a general manager. Its headquarters are in Irving, Tex., not Dallas. Also, the bridegroom's father, Douglas H. Rogers, started the business with a partner, Aubrey G. Good; Mr. Rogers was not the sole founder.</p>

        <p>Best known for his buzzed bob, Christiaan Houtenbos worked with everyone from Grace Jones to Calvin Klein in the 1980s. He was also a famously bad boy, once clipping a chunk of hair from an unsuspecting fashion editor's head. Though cutting back on hours, he's still got the best photographers wrapped around his curling iron. Is your work art? It is for me. Hair is the flag of the soul. Does your hair change? All the time. I often shave my head, and the hair grows back with different patterns buzzed into it. What about your style? I wear orange underpants every day. Is there life outside of hair? I love ceramics, landscape architecture and poetry. I also take lots of photos. When I compile 86,400 images, I will make a clock with a different picture every second for 24 hours.</p>

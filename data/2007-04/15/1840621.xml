        <p>David Rosenthal says the actor Bradley Whitford seems to be a perfectly admirable guy. Mr. Whitford won an Emmy as Josh Lyman, the edgy White House deputy chief of staff, on ''The West Wing'' and founded the Clothes Off Our Back Foundation, where actors auction off their gowns and suits for charity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenthal, though, says he does not think Mr. Whitford is the type of person he wants to speak at a Princeton graduation event. Mr. Whitford went to Wesleyan University in Connecticut and studied acting at the Juilliard School in New York.</p>

        <p>David Rosenthal says the actor Bradley Whitford seems to be a perfectly admirable guy. Mr. Whitford won an Emmy as Josh Lyman, the edgy White House deputy chief of staff, on ''The West Wing'' and founded the Clothes Off Our Back Foundation, where actors auction off their gowns and suits for charity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenthal, though, says he does not think Mr. Whitford is the type of person he wants to speak at a Princeton graduation event. Mr. Whitford went to Wesleyan University in Connecticut and studied acting at the Juilliard School in New York.</p>
        <p>''If he had graduated from Princeton, like, say Brooke Shields or David Duchovny, maybe,'' said Mr. Rosenthal, a senior. ''But what does Brad Whitford have to say to a Princeton Class Day?''</p>
        <p>Each year, a committee of three seniors decides on and recruits a famous speaker for Class Day, which is the day before graduation.</p>
        <p>Former Secretary of State James Baker, a Princeton graduate, was once a Class Day speaker, but some celebrity speakers in recent years have not been Princeton alumni: Jerry Seinfeld, Bill Cosby, Jon Stewart. Last year, Bill Clinton was the speaker, although two of the three people on the committee that invited him were Lauren Bush, a niece of President Bush, and Harrison Frist, a son of the former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, a Republican and a Princeton grad himself.</p>
        <p>This year, one of the committee members is Joe Franken, the son of the comedian Al Franken, who is running for the United States Senate from Minnesota as a Democrat.</p>
        <p>The choice of Mr. Whitford started Mr. Rosenthal on a campaign to find someone else. He set up a Web site proposing Fred Hargadon, the admissions dean who retired soon after accepting the students who will graduate in June.</p>
        <p>The committee members referred questions to Thomas Dunne, associate dean of students, who in turn referred questions to a university spokeswoman, Cass Cliatt. ''Not everyone will be pleased with every choice, not here at Princeton,'' she acknowledged, but added, ''Most people, I'm sure, will enjoy Whitford, and 20 years from now, maybe they will come back and say what a good choice it was.''</p>

        <p>The stock market rose again last week, fighting off a decline on Wednesday brought about by the release of the minutes of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting.</p>
        <p>Those minutes made explicit the Fed's view that inflation, not a possible economic slowdown, is the biggest threat to the economy -- and that an increase in short-term interest rates is possible to curb inflation. Investors hoping for a rate cut presumably sold off some stock on Wednesday, but the market rebounded smartly on the next two days.</p>

        <p>The company on Friday reported a 13 percent jump in first quarter profits, outstripping the expectations of analysts as well as its own forecasts.</p>
        <p>For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 51.93 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 12,612.13. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 9.09 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1,452.85. The Nasdaq composite index rose 20.6 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 2,491.94.</p>

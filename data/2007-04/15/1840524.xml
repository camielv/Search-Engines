        <p>New York street fairs tend to make few friends among their immediate neighbors. So it is with the Feast of San Gennaro, that 79-year-old, sweat-laced confection of sweet sausages, rampant commerce and Neapolitan piety that takes over Little Italy for 11 days every autumn.</p>
        <p>''Everyone who lives around there says it's disgusting,'' said Sean Sweeney, a member of Community Board 2 who lives on Greene Street, five blocks from the fair's route on Mulberry Street.</p>

        <p>New York street fairs tend to make few friends among their immediate neighbors. So it is with the Feast of San Gennaro, that 79-year-old, sweat-laced confection of sweet sausages, rampant commerce and Neapolitan piety that takes over Little Italy for 11 days every autumn.</p>
        <p>''Everyone who lives around there says it's disgusting,'' said Sean Sweeney, a member of Community Board 2 who lives on Greene Street, five blocks from the fair's route on Mulberry Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sweeney was present last month when a subcommittee of the community board considered the fair's application for a permit for this fall. No representative of the event showed up, which usually results in a recommendation against the application. In addition, several neighbors attended and complained about noise and litter caused by the event, which in most years raises more than $100,000 for Catholic education.</p>
        <p>''They were so arrogant -- they didn't have to show up,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''It was just 'It's a tradition.'</p>
        <p>''There were Italians who were saying, 'Enough already on Mulberry Street,' '' he continued. ''No other street has to put up with an 11-day feast where people come from three states around. I said, 'Enough; slap them in the face.' ''</p>
        <p>With that, the subcommittee did something surprising. It recommended that the application for the venerated fair be denied.</p>
        <p>The vote is only advisory; permits for fairs ultimately need approval by the mayor's office. But the response to this small, symbolic rebellion has been swift. Mayor Bloomberg weighed in, calling the fair ''a part of New York.'' Vivian Catenaccio, a spokeswoman for Figli di San Gennaro, the nonprofit that runs the event, said her group had not been told of the subcommittee meeting and would have attended.</p>
        <p>The community board chairwoman, Maria Derr, gave representatives of the fair a chance to appear before the subcommittee this Tuesday and postponed a vote of the full board on the application until Thursday.</p>
        <p>''The San Gennaro feast is a very important tradition for the Italian-American community, and I hope to see it continue,'' Ms. Derr said. ''Our community is completely in support of the feast.''</p>
        <p>As for the complaints about litter and the like, Ms. Catenaccio said: ''We spend a tremendous amount of money on sanitation. The streets are cleaned every night. There are about 20 people who, before the streets are cleaned, on the hour, they run through and they pick up the garbage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sweeney was unmollified. ''I was getting my hair cut in an Italian barbershop the other day,'' he said. ''There was a guy there who was saying: 'When I was a kid, the feast was about family, religion, and food. Now it's about CDs and three socks for $10.' ''</p>

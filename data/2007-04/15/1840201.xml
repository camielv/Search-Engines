        <p>LeWITT--Sol. Sol and the group of like-minded friends founded Printed Matter in 1976. His generosity towards other artists and a wide range of radical art practices is revealed in that simple act. His own books run through his life's work like a thread, perpetually drawing us back towards his essential ideas. We remember Sol for his gentle penetrating humanity, his support of artists, friends, and art situations, his simple love of giving. The Staff and Board of Printed Matter, Inc.</p>

        <p>Like a soufflé hot out of the oven, newly created vocal works with instrumental accompaniment will be on display at Weill Recital Hall. They are the fruits of the collaboration of a group of young composers and a dozen singers, brought together in a workshop organized by Carnegie Hall and the Bard College Conservatory of Music. OSVALDO GOLIJOV, the Argentine composer, and the soprano DAWN UPSHAW, his longtime collaborator, oversaw the effort. The group developed the pieces in a workshop in November before rehearsals this month. A selection will be performed at Weill. Sunday at 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $15.</p>
        <p>For those who missed it two weeks ago, a second performance of CHARLES WUORINEN'S Percussion Symphony -- drum heaven, some might say -- takes place on Monday, courtesy of an unusual joint project by the percussion departments of the Manhattan School of Music and the Juilliard School. Complex, chaotic-sounding, fascinating and at times otherworldly, this 40-minute work is a pillar of the percussion world. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required.</p>
        <p>KARITA MATTILA, the immensely gifted soprano, gives a Carnegie Hall recital featuring an eclectic and offbeat program. The composers include Barber, Wolf, Turina, Kuula, Melartin and Granados. Wednesday at 8 p.m.; $25 to $84.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Opera will offer a grand reunion: the three one-act operas by Puccini written to be performed as ''IL TRITTICO,'' but more often done separately. They consist of ''Il Tabarro,'' a dark piece of grand guignol; the bittersweet ''Suor Angelica''; and the light, slightly acerbic ''Gianni Schicchi,'' with that beloved excerpt aria ''O mio babbino caro.'' This new production was created by Jack O'Brien, the Broadway director behind ''Hairspray.'' Maria Guleghina and Salvatore Licitra sing in ''Tabarro''; Barbara Frittoli portrays the ill-fated Sister Angelica; and Alessandro Corbelli sings that rascal Schicchi. James Levine conducts. Opening night is Friday. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $26 to $175.</p>

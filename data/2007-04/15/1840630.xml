        <p>Unfortunately, ''A New Proposal to Rescue Yonkers' Waterfront'' (April 8) did not show the actual building design proposed by the London-based architect Will Alsop.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, ''A New Proposal to Rescue Yonkers' Waterfront'' (April 8) did not show the actual building design proposed by the London-based architect Will Alsop. The building is described as ''color-spattered,'' and indeed it would be a lively touch against the bland office towers in London's Docklands complex.</p>
        <p>But placed in the Hudson Valley the design is a monstrosity. The shape is awkward. The polychrome surface treatment is trivial and unrelated to the former powerhouse at its base. The scale is hideously out of proportion with the landscape.</p>
        <p>After more than a century of industrial misuse of our shoreline, current planners seem determined to replace one blight with another. Mr. Alsop's proposal has the virtue of being ''green'' architecture, but a building need not be outrageous and oversized to be environmentally sound or original.</p>
        <p>Michelle Jacobs  Yonkers</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Yonkers is poised as bait for developers with a buck in their pocket but who want to earn three at the city's expense. Traffic and overall planning theme and coherence are but two of the major hurdles.</p>
        <p>We need to step back, take a deep breath and count to ten. ''How should Yonkers look as gateway to the Hudson Valley?'' should be the primary question on everyone's minds.</p>

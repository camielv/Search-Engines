        <p>The strange relationships that can emerge when two people assume the roles of driver and passenger come into play in the economy-size ''FARES TO REMEMBER.'' This series, which includes seven creakers, charmers and classics, is part of a larger, somewhat dubious centennial tribute to the first gas-powered taxi in New York City, organized by the Design Trust for Public Spaces. (You can read more about the celebration at taxi07.org.) New Yorkers who have either narrowly escaped death by cab or are currently experiencing slow death by fumes may wonder what there is to celebrate about any machine with a gas-hungry internal combustion engine. Those still mourning the Checker may also find little to celebrate.</p>
        <p>Still, despite some capricious choices -- including non-New York titles like Neil Jordan's 1986 British drama ''Mona Lisa'' -- the series makes for diverting viewing. In Mitchell Leisen's 1939 screwball comedy ''Midnight,'' a marvelous Claudette Colbert and a game Don Ameche run amok inside a Parisian cab and out; in Jim Jarmusch's 1991 ''Night on Earth,'' Winona Ryder, among others, helps take us for an engaging spin. Also on view is Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece ''Taxi Driver,'' in which the director himself plays a virulently sexist and racist passenger whose rage seems to tap into a primordial element of the taxicab experience: ''Did you ever see what a .44 Magnum pistol can do to a woman's face?'' No, but I have seen what a New York cab can do to her nerves. Weekends through April 29, IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com.</p>

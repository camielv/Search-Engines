        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>What an odd piece of work this article is, combining a guilt-by-association worldview with a six-degrees-of-separation mentality. From the bishop Richard Kidder in the 1690s to the 17th-century scholar Henry Hammond to the librettist Charles Jennens to Handel ''and his contemporaries.'' Behold! An anti-Semitic conspiracy has been exposed.</p>
        <p>May I suggest a wacky alternative? Handel composed his oratorio not for Lent, as Mr. Marissen argues, but for Easter. He worked with sacred texts submitted to him, just as in the past he had worked with the inane librettos of countless operas now forgotten. This time, however, he was (as he later attested) God-inspired, exaltedly composing a series of arias and choruses within a few short weeks. And the ''unseemly rejoicing'' of the ''Hallelujah'' chorus actually celebrates Christianity's central event, the resurrection of Jesus as Messiah.</p>

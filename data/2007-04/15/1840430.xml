        <p>John Holl reviews Sub Place Better sandwich shop and restaurant in Metuchen, NJ (Quick Bite column) (S)</p>

        <p>The name says it all. While chain sandwich shops are popping up in storefronts around the country, Sub Place Better in Metuchen is the kind of place that satisfies the craving for a really good sandwich.</p>
        <p>It is not a deli and it is barely a restaurant, with just a few tables in the back, but the employees are expert sandwich makers. There is the usual fare, like turkey and cheese ($9.50 whole), or the ''super sub'' with capicola, pressed ham, salami, prosciuttini (pepper-coated ham) and provolone cheese ($8.40). A few sandwiches are named for regular customers, like the ''firefighter,'' a combination of pastrami and Swiss cheese with Dijon mustard and fries inside the sandwich ($9.30). The cheese steak ($8.60), stuffed with fries, peppers and onions, is a worthy version of the Philadelphia classic.</p>

        <p>It is not a deli and it is barely a restaurant, with just a few tables in the back, but the employees are expert sandwich makers. There is the usual fare, like turkey and cheese ($9.50 whole), or the ''super sub'' with capicola, pressed ham, salami, prosciuttini (pepper-coated ham) and provolone cheese ($8.40).

The cheese steak ($8.60), stuffed with fries, peppers and onions, is a worthy version of the Philadelphia classic.</p>
        <p>In a faded storefront between a used-book store and a tavern, Sub Place Better, owned by George Post, has been in business for 17 years. The secret, Mr. Post said, is ''simply giving the customer what they want, because everyone always wants a different sandwich.''</p>
        <p>The bread, firm but yielding, comes from Nino's Bakery in West Long Branch.</p>
        <p>Most people take their sandwiches to go, but the place offers a free side salad (potato, macaroni or cole slaw) for those who choose to stay. Either way, help yourself to pickle slices from the bucket on the counter, get a soft drink from the cooler and round off the meal with a bag of Cape Cod potato chips (99 cents).</p>
        <p>Sub Place Better, 166 Main Street, Metuchen; (732) 906-1262. Open Monday to Saturday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>

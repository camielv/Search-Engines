        <p>The Rev. Al Sharpton has been given police protection after receiving death threats in response to his push to have Don Imus fired for making offensive remarks, the New York Police Department said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The most disturbing call came yesterday morning during Mr. Sharpton's radio show on WLIB-AM, said Charlie King, acting executive director of Mr. Sharpton's National Action Network.</p>
        <p>''Someone called into the radio program and said, 'I'm going to hunt Reverend Sharpton down and shoot him like an animal,' '' Mr. King said. The call was not taken live and was not played on the air, but staff members notified the police after the caller hung up, Mr. King said.</p>
        <p>Mr. King said that Mr. Sharpton began receiving menacing e-mail messages and phone calls on Monday, after Mr. Imus appeared on Mr. Sharpton's radio show to apologize for making a racist and sexist remark about the Rutgers University women's basketball team.</p>
        <p>The number of threats escalated until dozens were coming in by week's end. The threats peaked on Friday, Mr. King said, the day after CBS canceled the ''Imus in the Morning'' radio program, and two days after Mr. Imus's TV simulcast was dropped by MSNBC.</p>
        <p>In addition to the police protection, Mr. King said that Mr. Sharpton had hired extra security, but that neither the police nor Mr. King would give details of the increased measures.</p>
        <p>Mr. King said that Mr. Sharpton was concerned for his safety but that he would not alter his schedule.</p>

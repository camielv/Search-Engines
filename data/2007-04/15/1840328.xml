        <p>Hard, brittle beats. Noisy new-wave grooves. A preening, party-obsessed lead singer. In many ways the duo GHOSTLAND OBSERVATORY from Austin, Tex., seems like an old-fashioned band, eager to recreate the sights and sounds of an earlier era. In this case that earlier era is 2002. Back then partyers and journalists were talking about a playful club scene sometimes known as electroclash, although the term came to be used as a punch line: a ridiculous name for a ridiculous scene that seemed to disappear as soon as it (noisily) arrived. But like many ridiculous pop-culture phenomena before it, electroclash has proved remarkably durable. The demand for danceable new music is, as economists would say, inelastic, and Ghostland Observatory has figured out a way -- hammy but apparently effective -- to satisfy it. The duo has built a cult following the even-older-fashioned way: through raucous live shows. Expect one Wednesday night at the Bowery Ballroom. 8 p.m., 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door.</p>
        <p>On Thursday and Friday nights, a different kind of dance party: HOT CHIP, a British band with a knack for creating moody and wriggly electronic tracks; thanks in part to some memorable music videos the group has found an American following that ranges from house-music connoisseurs to indie-rock purists. 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; Thursday, $22 in advance, $25 at the door; Friday, sold out.</p>

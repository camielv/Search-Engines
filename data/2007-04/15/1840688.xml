        <p>Re ''A First-Class Response to a Second-Class Put-Down,'' April 11: Selena Roberts misses a crucial point in her otherwise prescient analysis of sexism in sports. She cites examples in professional sports in which terms like ''queen'' and ''Mary'' have been used, yet these have as much to do with the denigration of gay men, to whom these terms often refer, as they do with women. Sadly, homophobia and sexism go hand in hand.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Selena Roberts aptly criticizes those who mock the vulnerable rather than take on someone their own size. She is right to condemn bullies. As Benedick says in ''Much Ado About Nothing,'' ''In a false quarrel there is no true valor.''</p>

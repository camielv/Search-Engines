        <p>DELIRIUM</p>
        <p>By Laura Restrepo.</p>
        <p>Translated by Natasha Wimmer.</p>
        <p>320 pp. Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $23.95.</p>
        <p>LAURA RESTREPO writes about Colombia, her native land, but she spends a good deal of her time in Mexico, and to read her latest novel, ''Delirium,'' is to understand why. Most of the action takes place in the Colombian capital, BogotÃ¡ -- a city, one character says, ''where everyone's at war with everyone else'' -- at a time when the whole country seems either insane or, perhaps worse, in love with insanity and helpless to change. Although Restrepo doesn't specify the year, it appears to be 1983: ''E.T.'' and ''Flashdance'' are in the movie theaters, Ronald Reagan is president of the United States, and the most powerful man in Colombia is Pablo Escobar, darkly presiding over the vast cocaine empire of MedellÃn. Escobar ''doesn't like being called the King of Coca,'' though; according to someone who knows him, ''he prefers Father of the Nation.'' And ''Delirium'' is about his nation of frightened, maddened children, the Colombia he sired.</p>
        <p>Escobar (who would meet his ''Scarface''-like end, gunned down by the police, in 1993) is only the worst of several terrible fathers in this mournful book, whose narrative is an investigation of the causes of a severe episode of derangement: returning from a brief trip, a middle-aged laid-off academic named Aguilar receives a phone call summoning him to a posh hotel, where he finds his young wife, Agustina, staring vacantly out a window, ''lost inside her own head.'' Aguilar's attempt to trace his wife's mysterious ailment to its source keeps the novel running, at a brisk clip, in reverse, like a detective story. He finds, eventually, not only the immediate trigger for her current madness but also its more remote origins in the emotional disturbances of her childhood and adolescence and, more distant still, in the macho brutalities of her father and the mental debility of a dreamy, delusional grandfather.</p>
        <p>When that toxic past is mixed into the violently unstable compound of drugs, sex, greed and class resentment that is early '80s Colombia, it's no wonder a spacy, privileged innocent like Agustina can start to feel lightheaded, overwhelmed by fumes of dementia. Before her breakdown, she was content to dabble in the tarot and the I Ching while enjoying the financial support of her wealthy family. Though this sounds like a comfortable existence, cushioned by money and magic against the harsher realities of her time and place, Agustina is also a bit of a seer, and that's a misfortune, a curse. In Colombia, ''Delirium'' seems to say, it's best to see as little as possible.</p>
        <p>Novelists, of course, want to see everything, at least in the mind's eye, in memory. What most appalls Aguilar about his wife's condition is his realization ''that delirium has no memory, that it reproduces by parthenogenesis, sparks itself, and shuns affection, but especially that it has no memory.'' Aguilar is no novelist, just a puzzled and adoring husband, but as a Marxist ''of the old school'' he does believe in history, and his inquiry into his wife's madness comes to seem the most ardent expression of his love: he burns to give her back her history.</p>
        <p>That's what Laura Restrepo is trying to do for her lost, crazy homeland -- has been trying to do since her first novel, ''Isle of Passion,'' was published in Colombia in 1989. The restoration of the forgotten, the ignored, the barely known past has in fact been the great project of Latin American literature, the proof of its writers' ambivalent love for their suffering countries. The fiction of Latin America is full, as this book is, of painful recollections, whispered confidences, a multitude of voices testifying (sometimes, it seems, under duress) to the things they've seen and never told. In ''Delirium,'' the voices include, in addition to Aguilar's, those of Agustina -- in odd interior monologues in which she often speaks of herself in the third person and recalls only relatively benign events from her distant youth -- and of her Aunt Sofi, who fills in the more disturbing details. We hear, too, of the unhappy lives of Agustina's mad German-immigrant grandfather, Nicholas Portulinus, and her patient, anxious grandmother, Blanca. And, in the grimmest (and, strangely, liveliest) sections of all, ''Delirium'' gives us the running commentary of a raffish old beau of Agustina's, Midas McAlister, who lines up investors and launders money for Pablo Escobar, and who knows exactly where and when and why her mind slipped its moorings.</p>
        <p>Restrepo -- very ably translated here by Natasha Wimmer -- manages her tricky, time-hopping, polyphonic structure with uncommon grace. Everything in ''Delirium'' flows, like tributaries into a river. And where that mighty stream is meant to take us, I think, is back to that large body of passionate, history-obsessed literature that is (or was) Latin American fiction. Restrepo's techniques in this novel recall the favored narrative methods of the so-called Boom years, invoking the spirits of Juan Rulfo, José Donoso, Manuel Puig and many others: all those orchestra conductors of collective memory who represent, in a sense, the good fathers that the characters in her story so conspicuously lack.</p>
        <p>But maybe you can't go home again, not the whole way. ''Delirium'' is a disconcertingly lovely book, and its depiction of Colombian society at an awful moment in its history (and a few awful times before) is sharp, vivid, utterly persuasive. Yet the novel somehow loses energy as it rushes, backward, to its conclusion. The central idea turns out to be the inarguable but disappointingly ordinary one that keeping secrets can be destructive. Surprisingly, ''Delirium'' trickles to something like a happy ending, and it's hard not to suspect that Restrepo's determination to remain hopeful about her country's future may have cost her too much, made her mute her fiercer passions. (It wasn't so long ago that she was telling an interviewer, ''We are disappearing as a nation.'')</p>
        <p>Weaselly, street-smart Midas McAlister, the clearest-eyed of this story's narrators, appears to have the novel's number right from the start. He says, by way of introduction, that ''all stories are like a big cake, with everybody's eyes on the piece they're eating, and the only one who sees the whole thing is the baker.'' That sounds at first like a shockingly homely metaphor for the complex modernist technique that has served Latin American fiction so honorably in the past and that Restrepo has so diligently and so skillfully revived in the present. But by the end it seems a fair description of ''Delirium,'' which is both sweeter than you'd expect and less nourishing than you'd hope.</p>

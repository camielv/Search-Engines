        <p>Re ''It's Time to Pack Up Those Beanie Babies,'' by Michael Winerip (Parenting, April 8):</p>
        <p>Did anyone think to suggest donating these outgrown toys and childhood treasures? This is the spring season, when volunteers at church sales sort, price and prepare for the spring sales in communities all over the New York area. It is irresponsible to consume and then throw it all away.</p>
        <p>Recycle! All you have to do is bundle and take it to an open door at a church or Salvation Army. Just not to the landfill, please!</p>

        <p>Re ''It's Time to Pack Up Those Beanie Babies,'' by Michael Winerip (Parenting, April 8):</p>
        <p>Did anyone think to suggest donating these outgrown toys and childhood treasures? This is the spring season, when volunteers at church sales sort, price and prepare for the spring sales in communities all over the New York area. It is irresponsible to consume and then throw it all away.</p>
        <p>Recycle! All you have to do is bundle and take it to an open door at a church or Salvation Army. Just not to the landfill, please!</p>
        <p>I have picked up bicycles, toys and plastic playhouses from the curb and delivered them to the neighborhood church. Perfectly good toys. The sale generates money sent back into the community and toys for those who cannot go out and buy them new.</p>
        <p>Good parents set examples for their children. Children do what we do. This ''on the curb'' approach seems a dangerous lesson for the world we live in -- on too many levels.</p>

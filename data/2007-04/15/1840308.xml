        <p>Do you know of any (reputable) Web sites or services that list apartments for rent short-term (a week or 10 days) in Barcelona? I've tried searching but have been unable to find any for a solo traveler. I'd rather not stay in a hostel or a hotel, but would prefer a studio or one-bedroom in Barri Gòtic or Raval. -- Lloyd Miner, New York</p>
        <p>Renting an apartment can be a smart plan, giving you the unique experience of living in a foreign city and perhaps saving money with a cheap weekly rate and cooking in your own kitchen. But there is also the risk of locking yourself into a place that isn't ideal. Sarah Wildman, who has written extensively about Barcelona for the Travel section, recommends the well-organized www.apartmentinbarcelona.net, with locations around the city, a site she found on rentals.loquo.com, which has traveler reviews of apartments to help you check out an apartment first. Loquo was also suggested by one of our readers, who called it ''the city's version of Craig's List.''</p>

        <p>Renting an apartment can be a smart plan, giving you the unique experience of living in a foreign city and perhaps saving money with a cheap weekly rate and cooking in your own kitchen. But there is also the risk of locking yourself into a place that isn't ideal.

Loquo was also suggested by one of our readers, who called it ''the city's version of Craig's List.''</p>
        <p>Another site, Citysiesta (34-93-342-5670; www.citysiesta.com) is recommended by Andrew Ferren, who wrote the recent ''36 Hours: Barcelona'' column. Citysiesta has both apartments and rooms of varying sizes, including studios for one. After you book they will send you maps and helpful tourism information for your stay.</p>
        <p>Before you go you may also want to check out Andrew's ''Affordable Europe: Barcelona'' article (April 23, 2006); it recommended the Hotel Banys Orientals, which still lists doubles for less than 100 euros. Also see Matt Gross's Frugal Traveler column of Oct. 8, 2006, ''Footloose in Spain's Capital of Style,'' for other money-saving tips in Barcelona. These and other past travel articles can be found at nytimes.com/travel.</p>
        <p>And one final tip from Sarah: Look for windows in a listing's digital photos so that you don't find yourself stuck in a closet of a room for 10 days, as she once did with an apartment rental in Paris.</p>

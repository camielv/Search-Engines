        <p>Faced with what it said was an increase in gun crimes in the last year, the New Haven Police Department is considering installing a system of sensors to detect gunfire in certain areas of the city.</p>
        <p>On April 4, officials from ShotSpotter Inc., a company in Santa Clara, Calif., that builds such a system, toured the city to find sites for the sensors. Lt. Peter G. Reichard of the New Haven Police said the department was considering the system for the Newhallville and the Hill neighborhoods, where about 80 percent of the violent crime in the city took place. ''We found about 50 different sites,'' Lieutenant Reichard said, but would not disclose which were chosen.</p>

        <p>Faced with what it said was an increase in gun crimes in the last year, the New Haven Police Department is considering installing a system of sensors to detect gunfire in certain areas of the city.</p>
        <p>On April 4, officials from ShotSpotter Inc., a company in Santa Clara, Calif., that builds such a system, toured the city to find sites for the sensors. Lt. Peter G. Reichard of the New Haven Police said the department was considering the system for the Newhallville and the Hill neighborhoods, where about 80 percent of the violent crime in the city took place. ''We found about 50 different sites,'' Lieutenant Reichard said, but would not disclose which were chosen.</p>
        <p>When three or more of the coffee-can-size sensors detect the sound of a gunshot, the Global Positioning System is used to triangulate where and when it has occurred. The information is then sent usually to a 911 center and sometimes by wireless to police patrol cars. Officers can also listen to the recorded shot to determine further if it is real.</p>
        <p>''This would let us know within 15 seconds where the shot has taken place,'' Lieutenant Reichard said.</p>
        <p>In Rochester, where the system was put in last summer, the police said it was working successfully.</p>
        <p>Capt. Tony Perez of the Rochester Police Department said the sensors usually let officers pinpoint a gunshot to within a couple of houses. ''We've had several arrests directly attributed to ShotSpotter,'' he said, and it also allowed gunshot victims to get medical help more quickly.</p>
        <p>Greg Rowland, the senior vice president of ShotSpotter, said that the United States Air Force, Army and Marines have the system, which was also being used by 17 police departments in the country. New Haven would be the first in the state, he said.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Reichard said that the department was looking to cover about three square miles at a cost of about $1 million, but that it would wait for a final price from the company before trying to get financing.</p>

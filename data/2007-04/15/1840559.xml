        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''More Pieces. Still a Puzzle.'' (Executive Pay: a Special Report, April 8), which described the new disclosure rules involving executive compensation:</p>
        <p>Why did the Securities and Exchange Commission even bother installing such ludicrously tiny windows in the castle of executive pay?</p>
        <p>The castle is still the castle; you need only view the manor to know who is still lord of the castle.</p>
        <p>Labor costs for the rank and file are still viewed as a major reason for corporate poverty, yet very few people see executive compensation as a larger threat. It's time for the common peasants of corporate America to light their torches and to demand real executive compensation reform, before they're driven from the manor entirely.</p>
        <p>Harold Tuchel  Waterloo, Iowa, April 9</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>There is a very simple solution to all the problems regarding executive pay -- and it would also help solve the worsening problems related to income distribution.</p>
        <p>We need a law requiring C.E.O.'s and other highly paid executives to be paid only with a cash salary and a cash bonus. All other items typically included in executive employment contracts -- whether stock options, deferred compensation or retirement plans -- would be banned.</p>
        <p>This change would enable everyone, including C.E.O.'s themselves, to quickly size up their pay.</p>
        <p>Timothy Bal  Belle Mead, N.J., April 9</p>

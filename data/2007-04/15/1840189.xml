        <p>DUNBAR--Judge Gerald J., Civil Court Judge. The Honorable Gerald J. Dunbar, a judge in the Civil Court of the City of New York, died Thursday April 12 in New York Methodist Hospital after a short and sudden illness. Born in Peoria, Illinois, January 15, 1947 and raised in Buffalo, Judge Dunbar came to New York City as a teenager to attend New York University and stayed to become a prominent attorney in Brooklyn before winning his judgeship in a city-wide election in November 2005. Prior to taking his seat on the bench, Judge Dunbar was a partner in the Brooklyn law firm of Tenenbaum, Dunbar and Berger. Earlier he was in independent practice in Brooklyn and Manhattan. His specialties as an attorney included labor law, landlord/tenant law and election law. A lifelong supporter of liberal causes and reform politics, he was well known in Brooklyn as a legal advisor to reform candidates who often challenged the Kings County political establishment. Judge Dunbar lived in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn with his wife Christine Pasquariello, a physician and former attorney. They met when both were students at Brooklyn Law School and were married in 1990. In addition to a bachelor's degree from NYU, Judge Dunbar earned a juris doctor degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1974 and a masters of law in labor law from NYU Law School in 1975. He was predeceased by his mother, Marie Dunbar, and father, Gerald Dunbar. Family and friends are planning a memorial service to celebrate his life.</p>

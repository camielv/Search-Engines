        <p>Scene in Brooklyn's Prospect Park described as young baseball players use wood bats; wood bats may be making comeback despite fact that Mayor Michael Bloomberg has vetoed City Council bill that would ban metal bats in high school games; photo (M)</p>

        <p>IT was a chilly day last week on the baseball fields at the end of Prospect Park's Long Meadow, the kind of day that had coaches yelling after their young players to put on long sleeves. Still, practices for the new season had begun, and the sounds of spring were in the air: somebody heckling the pitcher, two infielders calling for a popup, and the thud of spiked shoes around the basepaths.</p>
        <p>On a line drive over third base, though, a noise rang out that felt unusual, at least for youth baseball -- the crack of a bat. Not the muted plink of aluminum, but the sound of a ball coming off a genuine Louisville Slugger made of wood, like the bats that many of the city's youth players are now required to use in games. The sound, once so familiar on city playgrounds, may be making a comeback. This month, Mayor Bloomberg vetoed a City Council bill that would ban metal bats in high school games, though supporters say they have the votes to override the veto. Many leagues for younger players already have rules against metal bats, on the principle that being lighter, they let batters hit the ball harder, endangering players in the field.</p>

        <p>As the new baseball season begins, young sluggers are weighing their choices between wood and aluminum bats.</p>

        <p>IT was a chilly day last week on the baseball fields at the end of Prospect Park's Long Meadow, the kind of day that had coaches yelling after their young players to put on long sleeves. Still, practices for the new season had begun, and the sounds of spring were in the air: somebody heckling the pitcher, two infielders calling for a popup, and the thud of spiked shoes around the basepaths.</p>
        <p>On a line drive over third base, though, a noise rang out that felt unusual, at least for youth baseball -- the crack of a bat. Not the muted plink of aluminum, but the sound of a ball coming off a genuine Louisville Slugger made of wood, like the bats that many of the city's youth players are now required to use in games. The sound, once so familiar on city playgrounds, may be making a comeback. This month, Mayor Bloomberg vetoed a City Council bill that would ban metal bats in high school games, though supporters say they have the votes to override the veto. Many leagues for younger players already have rules against metal bats, on the principle that being lighter, they let batters hit the ball harder, endangering players in the field.</p>
        <p>If the players in Prospect Park on Tuesday are any guide, aluminum has the voice of youth on its side. For a contingent from the Holy Name Blazers, from the Grasshopper division of the Prospect Park Baseball Association, aluminum was the unanimous choice. Players, in red and white uniform T-shirts, rattled off a litany of reasons.</p>
        <p>''Wood bats hurt your hands,'' somebody shouted.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't come off the bat as good as aluminum,'' added Kyle Powers.</p>
        <p>''It's different for the people with the bat and the people on the field,'' said Jake Busuttil. ''Batters are going to want the aluminum, fielders are going to want the wooden.''</p>
        <p>For Charlie Powers, the team's coach and Kyle's father, the calculus is different: wood bats break, and after one game and a few practices, the team already needed to buy more.</p>
        <p>Even the crack of a wood bat making contact, a sound as old as baseball itself, evoked little nostalgia on this field. ''It sounds just as good with aluminum,'' Jeffrey Fischer said with a shrug.</p>
        <p>Purists, however, should not abandon hope. Lingering near home plate after the Blazers left was Michael Grossman, a third baseman who turns 14 next month. He wore a blue David Wright Mets jersey, though his team is called the Nationals, and he scoffed at the debate.</p>
        <p>''If you're a good baseball player, you should be able to hit with the wood bat,'' he said. ''And it's more natural -- that's the way baseball was invented.''</p>

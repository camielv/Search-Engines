        <p>For today's travelers, iPods are as common as e-tickets. Not only do MP3 players store books and podcasts, they can also translate words and phrases, given the right software. McGraw Hill's iSpeak language-learning series, created for iPods, seems to fit the bill. Versions are available in Spanish, French, German and Italian, with Chinese, Japanese and Portuguese versions coming out this summer. Costing $12.95, each iSpeak is divided into categories like food, weather, entertainment and introductions (www.mhprofessional.com).  Hyatt Hotels and Resorts is also courting the MP3 generation. Treating music like wallpaper, the chain is mixing special Hyatt playlists for two of its resorts and making them available for guests to download. The lobby of the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort and Spa at Gainey Ranch features the smooth vibes of Ive Mendes and Jazzanova, while the Hyatt Regency Lost Pines Resort and Spa, outside Austin, Tex., is playing Texas swing numbers by bands like Asleep at the Wheel. Guests who like what they hear can buy the playlists for $22 at the hotels or through their Web sites, www.scottsdale.hyatt.com and www.lostpines.hyatt.com.  Norwegian Cruise Line is rolling out Nintendo's Wii video game consoles on its ships. Games will include Wii Sports (tennis, golf, baseball, boxing and bowling), Wii Play (table tennis, air hockey and other games) and WarioWare (Smooth Moves and Excite Truck). The game consoles are hooked up to large screens in the atrium and other common areas, so guests can play one another (www.ncl.com).  Volunteers are needed to complete work on the Continental Divide Trail, extending 3,100 miles from Canada to Mexico. Participants of all skill levels and backgrounds are welcome, from cooks to prepare meals for other volunteers, to experienced trail builders (www.cdtrail.org).  The Ritz-Carlton, New Orleans, which reopened last December following repairs and renovations after Hurricane Katrina, is reopening its spa on Monday. It has a new cafe, a fitness center and a retail center. The spa, which has 22 treatment rooms, is 25,000 square feet and features treatments like the Marie Laveau Voodoo Love Massage and the Multicolor Masquerade Facial, above.  On March 30, the Ritz-Carlton, Tokyo opened in a 53-story tower. The hotel has 250 guest rooms, a sky lobby, several restaurants and bars, and a health club and spa. Nightly rates start at 65,000 yen, about $545 at 121 yen to the dollar (www.ritzcarlton.com).  Tokyo is scheduled to get another new hotel in September, the Peninsula Tokyo, looking out on the Imperial Palace Gardens. Plans are for 314 rooms, a rooftop restaurant and a spa. Rates are expected to start at 60,000 yen, or $495 at 121 yen to the dollar (www.peninsula.com).</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''DNA Test Offers Immigrants Hope or Despair'' (front page, April 10) recounts the poignant story of Isaac Owusu, a naturalized American citizen, who can bring from Ghana only one of his four sons to join him in the United States because DNA testing by immigration officials showed that only one is his biological son.</p>
        <p>Despite this devastating news, Isaac Owusu still considers all four his sons and wishes to be reunited with them.</p>
        <p>What does the government decision to define family restrictively communicate to adoptive parents, stepparents and others who know that ''family'' is constituted by love and care at least as much as, and sometimes in place of, biology?</p>

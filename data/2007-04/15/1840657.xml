        <p>INTERNATIONAL 3-16</p>
        <p>Iran's Neighbors in Atomic Push  Roughly a dozen states that neighbor Iran have recently turned to the International Atomic Energy Agency for help in starting nuclear programs. While they say they intend to use the programs for energy production, the United States government and private analysts say the activity is also intended to counter the threat of a nuclear Iran.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>McCain Says 'No Plan B' for Iraq  In a discussion of how he would handle Iraq if elected president, Senator John McCain said that the buildup of American forces in the country represents the only viable option to avoid failure in Iraq and that he had yet to identify an effective fallback if the current strategy failed.  1</p>
        <p>A car bomber struck near a bus station in the holy city of Karbala, killing at least 36 people, including several children, according to security officials.</p>
        <p>6</p>
        <p>Marine Actions Criticized  A report published by an Afghan human rights commission said American marines reacted to a bombing with excessive force in Afghanistan last month, hitting groups of bystanders and vehicles with machine-gun fire in a series of attacks that killed 12 civilians, including an infant.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>A Possible Alliance in Darfur  Representatives of the main rebel groups fighting the Sudanese government in Darfur are discussing a military alliance of Arab and non-Arab tribes in an effort either to negotiate a settlement to the crisis in Darfur or to mount a decisive offensive against the government.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>North Korea Deadline Passes  The first deadline for North Korea to shut down and seal its main facility for manufacturing nuclear weapons fuel expired with no apparent action by the North to fulfill its commitments, while China asked officials in the Bush administration to show patience.</p>
        <p>10</p>
        <p>NATIONAL 18-26</p>
        <p>Battle for Student Loans  In a fierce contest to control the student loan market, the nation's banks and lenders have for years waged a successful campaign to limit a federal program that was intended to make borrowing less costly by having the government provide loans directly to students.  1</p>
        <p>Philadelphia Gun Violence  Philadelphia is in the midst of an epidemic of gun violence that has left the police struggling to preserve public safety and government officials renewing efforts to tighten the state's gun control laws. Last year, there were 406 homicides, most by gunshot, the highest number in nine years.</p>
        <p>18</p>
        <p>Falling Away From Religion  A new wave of research shows that increasing percentages of Hispanics are abandoning church, suggesting that along with assimilation comes a measure of secularization.  18</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION 29-34</p>
        <p>Uncertainty After Corzine Crash  Gov. Jon S. Corzine's doctor said it could take ''days or weeks'' before he was lucid enough to resume his duties after a car crash, and six months before he could walk again. The crash comes at a crucial moment in New Jersey state government and in the life of Mr. Corzine's young administration.  29</p>

        <p>THE Shinnecock Indian nation departed from more than two centuries of tradition when it elected its board of trustees on the reservation.</p>
        <p>Annual meetings for such elections had been held in the Town of Southampton in the first week of April since the elections began in 1792, when the state, which had recognized the Shinnecocks, imposed the trustee system, Shinnecock leaders said. The decision to relocate to the reservation resulted in the refusal of the town clerk to preside at the voting, as has been customary.</p>
        <p>Randy King, Lance A. Gumbs and Frederick C. Bess were elected trustees on April 3 from among seven candidates for the three-member board. Mr. King became the trustees' chairman as the highest vote-getter, succeeding Mr. Gumbs.</p>
        <p>Shinnecock leaders said the turnout, 223 voters, was the largest ever.</p>
        <p>All three trustees have been active in economic development for the Shinnecocks, including their bitterly contested efforts to build a casino in Hampton Bays and to maintain the sale of tax-free tobacco to non-Indians at smoke shops on the 800-acre reservation.</p>
        <p>Sienna Hunter-Cuyjet, chairwoman of the Shinnecocks' new Election Reform Committee, said the reservation's voting procedures were changed in part to lengthen the hours for voting -- to 12 on the reservation from 2 at Town Hall.</p>
        <p>Town Clerk Sundy A. Schermeyer said she declined the Shinnecocks' invitation to preside at the voting or to act as a witness on the advice of Garrett W. Swenson Jr., the Southampton town attorney, who had cited state law specifying that the Shinnecocks' annual elections must be held ''in a meeting place'' in the Town of Southampton.</p>
        <p>''I was told that if I presided at a place outside the meeting hall, it could constitute a violation of my oath of office,'' Ms. Schermeyer said. ''If the tribe wants to initiate election reform, that should well be within their rights, but officially I must uphold my oath of office. If the legislation is amended, I would be happy to participate.''</p>
        <p>When he was trustee chairman, Mr. Gumbs wrote Mr. Swenson requesting Ms. Schermeyer's presence. Despite her absence, Mr. Gumbs said, the Shinnecocks' lawyers had concluded that the trustee elections ''don't have to be in the town's meeting place.''</p>
        <p>''It's not a town election,'' he said. ''It's a tribal election and it makes no difference if the town doesn't acknowledge it.''</p>

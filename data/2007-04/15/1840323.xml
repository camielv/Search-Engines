        <p>LIBERACE, who once said, ''I didn't get dressed up like this to go unnoticed,'' faced an Internal Revenue Service audit in 1968 over thousands of dollars he claimed as tax deductions for lavish outfits he considered business expenses. His lawyers eventually convinced a United States Tax Court judge that his bejeweled, rhinestone-studded suits and feathered capes were not everyday attire their client could wear on the street, and a precedent was set. Preparing returns for actors, singers, dancers and other artists is a subspecialty for some tax professionals, like Scott Rodabaugh of Premier Tax and Financial Services in Manhattan. With the Tuesday deadline looming, Mr. Rodabaugh, a former stage manager and sometime marathon runner, has been busy seven days a week but found a few scarce minutes to speak about the finer points of his job with Steven McElroy. Here are some excerpts:</p>
        <p>Q. Are you going to finish on time?</p>
        <p>A. You know that song ''The Gambler''? You don't count your chips until you walk away from the table.</p>
        <p>Q. Are all of your clients in the arts?</p>
        <p>A. That's kind of how it started, yes, but as your practice grows, people leave the arts, or their jobs expand to outside the arts. So I have a lot of people who started out as actors and then moved into management, or started out as scenic designers, and now they are fine artists or do more corporate work.</p>
        <p>Q. Got any mimes?</p>
        <p>A. No, I've got a whole bunch of clowns though. In fact, here in my drawer. [He rummages.] Where's my clown nose? Here's my clown nose. [He puts it on.] One of my clients, actually he died this year, was a great guy and gave this to me.</p>
        <p>Q. What are some deductions the average person could never use?</p>
        <p>A. The I.R.S. doesn't tell you what you can deduct. They tell you what you can't deduct. So if you're a clown, and you make balloon animals and give them away to kids, balloons are deductible because they create income for you.</p>
        <p>Q. Is there a pounding-the-pavement deduction for shoes?</p>
        <p>A. No. Transportation, though, so your subway fare going to interviews. Each audition is a job interview, so there are some times when you'll do three or four auditions a day.</p>
        <p>Q. What do clients try to sneak past you?</p>
        <p>A. Clothing is the biggest one. Or the trip to London to see theater, that's always good. The ticket, if you're researching a play, might be deductible, but the trip definitely is not. And personal trainers. For that kind of thing to be deductible it has to be a contractual requirement. I had a client who was in ''The Full Monty,'' and in the contract it said that he had to keep his body the same way as it was when he auditioned.</p>
        <p>Q. On Wednesday will you be lonely?</p>
        <p>A. It's kind of like running a marathon and when you get to the finish line you just stop. If you just stop, it's really bad for you. But that's pretty much what happens at the end, on April 18. For the most part you're relieved, because you can take a breath and you walk around going, ''Aren't I supposed to be doing something?''</p>

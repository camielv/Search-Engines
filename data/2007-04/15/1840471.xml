        <p>One glance at any magazine, billboard or department-store window makes it clear: shoppers are swimming in a sea of green. No longer confined to Phish concerts or food co-ops, eco-friendly clothing now caters to both taste and conscience, as major designers find more inventive, and more stylish, ways to love the earth. (Vegetable dyes are so '96.) But companies have different ways of defining green, and many slap on the natural label because it's in vogue. So it's wise to do your research. Here are nine items from brands striving to save the planet, one bamboo fiber at a time.</p>
        <p>ELLEN CARPENTER</p>
        <p>1. The Pasadena dress by Loyale blends organic cotton and hemp in a vintage-inspired design ($185 at Organic Avenue in New York; 212-334-4593).</p>
        <p>2. This elegant Icarus top by Linda Loudermilk is made of lyocell, a biodegradable fabric derived from wood pulp ($299 at Kaight in New York, 212-680-5630).</p>
        <p>3. Vinyl billboards bound for landfills find new life in one-of-a-kind bags by Vy &amp; El, like this hip and sophisticated attaché case ($187 at thegreenloop.com).</p>
        <p>4. Patrol sneakers by Patagonia have hemp uppers, partly recycled rubber soles and a collapsible leather heel, which converts them into a comfortable slide ($85; more colors -- this one is ember -- and a men's version available at Patagonia.com).</p>
        <p>5. For every purchase of silver bangles by John Hardy, bamboo seedlings are planted on a deforested island off Bali ($95 each at sustainableadvertising.org).</p>
        <p>6. Mauri Pioppo uses recycled gold for her delicate LiveGreen necklace and donates 30 percent of all proceeds to the Natural Resources Defense Council ($365 at mauripioppo.com).</p>
        <p>7. This pointelle hoodie from the New York company Panda Snack is made from bamboo, a highly renewable material, which doesn't require pesticides to thrive ($84 at Kaight).</p>
        <p>8. These summery, cuffed capri jeans from Levi's Eco line are 100 percent organic cotton and washed in natural dyes ($70 at select Levi's flagship stores).</p>
        <p>9. This itsy-bitsy string bikini by Anna Cohen is recycled, made from leftover scraps of fabric that were used to create Olympic speed-skater uniforms ($164 at btcelements.com).</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 22, 2007, Sunday  An item last Sunday in the Pulse column about bags made of recycled vinyl billboards misspelled part of the manufacturer's name. It is Vy &amp; Elle, not Vy &amp; El.</p>

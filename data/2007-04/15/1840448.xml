        <p>It's April, time for school board elections and budget approvals.</p>
        <p>That's right, only two more days before voters decide all things school-related in New Jersey. This year that date is April 17, and for most, such matters are about as enthralling as filling out a Form 1040.</p>
        <p>''Generally, school elections don't generate a lot of excitement or media attention,'' said Michael Yaple, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association. ''They're intensely local races.''</p>
        <p>That said, Mr. Yaple warned that more attention should be paid to such matters, because those who do vote wield a big cudgel. School budgets make up a huge portion of towns' property taxes, he said. Voter turnout is typically 12 to 15 percent of registered voters.</p>
        <p>Last year, only 53 percent of school budgets passed, compared with 71 percent in 2005, according to statistics compiled by the school boards association. If a school budget is defeated, it must go to the town's council, which decides what to take out.</p>
        <p>Generally, the percentage of budgets approved tracks with the overall economy: the better the economy, the more budgets that pass. In the past few years, budgets have been approved in the 70 percent range. ''If you go back to 1991, when the taxpayer revolt was going on and people were marching on Trenton,'' Mr. Yaple said, ''budget approval was little more than a coin toss.''</p>
        <p>It may not take a lot of votes before candidates are delving into the finer points of shared services agreements. Last year in the Morris County districts of Riverdale, Mendham Township and Victory Gardens, fewer than 76 write-in votes garnered a spot on the board, according to election results from the Morris County clerk's office. In Mendham, one candidate won with 35 votes.</p>

        <p>In a referendum last Tuesday, residents voted 1,097 to 151 to authorize the town to borrow $2.8 million to buy the open land at Powder Ridge and the development rights to that property. Jon A. Brayshaw, the first selectman of Middlefield, said the owner of Ski Sundown in New Hartford had agreed to pay the rest of the purchase price for the ski resort itself. Ken Leavitt, the owner of Powder Ridge, however, said the town had yet to offer a fair price. Neither side would disclose the offer, but both agreed it was less than the approximately $6 million the town had appraised the property and the business to be worth.</p>
        <p>Powder Ridge was one of the state's oldest ski resorts. Attendance ranged from 50,000 to 100,000 a season over its last 10 years. It closed for part of the 2006 season because of a lack of snow and did not open this past season because, Mr. Leavitt said, a legal battle with the town to obtain a permit to open a year-round resort that included a water park at the site had left him short of money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brayshaw said the $6 million appraisal was made when the resort was still open and it did not have the same value now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leavitt said that some of the resort's creditors had filed for bankruptcy on April 6 but that he and other investors were still interested in opening a year-round resort if a deal with the town could not be reached. ''We will look at ways to maximize the property so that every one of our creditors gets paid in full,'' he said. ''If that requires converting it to housing, so be it. But we are not going to go along with any plan where someone pays a fraction of its value and cheats the creditors of the business.''</p>
        <p>Despite the stalemate, Mr. Brayshaw said the referendum was still meaningful. ''We've been negotiating from a position of silliness, because we had nothing to back up the negotiations,'' he said. ''We never had the will of the people behind us.''</p>

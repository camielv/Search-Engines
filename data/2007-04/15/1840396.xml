        <p>Editorial on conflict of interest involving Connecticut House Speaker James Amann for raising money from lobbyists for Multiple Sclerosis Society's state chapter, for which he is paid $67,500; holds Connecticut legislature is rife with conflicts and appearance of conflicts of interest and urges passage of bill that would make state law apply to elected officials</p>

        <p>Until the speaker of the House, James Amann, decided to limit his fund-raising work last month, he was involved in a clear conflict of interest for which he was justifiably criticized. On the side, Mr. Amann has been raising money for the Multiple Sclerosis Society's Connecticut chapter, for which he is paid $67,500. In that job he solicited donations from the same lobbyists who would do just about anything to curry his favor as the most powerful man in the legislature.</p>
        <p>How could that not be a conflict?</p>

        <p>Until the speaker of the House, James Amann, decided to limit his fund-raising work last month, he was involved in a clear conflict of interest for which he was justifiably criticized. On the side, Mr. Amann has been raising money for the Multiple Sclerosis Society's Connecticut chapter, for which he is paid $67,500. In that job he solicited donations from the same lobbyists who would do just about anything to curry his favor as the most powerful man in the legislature.</p>
        <p>How could that not be a conflict?</p>
        <p>To his credit, Mr. Amann voluntarily curtailed his activities and asked the Office of State Ethics for an opinion. He had done this once before; the State Ethics Commission said two years ago that as long as the donations enriched only Mr. Amann's employer, not him personally, his activities were just fine -- thus demonstrating to all why the commission deserved to be disbanded, which it was, and replaced with a tougher state agency.</p>
        <p>Last month, the ethics office issued the right decision, though it was only a draft. Mr. Amann, it said, should not solicit money from lobbyists and, just as important, from the companies and clients the lobbyists represent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amann complains that this opinion raises the question of whether anyone could work at any job and still be a member of the General Assembly. The decision does not do that. But his situation illuminates a larger issue: many legislators have jobs, and as a result the legislature is rife with conflicts of interest.</p>
        <p>For example, for years Connecticut's drunken driving laws were riddled with loopholes in part because defense lawyers in the legislature fought to make them that way. Their legal practices included -- you guessed it -- defending drunken drivers. The Joint Committee on the Judiciary is loaded with lawyers who routinely vote to confirm judges before whom they often later try cases, another potential conflict. The Joint Committee on Insurance and Real Estate includes members who hold jobs in those fields, and whose votes could have a significant impact on those professions. And so on.</p>
        <p>It is understandable that legislators gravitate toward committees that deal with issues they know something about and care about. Even so, these predictable and quite ordinary associations present at the very least the appearance of conflicts of interest, and thus generate public cynicism and undermine faith in government.</p>
        <p>Making things worse, legislators exempted themselves from a state law forbidding state officials or employees from using their jobs in a way that would financially benefit themselves or their families. A proposed bill would make the law apply to elected officials, as it always should have.</p>
        <p>If the bill passes, it is only fair that state legislators get a raise. Their salaries, at $28,000 a year, are not exorbitant, and they have not had an increase since 2001. We do not need a full-time legislature. But we do need legislators who minimize conflicts of interest, and paying them a higher salary will help them do so.</p>

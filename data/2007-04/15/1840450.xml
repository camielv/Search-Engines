        <p>BEAUTIFUL classic automobiles are often called rolling sculpture, but the Phoenix Art Museum has taken that a step further with cars presented as actual sculpture in a gallery exhibition.</p>
        <p>''Curves of Steel: Streamlined Automobile Design,'' which runs through June 3, shows how a fledgling sense of aerodynamics in the 1930s influenced designers to create cars that appeared to cheat the wind. Streamlining was a modernist trend, with toasters, typewriters, vacuum cleaners and even buildings designed to evoke a future of speed.</p>
        <p>''That was how we came up with the idea of looking at the streamline design of the '30s,'' Jim Ballinger, the museum's director, said in a recent interview. ''It was so pervasive in the art world. The actual science of aerodynamics was having an impact, but ultimately, it's the stylization of that.''</p>
        <p>Working with art and automotive experts, the Arizona museum has assembled a collection of 22 automobiles, many of them landmark designs from the 1930s. Later cars in the collection show how aerodynamics developed and was used to real effect in land-speed record attempts, in racecars and in one of the most exotic supercars, the McLaren F1.</p>
        <p>The queen of the exhibition is the voluptuous 1939 Delahaye Type 165 designed by Giuseppi Figoni in what could be the pinnacle of coach-built artistry. The enormous cabriolet seems to float above the surface, surreal sexuality glistening in its gleaming red paint. The star of France's display at the 1939 World's Fair, its presence is no less jaw-dropping today.</p>
        <p>In the Depression-wracked 1930s, the reality was that most vehicles were boxy contraptions. But curvaceous streamlined cars like these embodied dreams of affluence.</p>
        <p>The Phoenix Art Museum is no stranger to rare historic automobiles; the Copperstate 1000 vintage-car road rally has raised money for the museum for 17 years. For Curves of Steel, the museum borrowed the cars from private collections and auto museums around the country. One featured car, a 1934 Chrysler Imperial Airflow, was driven to the museum by its owner.</p>
        <p>The cars are displayed in a stark gallery, each on a raised platform to enhance the sense of a sculpture exhibition. The only extraneous items are captions that appear below each car, explaining how it came to be and its role in auto design. Four automobiles are outside the gallery, the robust teardrop form of the 1935 Stout Scarab greeting visitors as they enter the museum. A rakish 1957 Ferrari 625/250 Testa Rossa crouches near the entrance.</p>
        <p>French automotive art of the 1930s is lavishly represented. The 1936 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic, with its riveted aluminum structure, was a groundbreaking design by Jean Bugatti, son of the company's legendary founder, Ettore. Nearby stands the lush form of the 1938 Talbot-Lago T150C, a rendition of perfection from the coachbuilders Figoni &amp; Falaschi. There is also the sophisticated urban shape of the 1936 Peugeot 402 Darl'mat and the dramatically aeronautical 1937 Dubonnet Hispano-Suiza H-6c Xenia.</p>
        <p>The American cars show how streamlining made its way into production vehicles, with classics like the 1935 Auburn 851 Boattail Speedster, the 1937 Cord 812 Sportsman and the 1939 Lincoln Zephyr, advertised as looking as though it were going 60 miles an hour even when standing still.</p>
        <p>A more down-to-earth vehicle is the '34 Chrysler Imperial, a bold attempt to bring steamlining to the showroom. But despite a shape that looks so interesting today, the Airflow was a commercial failure; many ended up as taxicabs.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the 1948 Tatra T87, a radically finned sedan from Czechoslovakia, had a long, successful run after its debut in 1934.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to do a show on automotive design the same way we do a great art exhibit, so that the exhibit is also a contribution to the field,'' Mr. Ballinger said.</p>
        <p>Phil Patton, a freelance design writer who frequently contributes to The New York Times, was a curatorial consultant for the exhibition.</p>
        <p>The museum is offering a series of lectures about the exhibition and the role of streamlining in design. Information about the exhibition and the lecture series is available at phxart.org or by calling (602) 257-1880.</p>

        <p>The United States Consulate here said Sunday that it would close until further notice, a day after two brothers carried out puzzling suicide attacks near the consulate amid a spate of bombings in Morocco and Algeria.</p>
        <p>With the Moroccan police tightening security around the consulate and other foreign consulates here, the closing underscored American concerns expressed here and in Algeria about further attacks and possible dangers to Americans.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, United States officials here told their employees to stay home, warning that the potential for violence against Americans ''remains high.''</p>
        <p>A similarly strong warning in Algeria prompted an official government protest that American officials were exaggerating the threat and stirring undue fear.</p>
        <p>''They take us for idiots,'' Algeria's interior minister, Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni, told reporters Sunday, according to Reuters. ''Who has an interest in causing panic? It is clear that there is scheming.''</p>
        <p>Some Moroccans, even if uneasy over violence in their largely stable nation, also expressed skepticism about the threat to Americans.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, suicide bombings killed 33 people in Algiers, the capital of Algeria. The attacks, the first large bombings there in years, were aimed at the prime minister's office and a police station, and were claimed by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.</p>
        <p>The day before in Casablanca, a port city and the commercial heart of this nation, which depends heavily on tourism, three men blew themselves up and a fourth was shot dead in a police raid on a safe house in the poor Hay Farah quarter.</p>
        <p>Then on Saturday, the rich downtown, filled with cafes, upscale shops and hotels charging as much for a night as many workers earn in a month, was hit. Mohammad Maha, 32, blew himself up across a palm-lined boulevard from the United States Consulate. About a minute later, his younger brother, Omar, 23, detonated a suicide bomb a few hundred yards away, near the American Language Center, one of a chain of privately owned schools.</p>
        <p>''People were really scared,'' said a waiter, whose boss would not let him give his name, at the American Dream cafe between the locations of the two bombings on Boulevard Moulay Youssef. ''People left their coffee and everyone just started running.''</p>
        <p>The bombings on Saturday caused some measure of puzzlement: the attackers killed only themselves and struck early Saturday morning, when the streets were largely empty.</p>
        <p>Ahmed Najim, a reporter for the weekly newsmagazine Nichane who happened to be in the area when the bombs went off, said he believed that the two were actually aiming for a Moroccan security forces building nearby -- and that something went wrong before they reached their target.</p>
        <p>He noted that the language school was patronized by Moroccans, not Americans. He added that the older brother did not detonate himself directly at the consulate, but across a wide boulevard, and did not pick the time or day to cause severe damage.</p>
        <p>''If he really wanted to blow up the American Consulate, he would have come on a weekday,'' Mr. Najim said. ''It's more logical.''</p>
        <p>Until the recent violence, Morocco had not been struck by a terrorist attack since 2003, when 33 people were killed by 12 suicide bombers. Many here worry that the bombings over the last week may mean more violence in a nation that has been peaceful since then.</p>
        <p>''It has never been this way,'' said Omar Qadir, 45, who was in a small supermarket around the corner from the American Consulate. ''But now the country is opening up to things that we don't know about.''</p>
        <p>For months, Moroccan security forces have been working to dismantle what they say is a terrorist cell aimed not at foreigners but at infrastructure like the port and police stations. On Thursday, the police said that they had arrested the head of that group and his deputy, who were on the run after Tuesday's explosions.</p>
        <p>The connections among the bombers have not been fully explained publicly, but one of the men who died Tuesday was reportedly the brother of a man who detonated himself, apparently accidentally, in a cybercafe here on March 11.</p>
        <p>There have also been news media reports that Omar Maha, the younger of the bombers on Saturday, had been sought in connection with that group.</p>
        <p>In the working-poor neighborhood of Derb Sultan, the dead brothers' sister, Khadija, described her brothers -- one of whom sold electronics, the other who printed T-shirts -- as ''normal,'' and not unusually religious. She said they were not acting suspiciously when they left the house on Saturday morning.</p>
        <p>''My heart is broken to lose two brothers at once,'' she said. ''Obviously someone manipulated them.''</p>

        <p>Negotiations between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and one of its largest tenants stalled on Friday, raising the likelihood that a deal to hand over control of a Staten Island terminal might fall through. And if the tug-of-war escalates, development in the area could be at risk, the tenant's officials said.</p>
        <p>Last month, the Port Authority asked Orient Overseas International Limited, which operates the Howland Hook terminal on Staten Island, to pay $37 million before the authority would approve the sale of its lease to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board for roughly $470 million. The authority also wants Ontario Teachers to agree to invest $17 million in the terminal.</p>

        <p>Negotiations between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and one of its largest tenants stalled on Friday, raising the likelihood that a deal to hand over control of a Staten Island terminal might fall through. And if the tug-of-war escalates, development in the area could be at risk, the tenant's officials said.</p>
        <p>Last month, the Port Authority asked Orient Overseas International Limited, which operates the Howland Hook terminal on Staten Island, to pay $37 million before the authority would approve the sale of its lease to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board for roughly $470 million. The authority also wants Ontario Teachers to agree to invest $17 million in the terminal.</p>
        <p>Orient Overseas said the authority did not respond to its counteroffer of $5 million and does not want to work against itself by making another one.</p>
        <p>The authority said the company's $5 million offer was not in good faith and that even the $37 million fee would cover only about one-third of the money the authority has spent improving the terminal while the company has been there. In February, the authority successfully negotiated for $50 million in fees and commitments from A.I.G. Global Investment Group, which bought the rights to run Port Newark terminal from DP World, a Dubai-based operator. That was well below the $84 million the authority initially sought.</p>
        <p>Like executives at A.I.G., representatives of Orient Overseas called the authority's demands very shortsighted and a potential deal breaker. If Orient Overseas' lease deal falls through, development might stall at one of the fastest growing ports in the region, and Staten Island's economy, which has benefited from Howland Hook's revival, could be dealt a blow, company officials said.</p>
        <p>''The terminal is not going to close,'' said Jim Devine, chief executive of New York Container Terminal, which runs the port on behalf of Orient Overseas. ''But we're not going to dramatically grow and the economic engine will not grow. The capacity of the harbor is going to be challenged.''</p>
        <p>While Howland Hook is smaller than ports in Newark and Elizabeth, New York Container Terminal has opened a rail link to New Jersey and is planning a new shipping berth that would double the capacity of the terminal. The company has also agreed to handle some waste as part of New York City's garbage disposal plan.</p>
        <p>The authority said it was only trying to protect public money. Part of the money Orient Overseas will get from selling its lease is based on the agency's investment in the terminal, authority officials said. And unlike Orient Overseas, a shipping conglomerate, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board has never run ports. The authority wants the $17 million commitment as a hedge against the possibility that the lease was simply resold for a quick profit.</p>
        <p>''We are just looking for some level of commitment that there will be a priority to this investment,'' said Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of the Port Authority.</p>

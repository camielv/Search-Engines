        <p>Chalk it up to spring fever. In recent weeks, the Capitol hallways have echoed with unlikely chatter about who might succeed Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, right, though Mr. Silver has shown no interest in voluntary retirement and little vulnerability to the forced kind.

        <p>Some published reports have Richard L. Brodsky, an outspoken and ambitious Westchester assemblyman who made a bid for the state comptroller's job this year, angling for Mr. Silver's post. Mr. Brodsky called the reports ''silliness of the highest order.''</p>

        <p>Chalk it up to spring fever. In recent weeks, the Capitol hallways have echoed with unlikely chatter about who might succeed Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, right, though Mr. Silver has shown no interest in voluntary retirement and little vulnerability to the forced kind. (He put down a coup once before, in 2000, led by Michael J. Bragman, now a former assemblyman.)</p>
        <p>Some published reports have Richard L. Brodsky, an outspoken and ambitious Westchester assemblyman who made a bid for the state comptroller's job this year, angling for Mr. Silver's post. Mr. Brodsky called the reports ''silliness of the highest order.''</p>
        <p>''I've done nothing differently than I've always done, for better or worse, in terms of speaking my mind and being willing to defend things I think need defending,'' he added. ''I supported Shelly for speaker, and I still do. There's nothing to this stuff at all.''</p>
        <p>Also making the rounds is talk that Joseph R. Lentol, a long-serving assemblyman and dean of the Brooklyn delegation, is being promoted by some fellow Brooklyn Assembly members as a Silver successor. Reached by phone, Mr. Lentol said he was ''not actively seeking the position'' and had no plans to do so.</p>
        <p>''There is a sitting speaker,'' he said. ''I don't think there's anyone, including Mr. Brodsky, for all the fanfare, who is looking to take out the speaker.''</p>
        <p>Not that he would not be interested. ''Members do look to me for advice,'' he said, ''and I hope that they would think of me as a possible leader, should that opportunity ever arise.''</p>

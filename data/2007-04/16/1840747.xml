        <p>MORE MIDDLE-CLASS AUDITS -- Since 2000, authorities at the Internal Revenue Service have nearly tripled audits of tax returns filed by people making $25,000 to $100,000 as part of a broad change in audit strategy. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>SALLIE MAE UNDER SIEGE -- Sallie Mae, the nation's largest provider of student loans, is under siege on several fronts, political and financial. Its stock is sagging and at least two private equity buyers are in talks to acquire the company. [C1.]</p>
        <p>TAKING A MAGAZINE RISK -- Skepticism abounded when Condé Nast announced in September 2005 that it was starting a business magazine, Portfolio, at a time when many others were foundering. S. I. Newhouse, Condé Nast's chairman, said that Portfolio could be the company's last big investment in a new print publication, but as for any doubts, he said: ''Damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead.'' [C1.]</p>
        <p>HEALTH ON THE WEB -- Stephen M. Case, the America Online founder who oversaw an ill-fated merger with Time Warner before he left in 2003, says the time is ripe for a dominant health care brand -- one that could be as powerful as Starbucks in latte or Nike in fitness. [C1.]</p>
        <p>EASY E-MAIL BY PHONE -- Nicholas Fodor, a French computer programmer, will soon introduce Freedom Mail, a simple free service that he says will make it possible to view and respond by cellphone to messages sent to almost any e-mail account. [C9.]</p>
        <p>GOOGLE MAKES A RADIO DEAL Google will begin selling advertisements across all of the stations of Clear Channel Communications, the No. 1 radio station owner in the United States, at the end of June, the companies will announce today. [C4.]</p>
        <p>CBS'S STRUGGLE AGAINST IPOD -- Even with Don Imus off the air, profound problems face Dan Mason, CBS Radio's new chief executive. In an industry suffering from sluggish advertising sales, CBS and other broadcasters have been laboring to cling to listeners who are spending more time with their mobile phones, Internet radio and portable music players. [C6.]</p>
        <p>TED FOR THE MASSES -- With $6,000 and some high-level connections, you could attend an invitation-only TED conference (TED stands for Technology, Entertainment and Design) in Monterey, Calif. Alternatively, you could pay nothing and visit a new Web site that offers about 100 of its TED Talks. [C8.]</p>
        <p>AL JAZEERA ON YOUTUBE -- Starting today, YouTube will carry content from Al Jazeera English, the English-language version of the Qatar-based television news station, with guests like Yusuf Islam, above, formerly known as Cat Stevens. [C5.]</p>
        <p>SHOPPING BY TEXT MESSAGE -- A company called ShopText has introduced a system that lets people buy products instantly, using text messages, thus eliminating the need to go to a store or even visit a Web site. [C6.]</p>
        <p>CASUALTY COUNTS ONLINE -- The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are the first with significant United States military casualties to take place in the Internet age. And while there have been debates over how much public attention to give members of the military who have been killed in combat, a string of Web sites has plunged ahead. [C4.]</p>
        <p>TECH ADVANCE AT INTEL -- At its Intel Developer Forum in Bejing this week -- the first to be held in China -- Intel is planning to announce several technology advances, including one that could lead to a new class of wireless hand-held computer. [C4.]</p>

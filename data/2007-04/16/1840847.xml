        <p>A rare spring northeaster masquerading as a classic winter storm roared up the coast and across the New York region and the Northeast yesterday with bullying winds and torrential rains that flooded shorelines and rivers, disrupted travel, brought down power lines and washed out Sunday plans for millions of people.</p>
        <p>The storm -- a globular nebula 800 miles across that reached from the Carolinas to New England -- inundated many low-lying roads, set rainfall records, canceled flights, closed businesses and ballparks and prompted evacuations, National Guard patrols and warnings to ships at sea. By midnight, 7.46 inches had fallen in Central Park, making yesterday the second wettest day there since recordkeeping began in 1869.</p>

        <p>A rare spring northeaster masquerading as a classic winter storm roared up the coast and across the New York region and the Northeast yesterday with bullying winds and torrential rains that flooded shorelines and rivers, disrupted travel, brought down power lines and washed out Sunday plans for millions of people.</p>
        <p>The storm -- a globular nebula 800 miles across that reached from the Carolinas to New England -- inundated many low-lying roads, set rainfall records, canceled flights, closed businesses and ballparks and prompted evacuations, National Guard patrols and warnings to ships at sea. By midnight, 7.46 inches had fallen in Central Park, making yesterday the second wettest day there since recordkeeping began in 1869.</p>
        <p>Invading the New York area before dawn with pounding wind and rain, the storm sent tides surging against coastal beaches and riverfront communities, forced the cancellation of more than 500 flights at the three major airports, closed 20 roads in New Jersey and others in New York, cut off power to 18,500 customers in three states and tore off a roof at an apartment complex on Long Island.</p>
        <p>By late afternoon, rainfall records were toppling all over the region. The Central Park total was second only to the 8.28 inches that fell there on Sept. 23, 1882. The previous record for the date -- 1.82 inches -- was erased early in the day. At La Guardia Airport, 6.5 inches fell, surpassing the 1.64 inches of 1990, and at Kennedy International Airport, 2.2 inches was recorded, topping the previous record of 1.84.</p>
        <p>Other records that fell by 5 p.m. were in Philadelphia, with 3.36 inches (1 inch in 1906); Trenton, with 3.08 (1.3 in 1906); and Reagan National Airport in Washington, with 2.53 (1.94 in 1983).</p>
        <p>Wind gusts of up to 48 miles an hour were clocked at Kennedy. The highest wind hit 71 miles an hour at Charleston, S.C., the National Weather Service said. Before tapering off today, the storm was expected to have dropped more than 4 inches of rain across the region, as well as a foot or more of snow in parts of upstate New York and northern New England.</p>
        <p>Coming on a weekend, the storm had a relatively light impact on most residents. Many shops and restaurants that normally would have been open yesterday were shuttered, but without jobs or schools to attend, many people spent the day indoors with the Sunday papers, relaxing with music to go with the silken lash of rain hissing at the windows, dripping on a lazy afternoon.</p>
        <p>The day was, in a way, like great theater: the drama of the approaching storm, the searching wind at the panes and rain dancing on the pavement, the smudged sky, the iron-gray day like a movie in black and white. The overcast was solid, great plates of corrugated iron fused from horizon to horizon, and the streets glistened in the rain: a metallic futureworld.</p>
        <p>Today was expected to be normal for most commuters, though the Long Island Rail Road said last night that it was expecting some delays and diversions. Forecasters said showers would linger, but the storm's worst had gone and temperatures were expected to hover in the 40s. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg urged commuters to take mass transit today. It was a different story yesterday. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported flight delays of up to seven hours at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International Airports, and said that airlines had canceled more than 500 flights, including some scheduled for today. Railroads ran with delays but, aside from a brief shutdown on two Metro-North lines, no major disruptions. But many roads and streets ran like millraces.</p>
        <p>In Westchester County, flooding forced the closing of sections of the Cross County, Saw Mill River, Bronx River, Taconic and Hutchinson River Parkways, and officials in Mamaroneck ordered 20 families to evacuate two gated waterfront communities on Long Island Sound. Other families in the Washingtonville neighborhood were voluntarily evacuated to a shelter in a high school.</p>
        <p>In Nassau County, the Wantagh and Ocean Parkways were partly closed yesterday as a result of flooding, along with secondary roads in Glenhead and Syosset. Jim Callahan, the county commissioner of emergency management, voiced concern about high tides in Freeport, Long Beach, Bayville Centre Island and Glen Cove. Bayville had asked residents to evacuate voluntarily, but few people showed up at a shelter.</p>
        <p>In Patchogue, in Suffolk County, high winds ripped the roof off a building in the Fairfield Apartments, and eight families were moved to another building in the complex, said Joe Williams, commissioner of the county's office of emergency management.</p>
        <p>On Fire Island, where winds up to 50 miles an hour howled in from the ocean, more than 1,000 people voluntarily evacuated Saturday night and yesterday morning, about 50 taking the last ferry to Bay Shore at 9:20 a.m. before the ferry was shut down for the day. The Islip town supervisor, Phil Nolan, toured the island in the morning and said that fewer than 200 residents had chosen to remain.</p>
        <p>In the Rockaways, traffic lights and lamp stanchions swung wildly along Shore Front Parkway, and an occasional garbage can rolled along the Boardwalk, which was deserted except for a flock of ducks that sipped from puddles in a playground. Street signs trembled and waves lapped at the top of a retaining wall separating Beach Channel Drive from Jamaica Bay.</p>
        <p>Gov. Eliot Spitzer put 3,200 National Guard members on alert for deployment into areas of New York that were affected by the storm. State crews west of Albany were getting snowplows out of storage.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, Richard J. Codey, the acting governor, urged residents to stay indoors, and at a late afternoon news conference said major highways had been partly or fully closed. Col. Joseph R. Fuentes, the state police commander, said, ''Every major river in the state is going to achieve flood stage or just over.''</p>
        <p>Hundreds of car accidents were reported across the region. The rain by late yesterday had created a pond several feet deep on a service road along Route 495 East, the New Jersey approach to the Lincoln Tunnel. A red Subaru was half-submerged, a woman still at the wheel. Nearby, two men talked after their cars collided; one took a picture of the other's license plate.</p>
        <p>It might have been worse, one meteorologist noted. ''Thankfully, it's not in the winter,'' said Jim DeCarufel, a National Weather Service spokesman in Sterling, Va., who said more than 3 inches of rain fell in the Baltimore area between midnight and 1 p.m. ''If this was snow, we'd be in trouble. It would be a blizzard.''</p>
        <p>All along the East Coast, boats were secured against pounding tidal surges, and the Coast Guard warned mariners at sea to head for port because wind-driven waves were soaring to 18 to 26 feet -- as tall as a two-story house. New York Harbor was a vast field of whitecaps, and on the coasts of New Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut, the waves thundered on the beaches.</p>
        <p>In Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., Marie Doherty, who has lived on the beach since 1977, said she was not worried about the storm. Her home, separated from the ocean by a big dune, had been flooded only once, in 1992. Storms make things exciting, she said. ''It's really the fun of living here,'' she said, standing on her porch as she watched two giant black waves crash on the beach. ''I would hate to be cooped up in an apartment in the city.''</p>
        <p>The storm rained out Major League Baseball in the Northeast on a day when teams were to mark the 60th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's breaking the color line.</p>
        <p>In Massachusetts, where the storm was expected to diminish today, Boston and Lexington canceled events including re-enactments of Paul Revere's ride and parades to mark today's Patriot's Day holiday, which commemorates the Revolutionary War battles of Lexington and Concord. But there were no plans to cancel the 111th Boston Marathon.</p>
        <p>Power failures affected 3,400 Con Edison customers in Westchester County and New York City, 4,500 Long Island Power Authority customers, 4,000 Public Service Electric and Gas customers in New Jersey and 6,600 customers of the Connecticut Light and Power Company, the utilities reported.</p>
        <p>At least two people were killed in car accidents attributed to the weather in Connecticut and northern New York.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, one person was reported killed in South Carolina yesterday as dozens of mobile homes were hit by high winds, and two people were missing in flash floods in West Virginia. Earlier, the storm had been blamed for five deaths in Kansas and Texas, and had spawned tornadoes in Florida and Alabama.</p>
        <p>Tracked by forecasters who compared it to a 1992 storm that killed six people in the New York region and gouged beaches, damaged homes and disrupted life for days, yesterday's blow was a genuine northeaster, churning counterclockwise up the coast, gathering strength from the Atlantic and hurling it at the land. But experts said it was the kind of storm more typical of winter.</p>
        <p>''This storm has the traditional path and makeup of a winter northeaster,'' said Jeff Warner, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University. ''But it doesn't have the cold air traditional with a winter storm. This is going to be a rainstorm, although there will be some snow inland and some pretty good snow in the Adirondacks and other places in upstate New York.''</p>

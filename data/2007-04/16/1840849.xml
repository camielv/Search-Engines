        <p>The driver of a 2004 Acura was killed early yesterday after he lost control of his car, which went over a guardrail on the Bronx River Parkway and fell onto a parked truck, the police said. The police and the driver's uncle identified the man as Rabindranath Ramjanack, 22, of Mount Vernon. A passenger, whose name was not released, crawled from the car and was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, where he was in serious condition last evening, the police said. The police said that the roads were wet, but that they were unclear as to what caused the driver to lose control. The accident occurred about 1 a.m. on the parkway near East 233rd Street. The Acura went over a guardrail on the right shoulder, landing on a Metro-North truck, then rolling off to the ground.</p>

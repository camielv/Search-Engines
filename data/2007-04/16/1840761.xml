        <p>Vice President Dick Cheney said in an interview broadcast Sunday that Congressional Democrats were irresponsible for using a war spending bill to set a timetable for withdrawing troops from Iraq. He said he was ''willing to bet'' that the Democrats would eventually cave in to President Bush's demands for legislation with no strings attached.</p>
        <p>''I think the Congress will pass clean legislation,'' Mr. Cheney said in the interview broadcast on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' adding, ''I do believe that positions that the Democratic leaders have taken, to a large extent now, are irresponsible.''</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Vice President Dick Cheney said in an interview broadcast Sunday that Congressional Democrats were irresponsible for using a war spending bill to set a timetable for withdrawing troops from Iraq. He said he was ''willing to bet'' that the Democrats would eventually cave in to President Bush's demands for legislation with no strings attached.</p>
        <p>''I think the Congress will pass clean legislation,'' Mr. Cheney said in the interview broadcast on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' adding, ''I do believe that positions that the Democratic leaders have taken, to a large extent now, are irresponsible.''</p>
        <p>In the interview, which was taped on Saturday, Mr. Cheney reserved particular criticism for the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, saying Mr. Reid had done ''a complete 180'' by advocating restrictions on financing for the troops.</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Reid issued a statement that Mr. Cheney had ''long since lost credibility,'' so ''it should be no surprise that he would spend time this morning continuing to mislead us about the war in Iraq.''</p>
        <p>Senator Carl Levin, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said on ''Fox News Sunday'' that the first priority of Democratic leaders was legislation including a troop withdrawal date ''as a way of telling the Iraqi leadership that the open-ended commitment is over.'' If the president vetoes that, Mr. Levin said, Congress will try to approve a bill with ''some very strong, clear, statement about the Iraqis needing to meet their own benchmarks, and consequences if they don't.''</p>
        <p>The counterpunching on the Sunday talk shows set the stage for a clash that is expected to grow even more intense this week. Mr. Bush, who has threatened to veto any bill that sets a timetable for withdrawal, is expected to follow up on Monday with a speech about war spending.</p>
        <p>As House members return to Washington from their Easter recess, Democrats must determine what kind of bill they are going to send to the president's desk. The two chambers have passed slightly different versions, though both contain withdrawal language unacceptable to Mr. Bush. Democrats say they do not intend to strip the withdrawal language from their bill.</p>
        <p>If the president does veto the measure, as promised, Democrats must decide whether to send him a new bill, or to stand firm and let money for the troops run out. Mr. Reid said Sunday in his statement that Democrats ''are determined to make sure the troops have the funds they need,'' and Mr. Cheney predicted that Democrats would not ''leave troops in the field without the resources they need.''</p>
        <p>The president has invited the Congressional leadership to the White House on Wednesday to ''discuss the way forward,'' as he put it.</p>
        <p>But the meeting itself has become contentious, and Vice President Cheney made clear on Sunday that the president had no intention of using the session to negotiate.</p>
        <p>''I think we're trying to work out procedures here, obviously, to get the bill passed,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''If they're going to insist on those bills containing these provisions that were in both the House and Senate bill, he'll veto it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney repeatedly used the word ''irresponsible'' to describe Democrats, and Mr. Reid in particular. In his speech last week to veterans, President Bush also said it was ''irresponsible for the Democratic leadership in Congress to delay for months on end while our troops in combat are waiting for the funds they need to succeed.''</p>

        <p>More than 150 firefighters battled a five-alarm blaze at a lumber yard for nearly four hours last night before bringing it under control, officials said. Several buildings near the General Lumber Company, at Clinton Avenue and Second Street, were evacuated as a precaution, Mayor David Roberts of Hoboken said. The fire started about 5 p.m., and three firefighters suffered minor injuries, Mr. Roberts said. More than three dozen people were evacuated from their homes and taken to a municipal center. The Red Cross was assisting. Residents would probably be able to return home by this afternoon, Mr. Roberts said. The Fire Department asked Public Service Electric and Gas to shut off power in a four-block area around the scene, affecting 1,400 customers, according to a utility spokeswoman. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. ''It's been a very bad day here, between the flooding and this fire,'' Mr. Roberts said.</p>

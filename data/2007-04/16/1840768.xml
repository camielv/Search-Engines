        <p>A previously unknown group in Gaza sent a statement to news organizations on Sunday claiming that it had killed Alan Johnston, the BBC correspondent who was kidnapped in Gaza City on March 12. The BBC said it was aware of the reports and deeply concerned, but emphasized that there was no independent verification of the claim, which it was treating as rumor.</p>
        <p>The group, calling itself the Tawhid and Jihad Brigades, first sent an e-mail message with the claim to a journalist at the Palestinian Ramattan news agency in Gaza. The message said that the group held the British government, the Palestinian government and the Palestinian presidency responsible for the death, and said that its demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners inside Israel had not been met.</p>

        <p>A previously unknown group in Gaza sent a statement to news organizations on Sunday claiming that it had killed Alan Johnston, the BBC correspondent who was kidnapped in Gaza City on March 12. The BBC said it was aware of the reports and deeply concerned, but emphasized that there was no independent verification of the claim, which it was treating as rumor.</p>
        <p>The group, calling itself the Tawhid and Jihad Brigades, first sent an e-mail message with the claim to a journalist at the Palestinian Ramattan news agency in Gaza. The message said that the group held the British government, the Palestinian government and the Palestinian presidency responsible for the death, and said that its demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners inside Israel had not been met.</p>
        <p>But BBC executives said only a few days ago that those holding Mr. Johnston, 44, had made no clear demands. At a news conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Thursday that marked a month since the abduction, Mark Thompson, a BBC official, said he had been told by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, that there was ''credible evidence'' that Mr. Johnston was safe and well.</p>
        <p>More than a dozen foreign journalists and aid workers have been abducted in Gaza in the past year, but all were released unharmed, usually within hours or days.</p>
        <p>The group claiming to have killed Mr. Johnston said it would soon release video proving his death, but hours after the declaration was made, no such proof had been produced.</p>
        <p>Palestinian moderates in Gaza have voiced concern recently over what they call the growth of ''Al Qaeda-type thinking'' in the Gaza Strip. Over the weekend, a Christian bookstore and an Internet cafe were damaged by bombs that were presumably the work of Islamic militants.</p>
        <p>Tawhid and Jihad was the original name of the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's first group in Iraq, before he changed it to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. It is unclear whether there is any relation, in intent or in reality, between the new Palestinian group and the Iraqi insurgent group.</p>

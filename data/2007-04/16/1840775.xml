        <p>This page normally has little patience for people who gripe about paying taxes. But most of the four million taxpayers who owed the alternative minimum tax this filing season have cause to complain.</p>
        <p>The alternative tax is supposed to apply to multimillionaires whose high-end tax shelters would otherwise reduce their tax bills to a pittance. The aim is a good one. But in the last decade, lawmakers have willfully undermined the tax's intent, mainly with overly generous tax breaks for investment income that enable many of the richest Americans to escape the alternative tax.</p>
        <p>As a result, only an estimated 3 percent of alternative-tax payers for 2006 are tax-sheltering multimillionaires. Most people who owe the tax make between $200,000 and $500,000; nearly a fourth make $75,000 to $200,000. In those groups, the most common breaks are write-offs for children and for state and local taxes -- hardly aggressive tax shelters. Yet, on average, the alternative tax has boosted those filers' 2006 tax bills by an estimated $4,200.</p>
        <p>So, there are really two problems with the alternative tax: it fails to catch tax avoidance among the richest taxpayers while ensnaring people it was never intended for. In recent hearings, Congress has focused mainly on the wrongly afflicted taxpayers. But that is the easier part of the problem to solve. Simply making inflation adjustments to the levels at which the tax kicks in -- which hasn't been done since 1993 -- would shield most taxpayers. Letting the Bush tax cuts expire as scheduled would also help. Because of the way tax provisions interact, those cuts cause many filers' tax bills to drop initially only to shoot back up when the alternative tax is assessed.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to the real hot-button issue. The alternative tax should be reformed so that it does what it is supposed to do: make wealthy taxpayers with excessive tax shelters pay up. The wealthier one is, the more of one's income is from capital gains on the sale of investments rather than wages and salaries. Capital gains come with a huge advantage: they're taxed at 15 percent versus a top rate of 35 percent for ordinary income. The lower rate for capital gains is one of the biggest breaks in the code. But under the law, capital gains are not classified as sheltered income subject to the alternative tax.</p>
        <p>The result is that the richest taxpayers get a windfall while the burden shifts to others. That huge -- and hugely unfair -- tax shift will soon get worse. In 2007, the alternative tax will affect 23 million filers. By 2010, it will hit 32 million taxpayers, including nearly all upper-middle-class families with children. Shielding those taxpayers from the alternative tax would mean the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. But much of that would be recouped if tax breaks on capital gains were treated the same as other tax breaks under the alternative tax. Lawmakers have their work cut out for them.</p>

        <p>Bob French  ''Marsalis Music Honors Series''  (Marsalis Music)</p>
        <p>Bob French is the drummer and director for the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band of New Orleans, a dynastic institution dating back to 1910 that is known as one of the oldest jazz band in the world. But this isn't a Tuxedo band record. Produced by Branford Marsalis, it uses a few Tuxedo members who are mostly known in New Orleans -- the trumpeter Leon Brown, the bassist Chris Severin -- with Mr. Marsalis on saxophone, Harry Connick Jr. on piano and the young trombonist Troy Andrews, known around town as Trombone Shorty and lionized over the past 10 years by a forest of local press.</p>

        <p>And so you might have reason not to fall for this record too easily. From a distance it seems too much like something that the city's chamber of commerce would want you to love, complete with tracks from the standard New Orleans repertory like ''Basin Street Blues.'' (Mr. French sings half the record, functionally; another New Orleanian, Ellen Smith, sings the other half, sumptuously.) Hang on, though: Allow it time for the teasing and dragging and thumping to work on you. Drumming in full pre-bebop New Orleans jazz mode, Mr. French keeps things simple but extremely suggestive. Most of the action in his swing lies in snare-drum rolls and juicy bass-drum beats, with the accompaniment of a dark-toned ride cymbal. Mr. Marsalis's soprano saxophone lines are big and full and bracing, almost chuckled out in behind-the-beat staccato; he seems to make a conscious decision to leach anything too complicated from these performances. It's Mr. Connick, still a much greater pianist than fans of his crooning records know, who lets go, playing drawling, muddied solos full of colliding patterns, funk and curious harmony.</p>

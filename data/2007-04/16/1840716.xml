        <p>8 P.M. (CMT) 2007 CMT MUSIC AWARDS -- Jeff Foxworthy, left, who long ago proved that he's smarter than a fifth grader, is host of this country music awards show in which fans nominate and vote on the season's best videos in nine categories, including video of the year, which is chosen during the show. Nominees include ''A Little Too Late'' by Toby Keith, ''8th of November'' from Big &amp; Rich, ''Not Ready to Make Nice'' by the Dixie Chicks and ''Before He Cheats'' by Carrie Underwood, whose director, Roman White, also got a nod. Kris Kristofferson will receive the Visionary Award, given, according to the people at CMT, ''to an artist who exemplifies what Johnny Cash perfected -- a vision.'' ''CMT Insider'' offers a pre-voting refresher course on the nominees at 4 p.m. ''CMT Music Awards Red Carpet'' gives the once-over to arrivals at the Curb Event Center at Belmont University in Nashville at 7.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Travel) INSIDE GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK -- A look at the natural wonders of this Wyoming park, from its skyscraping peaks to its crystalline lakes, and some of the visitors who go there to chill and thrill.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) DRIVE -- The racers keep racking up the miles as Alex reconnects with an old friend after his arrest separates him from Corinna; Winston catches the eye of a dangerous beauty; John and Violet continue their deception; and Wendy tries to relinquish the wheel to a new partner.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) DANCING WITH THE STARS -- Leeza Gibbons sweetly demanded a recount when she was axed from the competition last week for a dull paso doble. Tonight the remaining celebrities -- Billy Ray Cyrus, Clyde Drexler, Ian Ziering, Joey Fatone, Laila Ali, John Ratzenberger, Heather Mills and Apolo Anton Ohno -- get sultry in their choice of the samba or the rhumba.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Animal Planet) DIVINE CANINE: WITH THE MONKS OF NEW SKETE -- Devotion, obedience and fulfillment are three of the things the Monks of New Skete, an Eastern Orthodox order, strive to achieve in their daily lives. They're also some of the traits the monks hope to instill in the dogs they raise and train as part of their religious education. This new series follows Brother Christopher, above, as he uses the resident German shepherd puppies at his 500-acre Cambridge, N.Y., monastery as examples to help troubled dogs become best friends to their owners once again.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13, 49) WARRIORS -- This documentary is the second of 11 being shown on PBS this week in the series ''America at a Crossroads,'' which examines the challenges confronting the world in the aftermath of Sept. 11. This film checks in on American soldiers during 2005 in some of the most dangerous areas in and around Baghdad, and looks at who they are, what they do and why.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (FX) THE RICHES -- The deliciously devious Malloys (Minnie Driver as Dahlia and Eddie Izzard as Wayne) are forced to uphold their promise when Di Di's fiancé arrives at their door. Meanwhile Dale plots a power grab back at the Louisiana camp, and a lawsuit threatens the future of Panco. But is Wayne enough of a lawyer to deal with it?</p>

        <p>Bucky Covington  (Lyric Street/Hollywood)</p>
        <p>Bucky Covington is 29, and he has been a sort of famous singer for about a year. But he already seems to miss the good old days, and his debut album, ''Bucky Covington,'' is full of nostalgia for a simpler time. In one song he evokes the days when ''there was nothin' else to do but think and toss a stone and watch it sink''; in another he remembers being ''raised on cornbread and Scripture''; in yet another he fondly recalls that ''our cribs were covered in lead-based paint.'' Of course nowadays you can't accidentally poison a baby without someone making a big fuss; it's no wonder cribs don't gleam as they used to.</p>

        <p>Bucky Covington  (Lyric Street/Hollywood)</p>
        <p>Bucky Covington is 29, and he has been a sort of famous singer for about a year. But he already seems to miss the good old days, and his debut album, ''Bucky Covington,'' is full of nostalgia for a simpler time. In one song he evokes the days when ''there was nothin' else to do but think and toss a stone and watch it sink''; in another he remembers being ''raised on cornbread and Scripture''; in yet another he fondly recalls that ''our cribs were covered in lead-based paint.'' Of course nowadays you can't accidentally poison a baby without someone making a big fuss; it's no wonder cribs don't gleam as they used to.</p>
        <p>Mr. Covington owes his fame to that most old-fashioned of newfangled reality shows: the indefatigable ''American Idol.'' In 2006 he was the runner-up to the runner-up to the runner-up to the well, he finished in eighth place, expiring (as his TV obituary might read) after a long struggle with Queen's ''Fat Bottomed Girls.'' But he impressed Mark A. Miller, from the long-running country-pop group Sawyer Brown, who became one of his producers. (As it happens, Mr. Brown is also a reality-TV veteran: Sawyer Brown broke through by winning ''Star Search'' in 1983.) And last week Mr. Covington's debut single, ''A Different World,'' crept into the Top 25 of Billboard's country chart.</p>
        <p>''A Different World,'' the one with the ''lead-based paint'' lyric, is a charming little country-rock song, thanks partly to Mr. Covington's gentle but grainy voice -- the vocal equivalent, perhaps, of sepia. This is a proudly formulaic album (from listening to it, you'd never guess it was made by a guy who recently split with his wife of seven years) but generally a winsome one. Occasionally Mr. Covington tries too hard, especially in ''Empty Handed,'' an overheated tale of ambition and amphetamines and body-image issues. But he knows what to do with the light-hearted love song ''I'm Good.'' (It's a simple prayer: ''Lord, just give me this girl and I'm good.'')</p>
        <p>''Carolina Blue,'' the one song he helped write, is the wistful tale of a guy who wants to leave the place he left home for. And in ''Hometown'' he sings, ''I hope heaven's a lot like my hometown.'' Sure he does. But in the meantime a likable album about hometown pride seems like a pretty good escape strategy.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Letter From California: A Late-Night Seminar on Lewis Thomas,'' by Verlyn Klinkenborg (Editorial Observer, April 11), brought back memories of growing up on Long Island during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.</p>
        <p>The threat of nuclear holocaust seemed very real then. Frequent drills would send my classmates and me scurrying into our school's fallout shelter or into the hallways to duck and cover.</p>
        <p>Ducking and covering seemed ridiculous even then, but the prospect of surviving nuclear attack only to spend years in a dark, dank basement lined with canned food didn't afford much solace either.</p>
        <p>Over time, my fear was tempered by the knowledge that the United States was a superpower, that vast oceans separate us from our enemies, and that the concept of mutually assured destruction was an effective deterrent.</p>
        <p>But the attacks of 9/11 shattered these illusions. The oceans failed to keep the terrorists out of our country, and superpowers have no advantage over an enemy who wants to die and has access to weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>This is not the world I hoped my children would inherit.</p>

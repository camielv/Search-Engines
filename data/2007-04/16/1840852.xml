        <p>What's on the reading list of the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno?</p>
        <p>''Spoiling for a Fight,'' the 2006 biography of Governor Spitzer written by Brooke A. Masters, now a reporter at The Financial Times.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno, the state's top Republican, was the governor's principal sparring partner during the budget negotiations, even getting into a shouting match with Mr. Spitzer in the governor's office. Many observers in both parties said Mr. Bruno, 78, held his own against the 47-year-old governor, winning concessions on health care and increased education aid for Long Island, a stronghold of Senate Republicans.</p>
        <p>Why read up now on the governor's back story?</p>
        <p>''He had certainly heard some things about the book, and after 100 days, he thought it would be a good opportunity to get to know the governor a little better,'' said John McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno, right. Mr. McArdle has his own copy of the book on his desk.</p>

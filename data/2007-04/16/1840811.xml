        <p>Bill Carrothers  ''Keep Your Sunny Side Up''  (Pirouet)</p>
        <p>Throughout the new album by the pianist Bill Carrothers, somber lyricism gives in to playful fizz. It happens on ''You and the Night and the Music,'' when Mr. Carrothers fixates on a trilling figure until it sounds delirious. It happens on ''Say It Isn't So,'' which he delivers as a frenzied tease. And it happens on ''I Can't Begin to Tell You,'' during a round of quote-riddled four-bar exchanges with his drummer, Ari Hoenig.</p>

        <p>Bill Carrothers  ''Keep Your Sunny Side Up''  (Pirouet)</p>
        <p>Throughout the new album by the pianist Bill Carrothers, somber lyricism gives in to playful fizz. It happens on ''You and the Night and the Music,'' when Mr. Carrothers fixates on a trilling figure until it sounds delirious. It happens on ''Say It Isn't So,'' which he delivers as a frenzied tease. And it happens on ''I Can't Begin to Tell You,'' during a round of quote-riddled four-bar exchanges with his drummer, Ari Hoenig.</p>
        <p>As the title implies, ''Keep Your Sunny Side Up'' is a bright-sounding album, though there's a sonorous depth to many of its tracks. Mr. Carrothers, Mr. Hoenig and the bassist Ben Street uphold a highly responsive trio dynamic, full of pregnant pauses and casual interruptions. In places, notably on ''Church of the Open Air'' -- the only song credited solely to Mr. Carrothers -- the group reaches for a serene and handsome abstraction.</p>
        <p>There are just as many shadows as sunbeams on the album, though they tend not to make as striking an impression. It's not that Mr. Carrothers doesn't manage melancholy convincingly enough; harmonically it suits him fine. But exuberant interplay is this trio's strong suit, and the best thing about the album.</p>

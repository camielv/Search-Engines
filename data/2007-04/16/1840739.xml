        <p>'Disturbia' Bumps 'Blades' From Top Box-Office Spot</p>
        <p>''Disturbia'' (Paramount), starring Shia LaBeouf as an adolescent version of James Stewart in ''Rear Window,'' captured the No. 1 ranking at North American movie box offices over the weekend, taking in an estimated $23 million. In so doing it ended the two-weekend reign of another Paramount film, the ice-skating comedy ''Blades of Glory,'' which slipped to second place with $14 million, for a three-week total of $90.1 million, according to the estimates by the box-office tracking company Media by Numbers. Third place went to another holdover, ''Meet the Robinsons'' (Buena Vista), the G-rated computer-animated film about a bespectacled orphan, which dropped out of second place on a gross of $12.1 million. ''Perfect Stranger'' (Sony/Columbia/Revolution), the thriller starring Halle Berry and Bruce Willis, made $11.5 million in its debut, good for fourth place, and rounding out the top five was the Ice Cube home-improvement comedy ''Are We Done Yet?'' (Sony), with $9.2 million in its second week. In ninth place in its sixth week with a weekend gross of $4.3 million, the sword-and-sandals epic ''300'' (Warner Brothers) crossed the $200 million mark, reaching $200.8 million.</p>
        <p>China and Russia Act Against Property Pirates</p>
        <p>China, under pressure from the United States to attack film, music and software piracy, put the torch to 42 million pirated tapes, DVDs and other goods on Saturday, Reuters reported. ''Through the act of destruction, we wish to show to the world the firm determination of the Chinese government in protecting intellectual property,'' Long Xinmin, the head of the State Press and Publication Administration, was quoted by the Xinhua news agency as saying. The items that were burned included smuggled and pirated audio and video products, software, books and magazines. DVD pirates in Russia will face more time in prison and doubled fines under amendments to the criminal code on copyright violations that have just been approved by President Vladimir V. Putin, Reuters reported. The maximum jail term for pirates of movies, music and other intellectual property was increased to six years from five, and the fines were doubled to $20,000, while the statute of limitations was stretched to 10 years. Konstantin V. Zemchenkov, director of the Russian Anti-Piracy Organization, said: ''Producers of pirate material will be scared by these tougher new rules, as it puts piracy into the category of grave crimes. I hope to see definite results from this soon.''</p>
        <p>Madonna Is Drawn Back to Malawi</p>
        <p>Madonna, below, is off today on another visit to Malawi, but her spokeswoman said she was not seeking to adopt another child there, the BBC reported. ''She is overseeing the building of a children's health care center,'' the spokeswoman, Liz Rosenberg, said. ''She is absolutely not adopting another baby.'' Last year, under an interim adoption order, Madonna took custody of David Banda, a motherless 1-year-old Malawian boy, who has been living with her in London.</p>
        <p>Tracey Emin Raises a Flag</p>
        <p>The controversial British artist Tracey Emin has unveiled a cryptic new work -- a flag in Jubilee Gardens, opposite the Houses of Parliament in London. Against a background of swimming sperm, the banner, raised on a 100-foot-high flagpole, carries red capital letters that say ''One Secret Is to Save Everything.'' Commissioned by the Southbank Center, an arts organization that includes the Royal Festival Hall and the Hayward Gallery, a showcase for contemporary art, the flag will be on view until July 31. The gallery said its ''flag project offers artists from around the world a chance to stimulate ideas and provoke reflection on a variety of issues, ranging from patriotism and national identity to pageantry and celebration.'' Ms. Emin, 43, above, called the work ''a flag made from wishful thinking.'' Ralph Rugoff, director of the gallery, praised her ''precise sense of paradox and ambiguity in subverting what might be a reassuring formula for happiness.'' Ms. Emin created a stir as a finalist in 1999 in the Turner Prize competition with an installation consisting of a messy bed and used condoms, soiled underwear and liquor bottles from the four days she spent on it.</p>
        <p>Hot Titles</p>
        <p>Here's a winning book title: ''The Stray Shopping Carts of Eastern North America: A Guide to Field Identification.'' It has been named the year's oddest title by the British trade magazine The Bookseller after an Internet poll in which 5,500 votes were cast, the BBC reported. Written by Julian Montague, it attracted 1,866 votes, followed by ''Tattooed Mountain Women and Spoon Boxes of Dagestan'' and ''Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming Into Existence.'' ''We are delighted to reward a brilliant piece of niche publishing again this year,'' said Joel Rickett, deputy editor of The Bookseller. Among the losers were ''How Green Were the Nazis?'' and ''Proceedings of the 18th Annual Seaweed Symposium.'' Previous winners of the accolade, established in 1978, include ''Versailles: The View From Sweden,'' ''Greek Rural Postmen and Their Cancellation Numbers'' and ''Reusing Old Graves.''</p>

        <p>Judge Wendell L. Griffen of Little Rock, Ark., likes to give a lively speech now and then. That may cost him his job.</p>

        <p>Judge Wendell L. Griffen sits on the state appeals court here, and he likes to give a lively speech now and then. That may cost him his job.</p>
        <p>When Judge Griffen finds himself behind a lectern, he does not wrap himself in the tapestry of platitudes that is the typical judge's luncheon talk. He has more concrete and urgent things on his mind, like the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>''Everything I know about right and wrong,'' he said about the war last year, ''everything my parents told me about truth and lies, everything I understand about God, tells me that this is wrong.''</p>
        <p>The state's Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission says that speech and a handful of others may have violated canons of judicial ethics, and it is pursuing charges that could end in Judge Griffen's suspension or removal from the bench. Last month, the commission voted to hold a hearing in the matter, saying there is probable cause to believe that Judge Griffen had damaged public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.</p>
        <p>In an interview, James A. Badami, the commission's executive director, elaborated. ''If you are a staunch Republican and a Bush supporter and have to come before this judge,'' Mr. Badami said, sounding exasperated, ''and this judge has now said some terrible things about Bush and the Bush administration -- and now those people are having to appear before him?''</p>
        <p>Judges have fewer First Amendment rights than the rest of us. But the law on what they may say has been in turmoil for the last five years, ever since the United States Supreme Court said that candidates for elected judicial offices were free to say where they stood on disputed legal and political questions.</p>
        <p>The reasoning in that decision, Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, may well protect Judge Griffen, who is up for re-election next year. And if voters are unhappy with what he has said or with the fact that he has spoken out at all, they can certainly vote against him.</p>
        <p>Judge Griffen, in an interview in his chambers here, questioned whether the job of policing his speech should be left to a disciplinary commission.</p>
        <p>''What we're really talking about is orthodoxy, not ethics,'' he said. ''Orthodoxy about what we consider seemly for judges. Judges are supposed to be seen and not heard. Judges are supposed to be, if not mystical, mysterious.''</p>
        <p>Judge Griffen is courteous and deliberate, but he has a way of infuriating people. ''It's not that His Honor Wendell Griffen is a disgrace to the Arkansas judiciary but that he doesn't seem aware that he's a member of it,'' The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, the local daily, wrote in an editorial in 2005 after the judge questioned the administration's response to Hurricane Katrina in a speech to the National Baptist Convention U.S.A.</p>
        <p>''Judicial temperament is a quality most noticeable when it is absent,'' the editorial continued, ''as it is when Judge Griffen decides it's time to do a little race hustling.''</p>
        <p>Judge Griffen is black, an ordained minister and the child of poor laborers in Delight, Ark. He first attended an integrated school in 10th grade. He is 54 now, and he has seen a lot.</p>
        <p>He has served on the court since 1996, and he loves his work. ''It's like being paid to eat ice cream,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Judge Griffen also wants to speak his mind. He acknowledges some limits. He said he would not discuss pending or impending lawsuits, impugn the judicial system, or make partisan endorsements. ''That's to be distinguished from public-policy-type statements,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Arkansas and the 38 other states that elect judges have made some tradeoffs, as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor recognized in her concurrence in the White decision. ''If the state has a problem with judicial impartiality,'' she wrote, ''it is largely one the state brought upon itself by continuing the practice of popularly electing judges.''</p>
        <p>But Arkansas seems to want to have it both ways. It insists that there are no politics in a political process. ''Right now,'' Judge Griffen said, ''we conduct judicial elections like student council elections.''</p>
        <p>And the disciplinary authorities act like school principals terrified of even the hint of controversy. One of the charges against Judge Griffen, for instance, is that he expressed dismay at intolerance.</p>
        <p>At a deposition in February, Mr. Badami, the commission's executive director, was asked whether ''judges act improperly if they express their opinion disfavoring anti-homosexual animus.''</p>
        <p>''In a public setting, yes,'' he answered.</p>
        <p>By the end of a long interview the other day, Judge Griffen seemed weary. But he said the charges against him had not made him reconsider his attitude toward talking in public.</p>
        <p>''The best ships,'' he said, ''are the ones that stand up to the wind.''</p>

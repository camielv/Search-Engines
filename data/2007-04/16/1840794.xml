        <p>FREQUENT fliers are an adaptable bunch because they need to be. The evolving restrictions on what can and cannot be carried on airplanes -- particularly rules involving liquids, gels and aerosols -- have forced them to find new ways to take what they need to look and feel their best on business trips.</p>
        <p>As travelers on airlines know too well, airport authorities banned practically all liquids from being transported on board after an onboard bombing plot was uncovered in London last August. Since then, so-called 3-1-1 guidelines have been adopted in the United States, Europe and some corners of Asia. These rules let travelers carry on containers of liquids, gels or aerosols in bottles if they are three ounces or less. The containers must fit in a quart-size, clear zip-top bag, and travelers can carry on just one bag's worth, according to the Transportation Security Administration.</p>

        <p>FREQUENT fliers are an adaptable bunch because they need to be. The evolving restrictions on what can and cannot be carried on airplanes -- particularly rules involving liquids, gels and aerosols -- have forced them to find new ways to take what they need to look and feel their best on business trips.</p>
        <p>As travelers on airlines know too well, airport authorities banned practically all liquids from being transported on board after an onboard bombing plot was uncovered in London last August. Since then, so-called 3-1-1 guidelines have been adopted in the United States, Europe and some corners of Asia. These rules let travelers carry on containers of liquids, gels or aerosols in bottles if they are three ounces or less. The containers must fit in a quart-size, clear zip-top bag, and travelers can carry on just one bag's worth, according to the Transportation Security Administration.</p>
        <p>''The one-quart plastic bag limit has science behind it,'' said Ellen Howe, a spokeswoman for the agency. ''Given that there are three ounces or less per canister and a limited number you can put in one bag, it's implied that there's not enough in one bag to pose a significant risk to the aircraft.''</p>
        <p>Most business travelers, of course, just want to get to their destinations without checking in their bags, not only because it saves time, but also because the number of lost bags has surged in recent months, the Department of Transportation says. To adapt to the new rules means taking less rather than doing without, say, a favorite after-shave lotion or hair gel.</p>
        <p>Marcy McKenzie, who works for a technology company and travels both within the United States and to Europe from her home in Minneapolis, has started asking dermatologists and dentists for one-ounce samples of creams, toothpaste and mouthwash. She has also collected empty prescription-drug containers from pharmacists that she refills with shampoo and hair gel.</p>
        <p>''It's orange tinted and has a lock cap so it doesn't leak,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Genevieve Bos, the publisher of the business magazine Pink, is on the road every other week to Europe, the Caribbean and major American cities like Chicago and Los Angeles. She refills small bottles from Aveda, a cosmetics company, with her own shampoo, conditioner and gel or with Aveda products from bigger bottles.</p>
        <p>''It's a total pain, but since most of my trips are two to three days, I can use the bottles several times in a month,'' without having to refill them, Ms. Bos said.</p>
        <p>She also switched to a solid antiperspirant from a liquid, buys the smallest tubes of toothpaste at the drugstore and takes lots of samples when she buys bottles of fragrances at Saks Fifth Avenue. Even then, she cannot fit everything into a one-quart bag, so she often goes without lip gloss.</p>
        <p>A friend of hers skirted the rule by wearing a push-up bra that lacks wires (so it does not set off security alarms) but includes a small pocket for gel inserts. By removing the inserts, Ms. Bos said her friend had enough space to stash hair-gel tubes.</p>
        <p>''I would not recommend it,'' Ms. Bos said, wary of the embarrassment of getting caught. ''That's not the way I want to be remembered.'' (Ms. Howe of the Transportation Security Administration says that gel bras are allowed.) Travelers who wear contact lenses have a more pressing need -- how to deal with the dry air on planes, which makes wearing them uncomfortable, particularly on long flights. Since contact-lens solution must remain sterile, pouring it from larger bottles into smaller empty ones is impractical. Yet finding cleansing liquid in small bottles is difficult.</p>
        <p>Christopher Slaughter, who works at a video production company in Hong Kong and travels throughout Asia and to the United States and Britain, will sometimes fill his contact-lens case so he has enough solution for the flight. But more often than not, he has put his lenses away and worn glasses for the flight.</p>
        <p>The restrictions on carrying contact-lens solution, he said, ''is the best argument for the Lasik surgery.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Slaughter has been unable to take his contact-lens solution on trips to the United States and Britain, he has been able to carry liquids on flights to countries in Asia that have yet to adopt the 3-1-1 guidelines. That loophole, however, is closing. In March, Hong Kong and New Zealand joined Australia, Japan, South Korea and several Pacific Island countries on the list of nations following the rules.</p>
        <p>More travelers have found that avoiding carrying on toiletries entirely is the ultimate solution.</p>
        <p>Take Scott Bastian, who until a few months ago traveled almost every week for a large technology company from his home near San Francisco to his customers in Dallas. Mr. Bastian usually flew overnight on Sundays, showered at the Admirals Club airport lounge the next morning and went straight to his client's office. That left him little margin for lost luggage or shopping. So after the 3-1-1 restrictions were announced, he bought four toiletry kits at a local drugstore and stocked each one with about $15 worth of his favorite talcum powder, shaving cream, toothpaste, hair gel, face lotion and hand cream. He stashed the kits at the four Dallas hotels he stayed in most often, including the Westin and Sheraton downtown and their counterparts near the airport. Each time he checked in, the concierge fished his kit from the storage room with no fuss. ''I have not found a place that wouldn't hold it for me,'' said Mr. Bastian, who has since changed jobs and now travels regularly to Asia. ''They were a little surprised. Usually people leave their clothes behind to be laundered.''</p>
        <p>Some high-end hotels are taking the service one step further. At the Mandarin Oriental in Miami, customers who leave their toilet kits at the hotel can have them brought to their rooms before they arrive.</p>
        <p>''It's all ready for them in their room when they check in,'' said Jamie Atkinson, the assistant front-office manager at the hotel. Some customers ask the Mandarin to shop for toiletries, and some ship their toiletries ahead by overnight courier.</p>
        <p>For those who shop for what they need after they arrive, there is the travel Web site joesentme.com, where visitors can type in the ZIP code of their hotel to find the nearest drugstores.</p>
        <p>''A lot of business travelers don't want to balance one more thing,'' Mr. Brancatelli said. ''There's too much to take through security. One of the things they think they can get rid of is toiletries.''</p>

        <p>More than 40 years after Roky Erickson began his recording career, he played his first New York concert Friday night at Southpaw. It was a set of beefy, fuzz-toned, vociferous garage rock, propelled by Mr. Erickson's saber-toothed rhythm guitar and topped by his biting high voice. He was backed by a band, the Explosives, that made its younger opening acts sound timid. The music was stronger than anyone might expect.</p>
        <p>For years Roger Kynard Erickson, now 59, was one of psychedelia's lost pioneers: a Texan rocker who was in and out of mental hospitals and jails, shattered by drugs and schizophrenia. In the mid-1960s he was the front man for the 13th Floor Elevators, whose recordings -- like their proudly titled 1966 album, ''The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators'' -- still sound tough and wild-eyed. When Mr. Erickson was arrested in 1969 and charged with marijuana possession, he avoided a long prison sentence by pleading insanity. He was sent for three years to a mental hospital, where his treatment reportedly included Thorazine and electroshock, leaving him unstable.</p>

        <p>More than 40 years after Roky Erickson began his recording career, he played his first New York concert Friday night at Southpaw.

        <p>For years Roger Kynard Erickson, now 59, was one of psychedelia's lost pioneers: a Texan rocker who was in and out of mental hospitals and jails, shattered by drugs and schizophrenia. In the mid-1960s he was the front man for the 13th Floor Elevators, whose recordings -- like their proudly titled 1966 album, ''The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators'' -- still sound tough and wild-eyed. When Mr. Erickson was arrested in 1969 and charged with marijuana possession, he avoided a long prison sentence by pleading insanity. He was sent for three years to a mental hospital, where his treatment reportedly included Thorazine and electroshock, leaving him unstable.</p>
        <p>In the following decades he continued to write songs, often drawing on horror-movie plots and thoughts of Lucifer. At times he has led bands, like the Aliens and now the Explosives. Fans from bands like Creedence Clearwater Revival and the Butthole Surfers helped him make occasional studio recordings. But he largely disappeared, living in poverty and squalor. At one point he made a legal declaration that he was an alien.</p>
        <p>Under the care of family members since the 1990s he has improved. (A 2005 documentary named after a 13th Floor Elevators single, ''You're Gonna Miss Me,'' chronicles his descent and his recent resurgence.) Over the last few years Mr. Erickson returned to performing around Austin, Tex., and he is now touring nationwide. He and the Explosives are booked for the Coachella Festival in Indio, Calif., on April 28 and the Ponderosa Stomp in New Orleans on May 2.</p>
        <p>Reappearances like Mr. Erickson's can be dicey, offering only a shaky glimpse of long-gone youthful inspiration. But this performance needed no sympathy or nostalgia.</p>
        <p>The music was rooted in Chuck Berry and the blues -- Mr. Erickson took over lead guitar for some high, stabbing solos -- and paced by the drone and chomp of his rhythm-guitar riffs. His high, jittery voice has always had a quality that's simultaneously brash and haunted. It's the sound of a man plunging into unknown territory with pride and desperation, knowing he might never return. And it still had that raw tone as he sang ''Don't Shake Me Lucifer,'' ''The Beast,'' ''I Think Up Demons,'' ''Bermuda'' (about the Bermuda Triangle) and ''Bloody Hammer,'' which insists, ''I never hammered my mind out.'' The songs were filled with demons, but the music was ready to wrestle them down.</p>

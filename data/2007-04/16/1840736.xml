        <p>What is the Internet's most blogged in language? It depends on the month. English and Japanese have leapfrogged each other in the last couple of years.</p>
        <p>In November 2005, it was Japanese by six percentage points; in April 2006, English. And over the last quarter of 2006, Japanese accounted for 37 percent of all postings, compared with 36 percent in English, according to a report by the blog tracking firm Technorati. (The data omitted password-protected blogs and are known to undercount French and Korean for technical reasons.)</p>

        <p>What is the Internet's most blogged in language? It depends on the month. English and Japanese have leapfrogged each other in the last couple of years.</p>
        <p>In November 2005, it was Japanese by six percentage points; in April 2006, English.

(The data omitted password-protected blogs and are known to undercount French and Korean for technical reasons.)</p>
        <p>English and Japanese postings appear quite different from each other. Japanese postings are often sent text-message-style, from mobile phones, so they tend to be shorter and more frequent. English postings, mostly sent from computers, are longer and more sporadic.</p>
        <p>English postings also occur more uniformly across the day than those in Japanese. They seem as likely to appear at 4 a.m. as at 9 p.m., presumably because English is spoken at many different longitudes. Japanese, Chinese and Italian posts, by contrast, dip sharply at certain hours. ''When people are sleeping in Italy,'' said David L. Sifry, Technorati's founder, ''the number of Italian posts is going to go down.''</p>

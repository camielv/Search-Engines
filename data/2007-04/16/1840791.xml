        <p>The top 10 candidates for the 133rd Kentucky Derby on May 5 at Churchill Downs in Louisville. Horses are listed in order of preference.</p>
        <p>By JOE DRAPE</p>
        <p>HORSE: 1. Nobiz Like Shobiz  TRAINER: Barclay Tagg  JOCKEY: Cornelio Velasquez  Victory in the Wood Memorial makes him the Derby favorite.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 2. Street Sense  TRAINER: Carl Nafzger  JOCKEY: Calvin Borel  Lost Blue Grass by a nose, but it hardly took anything out of him.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 3. Scat Daddy  TRAINER: Todd Pletcher  JOCKEY: John Velazquez  Hard to argue with the Florida Derby champ. He wins.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 4. Curlin  TRAINER: Steve Asmussen  JOCKEY: Robby Albarado  He won the Arkansas Derby by a record 101/2 lengths and is undefeated in three starts.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 5. Circular Quay  TRAINER: Todd Pletcher  JOCKEY: Garrett Gomez  Louisiana Derby winner goes to the Derby off an eight-week rest, which is dicey.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 6. Cowtown Cat  TRAINER: Todd Pletcher  JOCKEY: Fernando Jara</p>
        <p>Illinois Derby winner is certainly improving.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 7. Dominican  TRAINER: Darrin Miller  JOCKEY: Rafael Bejarano</p>
        <p>Blue Grass Stakes upsetter has quick stretch kick -- at least on synthetic surfaces.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 8. Any Given Saturday  TRAINER: Todd Pletcher  JOCKEY: John Velazquez  Street Sense and Nobiz have defeated him in the last pair.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 9. Tiago  TRAINER: John Shirreffs  JOCKEY: Mike Smith  Late run in Santa Anita Derby victory earned him a trip to Churchill Downs.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 10. Hard Spun  TRAINER: Larry Jones  JOCKEY: Mario Pino  The colt has won 5 of 6, but against whom?</p>

        <p>A man was charged with vehicular manslaughter after a crash on the Henry Hudson Parkway that killed a woman early yesterday, the police said. The man, Joseph W. Harris, 29, of Harlem, was also charged with driving while intoxicated. He was treated for minor injuries at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and then taken into custody. The woman, Gretchen Patterson, 48, of Brooklyn, was pronounced dead at St. Luke's, according to the police. The police said that Mr. Harris was speeding south on the parkway about 12:30 a.m. when he slammed into Ms. Patterson's car near 74th Street, sending her vehicle into two other cars and over a wall. Ms. Patterson's car landed 26 feet below, in Riverside Park. The drivers of the other two vehicles, men ages 19 and 24, were treated for minor injuries. Mr. Harris's vehicle came to a halt upside down on the parkway. Mr. Harris refused a Breathalyzer test before his arrest, the police said. Two passengers, men ages 22 and 23, in Mr. Harris's vehicle suffered minor injuries, the police said.</p>

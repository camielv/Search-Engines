        <p>Iran said Sunday that it was seeking international bids for building two more nuclear power plants despite international pressure over its nuclear program.</p>
        <p>''Iran is launching two international tenders for the construction of two nuclear power stations of between 1,000 and 1,600 megawatts capacity in Bushehr,'' said Ahmad Fayazbakhsh, the deputy head of the nation's Atomic Energy Organization, who was quoted by the ISNA news agency.</p>

        <p>Iran said Sunday that it was seeking international bids for building two more nuclear power plants despite international pressure over its nuclear program.</p>
        <p>''Iran is launching two international tenders for the construction of two nuclear power stations of between 1,000 and 1,600 megawatts capacity in Bushehr,'' said Ahmad Fayazbakhsh, the deputy head of the nation's Atomic Energy Organization, who was quoted by the ISNA news agency.</p>
        <p>He said that contacts had already been made with Russian and European firms, but that with Iran under United Nations sanctions because of its nuclear program, it was unclear if companies would want the risk of taking on the projects.</p>
        <p>Russia helped Iran build its first, nearly completed, nuclear reactor in the southern city of Bushehr. But Russia has since informed Iran that it will withhold nuclear fuel for the plant unless Iran suspends its uranium enrichment as demanded by the United Nations Security Council, according to European, American and Iranian officials.</p>
        <p>Uranium enriched to low levels can fuel reactors; if enriched to high levels, it can fuel nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>The United States and some European governments have accused Iran of having a clandestine weapons program, but Iran contends that its program is peaceful, for energy purposes, and that it wants to produce fuel for reactors.</p>
        <p>Iran also announced this month that it had started industrial-scale production of enriched uranium at Natanz. The announcement was greeted with skepticism by Western diplomats and nuclear experts.</p>
        <p>The Security Council has passed two resolutions since December that impose sanctions and press Iran to suspend its enrichment program.</p>
        <p>The newly announced projects would be expected to take between 9 and 11 years and cost more than $1 billion, according to Mr. Fayazbakhsh. It is unclear if Iran is serious about pursuing the projects or if it is trying to build a better case for why it needs to produce its own enriched uranium.</p>
        <p>The nearly completed Bushehr plant has a 1,000-megawatt capacity. The Iranian government has neither confirmed nor denied a report that Russia has asked Iran to suspend uranium enrichment.</p>

        <p>For a few days every other month, the narrow sidewalks of Tepoztlán, a scenic mountain town south of here, fill with hundreds of women from surrounding villages, many tugging along children by the hand or carrying infants slung at their waists in rebozos.</p>
        <p>They come in by bus or foot and gather in the cool shadows of the municipal auditorium, where government workers sit at tables on the stage, ready to hand out cash.</p>
        <p>The women are participants in an antipoverty program that is a model for one that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans to start in New York City. The mayor traveled to Mexico on Tuesday, joining City Hall officials who arrived two days earlier for a fact-finding trip.</p>
        <p>On Monday in Tepoztlán (pronounced teh-pos-LAHN), they watched as about 800 women waited for three hours or more in the auditorium to go up to get their money. If the women and their children have kept all their medical appointments, and if their children have stayed in school, the money is theirs to use as they wish. The awards range from 360 to 3,710 pesos (about $36 to $370), enough to buy food or shoes or other necessities. The size of the award depends on how many children they have and what level of school the children are in.</p>
        <p>The program is 10 years old, has a budget of more than $3 billion a year and covers almost a quarter of all Mexicans.</p>
        <p>It may seem strange that one of the world's financial capitals should look to a small mountain town for answers to its own urban ills. But since this program got its start in rural Mexico in 1997, it has been heralded by the World Bank and others as a powerful model for fighting chronic poverty.</p>
        <p>Outside evaluations have found that the program, called Oportunidades, has been successful in raising school attendance and nutrition levels. The percentage of Mexicans living in extreme poverty has fallen by 17 percentage points since 1996, when it reached 37 percent.</p>
        <p>Those results have spurred some 30 countries to adopt some version of the program.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Bloomberg's arrival here, his deputy mayor for human services, Linda I. Gibbs, and her staff interviewed local doctors, school officials and scholars who have studied the program since its inception.</p>
        <p>But will something that works for the impoverished of Mexico help the poor of New York?</p>
        <p>''Clearly the economies of the Mexico and the U.S. and New York City are very different,'' Ms. Gibbs said as she toured the village's medical clinic, where many Oportunidades recipients go for their regular checkups and medical care.</p>
        <p>''But what the poor have in common is that they are really struggling to make ends meet, that every day every decision is, 'Do I do this thing or do I do that thing?' It's not a matter of can I go to work and get health care; it's often a matter of trading it off.''</p>
        <p>The program pays cash stipends mostly to mothers -- about 97 percent of recipients are women -- on the assumption that they will be more likely to spend the money on their children. To qualify, people must be in extreme poverty, roughly defined by officials here as living on less than the equivalent of $2 a day.</p>
        <p>The payments are tied to changes in behavior intended to lift families out of poverty. So the program requires families to keep their children in school and take them for regular checkups. Parents must also attend talks on health, nutrition and family planning.</p>
        <p>In addition, pregnant women, infants and breast-feeding mothers receive an iron-fortified supplement to ward off malnutrition.</p>
        <p>They also receive small grants to offset the cost of school uniforms and supplies, but many of the women in Tepoztlán said the school grants are not enough to cover the extra costs.</p>
        <p>And there are hardships in staying qualified. Getting time off work to get medical checkups can be difficult. And making the trek every two months to receive their cash typically consumes the whole day. Many of the women, when they can find jobs, work as cleaning women or in the cornfields with their husbands.</p>
        <p>Luisa Rosa, a participant who is a 35-year-old mother of four, also volunteers to help organize others in the program in her village, Huachinantitla, about a 20-minute walk from Tepoztlán, to ensure they keep up with the requirements.</p>
        <p>''The truth is, it is difficult,'' Ms. Rosa said. ''Because sometimes they don't get permission to get off work, so they don't go for their medical appointments.''</p>
        <p>Some in her village have received notices that they are no longer eligible, she says, but that has been rare.</p>
        <p>One woman, Sylvia Hernández-Zavaleta, 47, said the program saved her life. Four years ago, doctors discovered she had pancreatic cancer during one of her required visits to the medical clinic, making early intervention possible.</p>
        <p>''And while I was hospitalized,'' she added, ''I did not have any other income but money from Oportunidades.''</p>
        <p>And as for the time-consuming gatherings, academics have also found value in that. In addition to chatting and gossiping, the women also encourage one another.</p>
        <p>''They become social gatherings and help shift norms,'' said J. Lawrence Aber, a professor of applied psychology and public policy at New York University, who was part of the mayor's poverty commission that pushed for New York to adopt the program. ''It's a form of social capital.''</p>
        <p>Still, there are questions about how much more effective the program can be in lifting large numbers of people permanently out of poverty. The quality of the services they get -- particularly education -- is poor.</p>
        <p>''While they're spending a lot more time in schools, the impact on learning is mixed,'' said Susan W. Parker, an economist in Mexico City, who has studied the program since its inception under the name Progresa.</p>
        <p>And then there is the question of whether they can find a decent job locally, or whether they will feel forced to migrate to the United States.</p>
        <p>That issue bothers the program's principal architect, Santiago Levy, a former undersecretary of finance. At an interview at his home in Mexico City, he said, ''Progresa is a program to improve human capital; it is not a jobs-creation program.''</p>
        <p>Oportunidades will never cure poverty in Mexico without major reforms to the country's labor market, Mr. Levy said. Still, he credits the program as one of two major reasons poverty has declined, the other being money sent home from Mexican workers in the north.</p>
        <p>''When I first proposed this to the cabinet, I was murdered by some of the ministers,'' he recalled. ''The standard arguments were the husband's going to beat the wife, take the money and go and drink, or they're going to buy cigarettes, or people are going to be lazy.''</p>
        <p>That has not happened, Mr. Levy said.</p>
        <p>''The evidence shows that 99 percent of the time they buy shoes for the children, roof for the housing, food, or they save,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For it to work in New York, Mr. Levy says, the city will have to ensure that it can survive changes in political administrations, as it has in Mexico. Another important component of success for the Mexico program was to keep it free of the political opportunism and patronage that has plagued past antipoverty programs, which with a few exceptions they have largely done, he said.</p>
        <p>Under the New York plan, which is still being developed, poor families would be paid up to $5,000 a year to meet goals like attending parent-teacher conferences, getting regular medical checkups and holding down a full-time job. Participants would get their money through automatic deposits, not by attending a large gathering.</p>
        <p>A pilot program is scheduled to begin in September with 2,500 randomly selected families whose progress will be measured against 2,500 families who will not receive the benefits. The pilot program will be privately financed. The city has already raised $42 million of the $50 million needed to cover the initial costs. If it is successful, Mr. Bloomberg hopes that public money will eventually go into it.</p>
        <p>But there is still a question of how a rural program will translate into an urban setting. Mexico began expanding the program into smaller cities only in 2001, and into larger metropolitan areas in 2004. Mexico City was one of the last areas in the country to get the program. In 2006, only about 18,300 residents there were receiving benefits, according to the program's statistics.</p>
        <p>The mayor of Mexico City, Marcelo Ebrard, has been a strong critic of the program, saying that it is too conservative and that at the pace with which it is expanding, it would take two generations to help his city's worst off.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Bloomberg and his staff viewed the program in the larger setting of Toluca, an industrial city of about 750,000 about 45 minutes west of Mexico City, where the women gather in a courtyard outside a bank for their money. Later, he met with President Felipe Calderón, though it is unclear if they discussed the program.</p>
        <p>While Toluca is a big city, the mayor's delegation did not view the program as it operates in a major metropolitan area like Mexico City, to the frustration of some in his delegation. Ms. Gibbs, the deputy mayor, said this was mainly because the programs are not as developed in the nation's largest cities, and because of scheduling considerations.</p>
        <p>Mexican officials say the dropout rate is higher in cities, and the program is more prone to fraud, because families can more easily hide income and household assets that determine whether they qualify for benefits, which could also be an issue in New York.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bloomberg acknowledged that the program might not work in the five boroughs.</p>
        <p>''But shame on us if we don't have the courage to try things which, if it doesn't work, you will describe as a failure and I would describe as something we should be proud of that we at least tried to help,'' he said. ''We should not walk away from any idea that can possibly help.''</p>

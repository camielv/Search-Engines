        <p>The agency in the Justice Department that handles complaints about political influence in the Civil Service will investigate whether the White House has improperly tried to use government agencies for political purposes, its spokesman said Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The spokesman, Loren Smith, said the agency, the Office of Special Counsel, was expanding an investigation that began with reports of a Jan. 26 political speech to employees of the General Services Administration. The meeting involved a presentation to G.S.A. political appointees by a deputy to Karl Rove, the president's political adviser, that discussed Republican plans to win more seats in Congress.</p>

        <p>The agency in the Justice Department that handles complaints about political influence in the Civil Service will investigate whether the White House has improperly tried to use government agencies for political purposes, its spokesman said Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The spokesman, Loren Smith, said the agency, the Office of Special Counsel, was expanding an investigation that began with reports of a Jan. 26 political speech to employees of the General Services Administration. The meeting involved a presentation to G.S.A. political appointees by a deputy to Karl Rove, the president's political adviser, that discussed Republican plans to win more seats in Congress.</p>
        <p>''We have made the determination to broaden the investigation into possible illegal political activity elsewhere in the government,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>But the head of the Office of Special Counsel, Scott J. Bloch, is himself under investigation by the inspector general of the Office of Personnel Management over accusations of politicizing his agency.</p>
        <p>A group of employees who work for Mr. Bloch has filed a complaint saying he tried to dismantle the agency, illegally barred employees from talking to the news media and reduced a backlog of whistle-blower complaints by simply discarding old cases. Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer representing the employees, said it was obvious that Mr. Bloch was trying to use the investigation to divert attention from his own problems.</p>
        <p>Ms. Katz said Mr. Bloch's assertions that he would conduct a wide-scale investigation of the Bush White House political activities, first reported in The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, were not believable because his office had only limited authority in such matters.</p>
        <p>At the meeting with G.S.A. employees, a Rove aide described Democratic seats that might be vulnerable and Republican seats needing protection.</p>
        <p>Some employees at the meeting said Lurita Doan, the head of the G.S.A., asked the aide what agency employees could do to help the Republican electoral agenda.</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 27, 2007, Friday  An article on Wednesday about an investigation into the propriety of political briefings at federal agencies incorrectly described the Office of Special Counsel, the agency conducting the inquiry. The office, which investigates allegations of improper influence in the civil service, is an independent agency headed by a presidential appointee. It is not part of the Justice Department.</p>

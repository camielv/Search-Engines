        <p>On the eve of his official announcement tour to declare his candidacy for president, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, has replaced his finance director, a move that came after the campaign reported it had raised less than the party's two other leading candidates.</p>
        <p>The fund-raiser who was let go, Carla Eudy, a longtime adviser, will be replaced by Mary Kate Johnson, a former Bush fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>The shakeup at the top of his financial apparatus follows the disclosure that Mr. McCain raised $13.7 million, less than Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who raised $21 million, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who raised $16 million.</p>
        <p>The move underscores just how critical fund-raising is at this point for Mr. McCain. He coasted for several months as the presumed front-runner in the Republican field. But with his continued support for an unpopular war, his age (70) and some recent missteps, Mr. McCain has found himself lagging behind Mr. Giuliani in the polls.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain started to step up his fund-raising pace a month ago and has built fund-raising events into his announcement tour, which will start in New Hampshire on Wednesday and take him through South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada before ending up in Arizona.</p>
        <p>In addition, his campaign has organized a separate fund-raising drive geared toward young professionals, with events this week in Connecticut and New York. With younger voters in mind, he went on the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' on CBS on Feb. 28 and revealed that he would soon be announcing his candidacy.</p>
        <p>And on Tuesday, he made an appearance on ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' on Comedy Central, where his efforts to make light of his much-criticized comments during a recent trip to Baghdad did not go over with the decidedly antiwar audience. At the end, Mr. Stewart asked Mr. McCain how America could ''quell a civil war when it's not your country,'' prompting the audience to roar in support -- of Mr. Stewart. That prompted Mr. McCain to say of the audience, ''I think I know who's side they're on.'' Mr. Stewart shot back, ''They're on America's side,'' and the audience again hollered in approval of Mr. Stewart.</p>
        <p>Brian Jones, a spokesman for Mr. McCain, said the change in finance directors was a ''continuation of the restructuring of the campaign that began after the results of the first-quarter fund-raising had come in.''</p>
        <p>Not only did Mr. McCain raise less than his rivals, but he also spent more. He had about $5.2 million on hand, while Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani each had about $12 million.</p>
        <p>Ms. Eudy is a longtime member of Mr. McCain's inner circle and is to remain a senior adviser.</p>

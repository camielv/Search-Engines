        <p>Re ''Boris N. Yeltsin, Reformer Who Broke Up the U.S.S.R. and Led Russia, Dies at 76'' (front page, April 24):</p>
        <p>Boris N. Yeltsin was ''A Tale of Two Men.''</p>
        <p>On the one hand, he was very brave and heroic, helping bring down Communism and install democracy and a free-market economy in Russia. He was a proud Russian nationalist who allowed the Soviet Union's former republics to become independent states. In addition, he sought closer ties with the West.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, he exhibited many flaws and shortcomings. He allowed corruption to become rampant. After he took power, unemployment and the shortage of goods were widespread. He got Russia into the disastrous Chechen war. Under his reign, the status and power of Russia dramatically declined.</p>
        <p>When convenient, he used dictatorial and heavy-handed tactics. At times, one was almost tempted to ask, Will the real Boris Yeltsin please stand up? He was definitely a man of many contradictions and paradoxes.</p>
        <p>Kenneth L. Zimmerman  Huntington Beach, Calif.  April 24, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Boris N. Yeltsin was often described as one would describe Russia itself: at his best, passionate, strong, courageous and proud; at his worst, quick-tempered, stubborn and suspicious.</p>
        <p>We have a choice in remembering him. We can remember the Russian strongman who ordered an attack on his own Parliament, or we can remember the hero who bravely stood atop a tank in defiance of one of the most oppressive regimes in history, leading the Russian people toward the promise of a democratic future.</p>
        <p>In remembering Mr. Yeltsin's legacy in Russia, we must not forget our own struggles as a new democracy, including the near-extermination of the Native Americans and the Civil War. We also must ask ourselves, When bravery and political courage are called for today in our country, which of our leaders would stand on a tank and oppose conventional wisdom?</p>

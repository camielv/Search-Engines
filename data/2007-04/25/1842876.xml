        <p>New nuclear reactors need not be designed to withstand suicide attacks by big airplanes, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission decided Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Instead, the commission proposed that designers be required to analyze how their reactors can be built to mitigate the effects of such an attack, ''to the extent practicable.''</p>
        <p>The commission's staff characterized the vote, which was 4 to 1, as an additional step to improve plant security in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The chairman, Dale Klein, said in a statement, ''This proposal gives us the chance to assess and make practicable changes to new reactor designs early in the design process.''</p>
        <p>In fact, however, the commission has already approved two designs, one by General Electric and one by Westinghouse, for which no such analysis was required.</p>
        <p>No new reactors have been ordered in the United States since the 1970s, although the commission expects several orders soon, brought on in part by the rising price of competing fuels. One design now pending before the commission, a French-German model called the EPR, was devised to meet a European requirement that reactors be built to withstand airplane crashes. And General Electric said in a statement Tuesday that it had assessed the capabilities of its two new reactor designs, including the one already approved, and that both ''have the capability to withstand the effects of an aircraft crash.''</p>
        <p>Most of several new designs incorporate features that could be helpful in case of a plane crash, like locating emergency water supplies inside the containment building, at an elevation above the reactor vessel, instead of in a tank outside the building.</p>
        <p>But the dissenting commissioner in Tuesday's vote, Gregory B. Jaczko, said the tighter standard would have been ''a reasonable and prudent measure for the agency to take.''</p>
        <p>Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is a frequent critic of the way nuclear power is regulated, said the commission had abdicated its responsibility by turning its back on ''a common-sense regulatory measure.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, one commissioner in the majority, Edward McGaffigan Jr., said the agency's rules were routinely based on weighing cost against benefit. That, Mr. McGaffigan said, requires knowing the probability of an earthquake, a tornado or another threat to a plant.</p>
        <p>''It's very hard to do cost-benefit analysis, which you can do with severe accidents, when you have no basis other than speculation for probabilities of an airplane attack,'' he said. By the time new plants are actually built, he added, the aircraft industry may have solved the problem by installing equipment to control planes remotely in case of hijacking.</p>
        <p>For 20 years, Mr. McGaffigan said, the commission has taken a consistent approach: some accidents are considered inside the ''design basis,'' and plants have to be built to survive them; others are ''beyond design basis,'' and while designers must analyze how to mitigate the effect, the plants need not be built to withstand them. Aircraft attacks are in the latter category, he said.</p>

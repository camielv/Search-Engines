        <p>Cirque du Soleil's 'Wintuk' Is Garden's Holiday Show  ''Wintuk'' is the title of the Cirque du Soleil holiday show that will occupy the Theater at Madison Square Garden from Nov. 1 through Jan. 6, in its world premiere engagement. Created for a family audience, the plot deals with a boy named Wintuk and his quest for snow and adventure, which takes him and three companions from a city where he encounters acrobats, dancers and talking marionettes to an imaginary Arctic where they meet gigantic ice characters before returning home on the wings of a giant crane. ''We look forward to entertaining audiences with 'Wintuk' through the holidays for the next several years,'' said Jay Marciano, president of MSG Entertainment. Tickets go on sale on Sunday.</p>
        <p>China to Knock Down 17th-Century Opera House  The 17th-century Guanghe Theater, billed as the oldest opera house in Beijing, is to be demolished in favor of a state-of-the-art theater, CBC Arts reported. ''We intend to build a modern, professional venue like those on Broadway in the United States, where regular shows are offered all year round and high-end performances can also take place,'' Ma Dekai, director of cultural facility construction in the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture, told the Xinhua news agency. No details of the design or the opening date of the new theater were given. The Guanghe, constructed in the final years of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), is one of a handful of opera houses remaining from about 40 that the city once had. In 2000, government officials declared the Guanghe unsafe.</p>
        <p>Mystery Writer Turns Opera Librettist  Ian Rankin, the novelist acclaimed for mysteries featuring Detective Inspector John Rebus, the lone-wolf Scottish police official, is turning his hand to opera. He is one of five authors commissioned by the Scottish Opera to write a libretto as part of its campaign to garner more interest in the arts, The Times of London reported. Mr. Rankin, left, who has been at work on his final Inspector Rebus novel, said he was being allowed to devote the libretto to anything he wanted, although he would not discuss his choice. He will be collaborating with the film composer Craig Armstrong, whose credits include ''World Trade Center,'' ''Must Love Dogs,'' ''Fever Pitch,'' ''Ray'' and ''Moulin Rouge.'' The five short operas are to be performed in February in Glasgow and Edinburgh.</p>
        <p>Go South, Young Man?  Is Harry Potter bound for the leisure life in Florida? Universal Studios is working on a deal with Harry's creator, J. K. Rowling, to build a $500 million Harry Potter theme park in Florida, the newspaper Scotland on Sunday reported. The new attraction is likely to become part of Universal's Islands of Adventure in Orlando, which includes Marvel Super Hero Island and Jurassic Park. Peter Alexander, a former vice president of University Studios who founded a theme park design consultancy, said Ms. Rowling stands to make about $18 million a year if the park deal comes to fruition. If details are ironed out, the Potter playground could be open in 18 months. Universal and Ms. Rowling declined to comment. Potter fans online were already proposing rides with names including Fred and George Weasley's Laser Fun House, Azkaban Prison, the Gringotts Bank Ghost Train and Crazy Quidditch. ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' starring Daniel Radcliffe, above, opens in theaters July 13.</p>
        <p>Pirates Capture Spider-Man  China's pirates have struck again. Nearly two weeks before its American premiere, ''Spider-Man 3,'' starring Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, is on sale on the streets of Beijing, Reuters reported. Priced at $1 each, the pirated DVDs look like the real thing, complete with a picture of the hero in his new black spider costume and even bearing a warning in Chinese against pirating the product. A copy bought yesterday and put in a player, however, did not work. The problem is common. Many Chinese DVDs are made with poor equipment in dingy backrooms.</p>
        <p>Jail Term for Founder Of 'Girls Gone Wild'  Blowing his nose and wiping away his tears, Joe Francis, below, 34, the multimillionaire founder of the ''Girls Gone Wild'' empire of breast-baring videos, pleaded guilty to contempt of court on Monday in Panama City, Fla., and was sentenced to 35 days in jail, The Associated Press reported. He apologized to United States District Judge Richard Smoak for yelling during negotiations to settle a lawsuit brought by seven women who were minors when they were filmed at Panama City Beach in 2003. He said the women lied about their ages. He has reached a settlement for an undisclosed amount.</p>

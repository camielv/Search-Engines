        <p>President Bush fought with the Democrats over war financing yesterday morning. But in the afternoon he came to Harlem to seek common cause with the rival party, on its home turf, on his signature education initiative, No Child Left Behind.</p>
        <p>The trip gave the president a chance to joke with Representative Charles B. Rangel, usually a Democratic nemesis, who rode with him in the presidential limousine to Harlem and to praise Joel Klein, chancellor of the New York schools and a former Clinton administration official.</p>
        <p>''You know, the people in Harlem have got a fantastic congressman in Charles Rangel,'' Mr. Bush said, speaking in the auditorium of the Harlem Village Academy Charter School. ''He can agree with me a few more times, but -- I don't expect him to -- but I do expect him to do what he does, which is work for the good of the country.''</p>
        <p>After complimenting Mr. Klein on the school system, Mr. Bush, who was soundly defeated in the city in the 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns, said, ''As a result of that endorsement, he may never find work again in New York.''</p>
        <p>The contrast in mood from the morning was part of the new normal for Mr. Bush as he adjusts to life with an adversarial Congress controlled by Democrats and populated with restive Republicans.</p>
        <p>Even as he battles Democrats over war financing, he must rely on them for help winning approval of major domestic initiatives like his proposed immigration law overhaul and the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind law, which, among other things, ties federal school financing to performance-based results over time, measured by annual, standardized tests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush views the legislation, passed with help from Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, as a legacy project. But, like so many other parts of his agenda, it is coming under fire in Congress.</p>
        <p>A group of Republicans is pushing legislation that would free states from the law's mandates, and they have some Democratic support. Other Democrats, including Mr. Kennedy, are seeking various changes, including higher financing levels.</p>
        <p>The White House still views Mr. Kennedy as a crucial ally, and, Mr. Bush said at the Harlem school, ''When we put our mind to it, actually Republicans and Democrats can work together -- we did so to get this important piece of legislation passed.''</p>
        <p>But, he warned, ''When Republicans and Democrats take a look at this bill, I strongly urge them to not weaken the bill, not to backslide, not to say, accountability isn't that important.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was speaking at a charter school -- privately run with public money -- in which the Bloomberg administration takes pride because of the sharp improvements in its students' test scores.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush hailed those scores, saying, ''We can see that No Child Left Behind is working nationwide.''</p>

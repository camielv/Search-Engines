        <p>The Newark Municipal Council yesterday unanimously approved a $720 million budget for 2007, making it one of the first in two decades to be passed on time and without a tax increase. Although the city is facing a $180 million shortfall next year, Mayor Cory A. Booker said he did not want to increase property taxes, which rose 8.3 percent last year, or about $322 for the average homeowner. The city actually cut the municipal tax levy this year by 7.8 percent to offset an increase in county and school taxes. To plug the looming deficit in 2008, Mr. Booker has been warning residents that he may have to cut services, reduce the municipal payroll and raise property taxes.</p>

        <p>Kryptonite, the one mineral that is deadly to Superman, the Man of Steel, was discovered, really, by a group of researchers in Serbia, according to a report by the BBC. In comic books, kryptonite comes in an assortment of colors and with different side effects. Overexposure to the green variety would kill Superman, whereas the gold kind would permanently strip him of his powers. The real-world researchers turned to Chris Stanley, a mineralogist at the Natural History Museum in London, for help in identifying a substance they found. Dr. Stanley's Web search found that the new mineral's chemistry matched the description of kryptonite's composition in last year's film ''Superman Returns.'' ''The universe is full of mysteries, and some have been foreshadowed by comics,'' said Paul Levitz, president and publisher of DC Comics, longtime home of Superman. ''We look forward to scientists figuring this one out.'' Coincidently, the first storyline of a new series, ''Superman Confidential,'' deals with Superman's first encounter with the deadly substance. It is written by Darwyn Cooke and illustrated by Tim Sale, whose work is featured on NBC's ''Heroes.'' The next part of the story will be published June 20.</p>

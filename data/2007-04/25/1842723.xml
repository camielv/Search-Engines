        <p>Opening This Week</p>
        <p>FR.OG This two-level SoHo restaurant is round three for Didier Virot, a talented Jean Georges alumnus. He failed with his first venture, Virot in the Dylan Hotel (and was followed there, ignominiously, by Britney Spears). His second outing was Aix Brasserie on the Upper West Side, where he still oversees the menu. Now with his Aix partner Philip Kirsh he's come up with the French-Mediterranean Fr.og (the name is short for France Origine), which carries strong whiffs of French colonial outposts, especially Morocco, in dishes like tagine of monkfish and chicken roasted with lemon and honey, and also in the glittery mosaic tiles and the lacy decorative elements: 71 Spring Street (Crosby Street), (212) 966-5050.</p>
        <p>GRAND HARMONY PALACE On Thursday evenings, this vast Chinese restaurant will convert into a retro nightclub with big-band jazz and dancing. Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks will do two sets starting at 8 and 10 p.m. after a Chinese floor show. The official opening is May 17, but there is a trial run tomorrow night. Admission will be $15, plus a $15 minimum that can be spent on dim sum, Cantonese dishes and drinks: 98 Mott Street (Canal Street), (212) 226-6603. Suba Yann de Rochefort said he launched this Spanish spot ''on a shoestring'' five years ago and got the chance to fine-tune it only now. He reopens it today with softer, diffused light lending it a more modern look, and with Seamus Mullen, his chef at Boqueria, in the kitchen. Mr. Mullen will indulge his creative impulses (and his penchant for smoky flavors) with less classic fare like pork belly with smoked potatoes and greens, crispy frog legs with smoked paprika, and foie gras with smoked eel: 109 Ludlow Street (Delancey Street) (212) 982-5714.</p>
        <p>Looking Ahead</p>
        <p>ADOUR Alain Ducasse's new restaurant, to open in late summer in the former Lespinasse in the St. Regis hotel, will be named after a river in southwest France near the chef's birthplace. Conveniently, his initials are also reflected in the name. Hill Country  It took six months, but Marc Glosserman has finally assembled a team of chefs for his sprawling barbecue emporium, to open in early June. Elizabeth Karmel, above, a former spokeswoman for Weber and an author of grilling books, will be the executive chef. Robbie Richter, a native of Queens who has won barbecue contests and is an owner of the catering operation Big Island Bar-B-Que, will be the pitmaster: 30 West 26th Street, (212) 255-4544.  Sullivan Street Pizza Jim Lahey, who shed his original bakery in SoHo last year, keeping the West 47th Street location, plans to open a rustic bread and pizza cafe in the fall, with sandwiches, charcuterie, cheeses, beer and wine: 230 Ninth Avenue (24th Street), no phone.</p>
        <p>Open Now</p>
        <p>BIRDBATH The opening of this new little eco-conscious branch of Maury Rubin's City Bakery was less of a stealth affair than that of the first one in the East Village. The inventory of cookies, muffins, pastries and drinks has been expanded, as have the hours: 145 Seventh Avenue South (Charles Street), (646) 722-6470.</p>

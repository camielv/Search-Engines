        <p>Sheila Lukins and Julee Rosso, the founders of Silver Palate, collaborated on a groundbreaking, bestselling cookbook in 1982. A few years later they had a falling out, the reasons for which have faded. In the intervening years, Ms. Lukins, right below, wrote other cookbooks and Ms. Rosso, left below, moved to Michigan and opened an inn. Now, they are celebrating the 25th anniversary of ''The Silver Palate Cookbook,'' and the 30th anniversary of the opening of their little store on Columbus Avenue.</p>

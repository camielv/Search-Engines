        <p>A private equity firm and an Italian billionaire won the takeover battle Tuesday for Britain's largest drugstore chain, Alliance Boots, in Europe's biggest private equity buyout.</p>
        <p>The equity firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company, and Stefano Pessina, who is Alliance Boots' deputy chairman and largest shareholder, agreed to pay £11.39, or $22.80, a share in cash for Alliance Boots, valuing the company at £11.1 billion, or $22 billion.</p>

        <p>A private equity firm and an Italian billionaire won the takeover battle Tuesday for Britain's largest drugstore chain, Alliance Boots, in Europe's biggest private equity buyout.</p>
        <p>The equity firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company, and Stefano Pessina, who is Alliance Boots' deputy chairman and largest shareholder, agreed to pay £11.39, or $22.80, a share in cash for Alliance Boots, valuing the company at £11.1 billion, or $22 billion.</p>
        <p>The offer is more than 40 percent above the company's share price before takeover talks started earlier this year.</p>
        <p>A rival bid from a group that included Terra Firma Capital Partners and the Wellcome Trust, a medical charity, was withdrawn on Tuesday, after Kohlberg Kravis and Mr. Pessina had bought enough Alliance Boots shares to block any other bid.</p>
        <p>Kohlberg Kravis and Mr. Pessina, who were forced to increase their bid three times from an initial £10 a share, bought 90 million Alliance Boots shares on Monday and Tuesday at £11.39 each to bring their combined holdings to about 26 percent.</p>
        <p>Retailers are an attractive investment for private equity firms because they usually have a steady income and own real estate against which buyout firms can borrow money to finance a takeover.</p>
        <p>This month Kohlberg Kravis and other equity firms shelved plans to buy J Sainsbury, one of Britain's largest supermarket chains, because the founding family had rejected an approach.</p>
        <p>After Alliance UniChem merged with the Boots Group last year, the combined company had started a cost-cutting program, which Kohlberg Kravis and Mr. Pessina plan to speed up.</p>
        <p>Alliance Boots, whose roots go back to an herbal remedies shop started by the Boot family in 1849, sells beauty products, drugs and snacks through a chain of 3,100 stores and, through a wholesale drug supplier, more than 125,000 pharmacies and hospitals.</p>
        <p>The group led by Terra Firma, which also included HBOS, the British mortgage lender, said Tuesday that they were disappointed about losing the bid but pleased that Alliance Boots shareholders were getting a higher price.</p>

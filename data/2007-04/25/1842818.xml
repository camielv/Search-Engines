        <p>Crispin Porter, which works for brands like Burger King, Coke Zero and Volkswagen, will create campaigns for Nike shoes as well as for the Nike ID Web site and the Nike Plus shoe. Wieden &amp; Kennedy, which produced campaigns for Nike like ''Just do it,'' will continue as the main agency.</p>

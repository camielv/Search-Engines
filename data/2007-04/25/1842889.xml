      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Supreme Judicial Council, the five judges conducting an inquiry into misconduct allegations against Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, the chief justice suspended by President Pervez Musharraf last month, again put off a hearing on the case, this time until Monday. Earlier, the Supreme Court adjourned a hearing on Mr. Chaudhry's complaint of bias on the part of some of the council judges. Mr. Chaudhry wants his old court to hear the case against him, but the justice handling the petition said he could not decide on it because he had supported Mr. Chaudhry's suspension. He called for a broader panel.</p>

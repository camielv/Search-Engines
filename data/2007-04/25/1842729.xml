        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- When the six finalists return to hear their fates after last night's vote, they will be surrounded by some established winners -- of Oscars, Golden Globes, Emmys and Grammys, no less -- in a two-hour ''Idol'' that concludes a two-night charity drive. The original Idol, Kelly Clarkson, above, joins the singers Gwen Stefani, Josh Groban, Pink and Annie Lennox and the actors Keira Knightley, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Radcliffe and Hugh Grant. (Mr. Grant recently starred in the ''Idol''-based film ''American Dreamz.'') The show will solicit donations for charities that help children living in poverty in Africa and the United States. Just in case that sounds too serious, Borat will be there too.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CBS) JERICHO -- Resources are scarce in the post-apocalyptic world, and the citizens of Jericho must defend their salt mine from a neighboring city. Several people are shot.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) ACCORDING TO JIM  -- The grill may be the most manly of cooking accouterments, but the men turn into little boys when Andy wants to sell the grill Jim gave him.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (13, 49) BATTLE FOR THE BIBLE -- Christians throughout the English-speaking world may take the King James version of the Bible for granted, but as this ''Secrets of the Dead'' episode recounts, the men who first dared to translate the Scriptures into English faced persecution and death.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CW) AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL -- For those who can't get enough of the girl fights, Tyra Banks's contestants will not disappoint tonight. The show rolls out never-before-seen film that includes a fracas between Dionne and Renee. The prospective models also stage a mock fashion show.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (CBS) CROSSING JORDAN -- The workaholic Jordan decides she has sufficiently recovered from brain surgery to return to work; Macy allows it only because Jordan promises to take it easy. Right. The promise takes a back seat when she finds herself drawn into a murder investigation.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13, 49) BUYING THE WAR -- The season premiere of ''Bill Moyers Journal'' examines the proposition that the news media were complicit in pushing the United States into the war in Iraq. Dan Rather, Tim Russert and Bob Simon appear in interviews.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (IFC) MONSTER  (2003). Charlize Theron packed on 30 pounds and wore gnarly false teeth to become Aileen Wuornos, the Florida prostitute turned serial killer who was put to death via lethal injection in 2002 for murdering six men. Ms. Theron's transformation apparently worked: she earned a best-actress Oscar. Christina Ricci (above left, with Ms. Theron) plays Selby, Wuornos's lover, who ultimately testified against her.</p>
        <p>10:30 P.M. (Comedy Central) HALFWAY HOME -- When the residents of the halfway house are asked to ''scare straight'' a juvenile delinquent, will they be able to stay on point or will they fixate on the youth's obesity?</p>

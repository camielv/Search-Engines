        <p>It is not surprising that the Bush administration, which believes that government was meant to serve the party and not the people, is increasingly haunted by the Hatch Act. This is the nearly forgotten 1939 law that forbids federal workers from politicking during tax-paid office hours.</p>
        <p>A House committee is investigating an outrageous videoconference last January at which a deputy to Karl Rove delivered a PowerPoint lecture to managers at the General Services Administration -- the government's housekeeping agency, which has enormous contracting power -- on which Republican members of Congress could use bolstering in the next election. The administrator, Lurita Doan, was quoted by several at the gathering as asking how agency workers could ''help 'our candidates' in the next election.'' Ms. Doan told Congress she did not remember that.</p>

        <p>It is not surprising that the Bush administration, which believes that government was meant to serve the party and not the people, is increasingly haunted by the Hatch Act. This is the nearly forgotten 1939 law that forbids federal workers from politicking during tax-paid office hours.</p>
        <p>A House committee is investigating an outrageous videoconference last January at which a deputy to Karl Rove delivered a PowerPoint lecture to managers at the General Services Administration -- the government's housekeeping agency, which has enormous contracting power -- on which Republican members of Congress could use bolstering in the next election. The administrator, Lurita Doan, was quoted by several at the gathering as asking how agency workers could ''help 'our candidates' in the next election.'' Ms. Doan told Congress she did not remember that.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Times reports similar political pitches at other agencies with other White House officials, including Mr. Rove. Representative Henry Waxman of California has stirred enough evidence of chicanery to finally prod promises for an inquiry by the administration's Hatch Act watchdog, the Office of Special Counsel. But beware of the watchdog.</p>
        <p>The chief of that office, Scott Bloch, is a Bush appointee who has been accused of playing politics on the job. Mr. Bloch's duties include shielding whistle-blowers, but some of Mr. Bloch's employees have said he has tried to silence whistle-blowers and intimidate anyone who complained to federal investigators. Mr. Bloch denies the accusations.</p>
        <p>It is past time to get to the bottom of the administration's sleazy on-the-job politicking. Congress is already investigating Republican Party e-mail ties with Mr. Rove and others involved in the firings of eight United States attorneys. How many government agencies might have been despoiled by the White House's substitution of political machinations for honorable service? Taxpayers deserve answers.</p>

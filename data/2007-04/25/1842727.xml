        <p>''Rosevelt's America,'' the story of an African refugee's progress in the United States, shows up tonight on PBS in the wake of other, more high-profile examples of that genre, including the feature documentary ''God Grew Tired of Us'' and Dave Eggers's fictionalized memoir, ''What Is the What?'' It actually predates them, though, having been shown in theaters in 2005, and it has one significant point in its favor: it's only a half-hour long.</p>
        <p>The directors, Roger Weisberg and Tod Lending, who have three Oscar nominations for documentaries between them, manage to cram all the essential elements of this type of narrative into that short running time in elegant fashion. Rosevelt Henderson, a target of violence (he is a civil engineer) in a war-torn country (in this case, Liberia), escapes with his two sons to the United States, where he takes jobs he's vastly overqualified for (airport van driver, janitor) while attending computer classes and working to bring over the family members he left behind (wife and baby daughter).</p>

        <p>''Rosevelt's America,'' the story of an African refugee's progress in the United States, shows up tonight on PBS in the wake of other, more high-profile examples of that genre, including the feature documentary ''God Grew Tired of Us'' and Dave Eggers's fictionalized memoir, ''What Is the What?'' It actually predates them, though, having been shown in theaters in 2005, and it has one significant point in its favor: it's only a half-hour long.</p>
        <p>The directors, Roger Weisberg and Tod Lending, who have three Oscar nominations for documentaries between them, manage to cram all the essential elements of this type of narrative into that short running time in elegant fashion. Rosevelt Henderson, a target of violence (he is a civil engineer) in a war-torn country (in this case, Liberia), escapes with his two sons to the United States, where he takes jobs he's vastly overqualified for (airport van driver, janitor) while attending computer classes and working to bring over the family members he left behind (wife and baby daughter).</p>
        <p>''Rosevelt's America'' is in the inspirational subcategory, so there's never any doubt that we'll be rewarded with this type of documentary's money shot: the tearful airport reunion. And when it comes, you'll cry too.</p>
        <p>The filmmakers don't explain how Mr. Henderson's story was chosen from among the tens of thousands of possibilities, which leaves us to assume that inspiration -- the slow but steady climb toward the American dream -- is the point. Any doubts about that are banished by the ad for the DVD, which has a slightly expanded title: ''Rosevelt's America: A Refugee's Inspiring Journey.''</p>
        <p>Some viewers will feel that while survival is obviously its own reward, there's still something not entirely cheering in the specter of a former civil engineer and an accountant working as a janitor and as a nurse's aide.</p>
        <p>But in this genre everything's about the next generation. And even though it has been done before, the closing scene of the Hendersons' children in their Sunday best as the reunited family joins a local church is pure uplift. It's easy to forget your quibbles when Rosevelt, speaking of his wife's long-awaited arrival in America, says, ''We got a team now.''</p>
        <p>Rosevelt's America  On most PBS stations tonight (check local listings).</p>
        <p>Produced and directed by Roger Weisberg and Tod Lending; Produced by Public Policy Productions in association with Thirteen/WNET New York.</p>

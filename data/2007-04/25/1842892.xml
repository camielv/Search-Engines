        <p>Justice Marilyn Shafer of State Supreme Court yesterday struck down the Tenant Empowerment Act, a 2005 New York City law giving tenants in subsidized rental buildings the right of first refusal to buy their buildings if the owners decide to sell or quit rental assistance programs like Mitchell-Lama. Justice Shafer said she ''reluctantly'' concluded that the city cannot limit rights granted to building owners by the State Legislature in allowing them to withdraw from Mitchell-Lama. The Legislature itself could choose to protect middle- and low-income tenants in those buildings, she pointed out. ''In failing to do so, or to permit the City of New York to do so, the State Legislature has failed the residents of the City of New York,'' she wrote in her opinion.</p>

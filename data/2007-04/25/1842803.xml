        <p>CBS Sports is refusing to show a commercial for Maxfli, the golf ball maker, in which John Daly, whose fondness for alcohol is well known, drives a golf cart on a municipal course while carrying what appears to be beer.</p>
        <p>The 30-second ad is produced as a music video set in a rowdy bar with Daly singing ''Go Long or Go Home'' while he plays guitar (and dances). It is intercut with shots of Daly driving off a tee, tooling around in a cart, riding on the back of the cart and grabbing a cup of what looks like beer -- Maxfli says it is ginger ale -- but not drinking it as he drives away.</p>

        <p>CBS Sports is refusing to show a commercial for Maxfli, the golf ball maker, in which John Daly, whose fondness for alcohol is well known, drives a golf cart on a municipal course while carrying what appears to be beer.</p>
        <p>The 30-second ad is produced as a music video set in a rowdy bar with Daly singing ''Go Long or Go Home'' while he plays guitar (and dances). It is intercut with shots of Daly driving off a tee, tooling around in a cart, riding on the back of the cart and grabbing a cup of what looks like beer -- Maxfli says it is ginger ale -- but not drinking it as he drives away.</p>
        <p>Maxfli submitted the ad to CBS last Monday. After several days of talks, the network rejected it as inappropriate.</p>
        <p>''Any implication that participants are drinking in excess or performing an activity that requires a level of alertness while drinking does not meet network standards,'' said LeslieAnne Wade, a CBS Sports spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Bob Maggiore, the senior director of global marketing at Maxfli, said: ''This isn't an alcohol spot. This is a spot that is supposed to be fun and exciting and show the brand to be fun and accessible.'' He said it was common practice for people to carry a beer while traveling a course on a golf cart.</p>
        <p>''If there were rules for alcohol on a golf course,'' Maggiore said in a telephone interview, ''there'd be a sobriety check on the 10th green.''</p>
        <p>He added that CBS felt there was ''excessive drinking in the bar scenes with John singing.''</p>
        <p>''But we don't think so,'' Maggiore said. ''We think it's a heck of a lot of fun.''</p>
        <p>Daly has been treated for alcohol abuse, but still drinks beer.</p>
        <p>It is unusual for advertisers to publicize the rejection of its commercials by a network. But GoDaddy.com, the Internet domain registry known for creating sexually provocative ads, has done so with relish. And like GoDaddy before it, Maxfli is posting the ad that CBS rejected on its Web site.</p>
        <p>GoDaddy announced yesterday that it had acquired the presenting sponsorship of next month's Indianapolis 500. Danica Patrick, one of the drivers, appeared in a GoDaddy Super Bowl ad that CBS deemed acceptable and will be the focus of its advertising during the race.</p>
        <p>Ed Erhardt, the president of ESPN/ABC consumer marketing and sales, which sold the sponsorship, said that GoDaddy was aware that this was a chance ''to be in front of a large audience on Memorial Day.''</p>
        <p>While GoDaddy seems to be taming the raciest extreme of its reputation to be part of the Indy 500, Maxfli will lose millions of viewers because of the dispute with CBS.</p>
        <p>CBS was Maxfli's target for the Daly ad because it will carry 8 of the next 10 events on the PGA Tour schedule.</p>
        <p>''We're extremely disappointed,'' Maggiore said, ''mostly from the standpoint that I've seen the reactions of rooms full of people when they see it, and nobody's objected to it.'' The ad is part of a campaign to reposition Maxfli balls as tools that produce ''affordable Tour performance'' and to introduce the new line of $20-a-dozen Fire balls and $30 Tour Fire balls.</p>
        <p>The Daly ad has already run about 10 times on the Golf Channel, which last year ran his reality series, ''The Daly Planet.'' Dan Higgins, a spokesman, said that while the ad met network standards, ''we're sensitive to the issues at hand and are looking at other viable options to running the commercial,'' like restricting its airing to later hours or running an edited version.</p>

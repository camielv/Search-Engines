        <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is resurrecting plans to build a skyscraper over the north wing of the bus terminal on Eighth Avenue between 42nd and 41st Streets.</p>
        <p>The authority plans to enter into exclusive negotiations for the next six months with the developers -- Lawrence Ruben Company and Vornado Realty Trust -- to build a 1.39-million-square-foot, glass-and-steel tower. If a deal cannot be struck, the Port Authority will allow other developers to bid. The authority's board is expected to approve the plan today.</p>
        <p>The new agreement revives an eight-year-old project and brings an end to litigation between the authority and the two developers. After a competition in 1999, the Port Authority selected Vornado and the Lawrence Ruben Company to build a $500 million office tower with large electronic signs.</p>
        <p>The developers agreed to pay more than $110 million for the development rights and to renovate the terminal's north wing. But the project fell by the wayside in 2001 after the dot-com collapse and a decline in the economy. Shortly after, Vornado sued the authority in an attempt to retain control of the project.</p>
        <p>Late last year, Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado, approached the authority's chairman, Anthony R. Coscia, about settling the litigation and restarting the project.</p>

        <p>The title of the documentary ''The Collector'' undersells its subject, the influential New York art gallery owner Allan Stone, who died in December after a long career spent introducing the world to his discoveries.</p>
        <p>As depicted by the filmmaker, Mr. Stone's daughter Olympia, the man's taste in art was breathtakingly eclectic, from African fetish pieces and cigar store Indians to works by Andy Warhol, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Wayne Thiebaud and John Chamberlain. His urge to acquire and display his belongings was so insistent that it crowded the rest of his life, literally.</p>
        <p>When not interviewing Mr. Stone, the artists he championed and the patrons and critics who appreciated his enthusiasm (including Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic for The New York Times), Ms. Stone takes her camera through Mr. Stone's Westchester County home, so packed with notable items that it might be a secret annex of the Smithsonian.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stone's compulsion was not without unfortunate consequences. His wife and six daughters could feel marginalized by the objects piled around them, and you wish this generally rosy movie had explored those feelings more pointedly. But the film is still fascinating for its nonstop parade of significant 20th-century art, and for Jason Graves's playfully jumbled, sometimes borderline-cacophonous jazz score, which could be the music Mr. Stone heard in his head as he wandered the globe in search of one more acquisition.</p>
        <p>The Collector  Opens today in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Directed and edited by Olympia Stone; music by Jason Graves. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 62 minutes. This film is not rated.</p>

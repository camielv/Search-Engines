        <p>A $110 million settlement between Warner Music and Bertelsmann resolves claims that Bertelsmann had contributed to widespread copyright infringement.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Warner Music Group, the recording company, said yesterday that it would receive $110 million as part of a settlement with Bertelsmann, the German media giant, that resolves claims that Bertelsmann had contributed to widespread copyright infringement by supporting Napster, the file-sharing service.</p>
        <p>Under the settlement with Warner Music, Bertelsmann will admit no liability.</p>
        <p>Bertelsmann provided Napster with about $85 million in loans starting in late 2000, a time when Napster had enabled millions of users to trade pirated songs online. (Napster has since been reinvented as a licensed subscription service).</p>
        <p>The settlement comes a month after Bertelsmann reached a similar agreement with the EMI Group, the British music giant. Last year, Bertelsmann also agreed to pay about $60 million to resolve claims by the Universal Music Group, the world's biggest music corporation. That settlement was part of Universal's arrangement to buy Bertelsmann's music publishing unit for $2 billion.</p>
        <p>The agreement is the latest in a bitter chapter for the music industry, which has long sought redress for the havoc unleashed by Napster in 1999. After swapping music files online turned into a mass phenomenon, sales of recorded music plunged. While the industry has won several legal victories, it has been unable to reverse the slide.</p>

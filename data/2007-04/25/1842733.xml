        <p>AS television food moments go, it was one of the odder ones: former President Bill Clinton and Rachael Ray tossing together a bowl of turkey Bolognese with whole wheat pasta in her television kitchen.</p>
        <p>The former leader of the free world was not supposed to be anywhere near a pot or a pan, but Mr. Clinton just couldn't help himself.</p>
        <p>''I love to cook,'' he said, ignoring Ms. Ray's polite efforts to keep him to the side of the stove. ''I used to cook a lot.''</p>
        <p>The studio audience, just starting to recover after realizing that Mr. Clinton was the day's surprise guest, was also the first to hear the pair's news. They were now partners in the fight against childhood obesity.</p>
        <p>The episode of her syndicated daytime show, ''Rachael Ray,'' was recorded April 12 and will be broadcast tomorrow. (Showtimes can be found online at rachaelray.com.) It is timed to coincide both with spring sweeps and with the birth of the Yum-o Organization, Ms. Ray's new nonprofit multimedia mix of culinary education, encouragement and scholarships.</p>
        <p>Through Yum-o, she plans to create segments for her show and a new Web site, www.yum-o.org, that might help a family figure out how to hit the grocery store on a Sunday afternoon and come home with the right ingredients to make three simple meals for the week.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ray will work with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, the organization President Clinton's foundation and the American Heart Association created to combat diabetes and childhood obesity.</p>
        <p>The alliance last year elicited promises from soft-drink and food manufacturers to sell healthier products in school vending machines. It also works with schools that are reforming their lunchrooms and physical education programs. Yum-o will reward schools doing innovative work with Ms. Ray's line of cookware or even an appearance by Ms. Ray herself. Ms. Ray and the Alliance are also promoting the Go Healthy Challenge, part of the Nickelodeon series ''Let's Just Play,'' which begins its second season on Sunday.</p>
        <p>On the set with the former president, Ms. Ray, who is not often star struck, clearly was nervous. Mr. Clinton, however, was not. He mixed tales of his lifelong weight struggle with a tutorial on the causes and challenges of childhood obesity. Even though Mr. Clinton eventually began running 20 miles a week to try to stay slim, he always thought eating fast food was fun.</p>
        <p>''I've got a scar down my chest to prove it,'' he said, a reference to the quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery he had in 2004.</p>
        <p>About 13 million children are overweight, he said, and starting with this generation one in three are expected to develop Type 2 diabetes. For the first time, American children might not outlive their parents.</p>
        <p>''It will be immoral if we let it happen,'' he said. Mr. Clinton's organization has an unparalleled reach with large funding organizations and can open doors at food manufacturers. Ms. Ray, whose daytime talk show reaches more than 4 million people, can carry a message of healthier eating and exercise to families.</p>
        <p>To that end, she realizes her role in the new partnership is not to be the policy analyst.</p>
        <p>''I'm the smoke and mirrors,'' she said in an interview last week. ''Me, I don't want to talk about obesity. I want to talk about how fun healthy food is, period.''</p>

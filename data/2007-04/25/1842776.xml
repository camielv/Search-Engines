        <p>Last Saturday's presidential election should have marked a major consolidation of democracy in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and biggest oil producer: the first free choice of one elected civilian leader to succeed another. Instead, it was an ugly travesty -- not just procedurally flawed, but completely lacking in basic democratic plausibility.</p>
        <p>That, sadly, is the verdict of an impressive array of neutral observers, including the United States State Department, the European Union and Nigeria's own Transition Monitoring Group. Election monitors report that ballot boxes were stuffed and stolen, ballot papers missing or late, and voters unable to mark their choices in private. That capped a campaign marked by violence and intimidation and government-inspired efforts to keep credible opposition figures off the ballot illegally.</p>

        <p>Last Saturday's presidential election should have marked a major consolidation of democracy in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and biggest oil producer: the first free choice of one elected civilian leader to succeed another. Instead, it was an ugly travesty -- not just procedurally flawed, but completely lacking in basic democratic plausibility.</p>
        <p>That, sadly, is the verdict of an impressive array of neutral observers, including the United States State Department, the European Union and Nigeria's own Transition Monitoring Group. Election monitors report that ballot boxes were stuffed and stolen, ballot papers missing or late, and voters unable to mark their choices in private. That capped a campaign marked by violence and intimidation and government-inspired efforts to keep credible opposition figures off the ballot illegally.</p>
        <p>Nigerians are understandably angry and frustrated. But the last thing the country needs now is yet another in its long line of military saviors. It will now be up to Nigeria's judiciary, beginning with the special election tribunals, to try to repair as much of the damage as possible. Nigeria's courts have recently demonstrated a willingness to stand up to government meddling. By tackling the postelection confusion swiftly and judiciously, they can help restore public confidence and hold the military at bay.</p>
        <p>Most of the blame for this disgrace goes to Nigeria's outgoing president, Olusegun Obasanjo, who tried to amend the Constitution to be able to run for a third term and has since been willing to manipulate Nigeria's fragile democracy to keep his party in power. What makes it all the more poignant is that Nigerians -- and much of the world -- once admired Mr. Obasanjo precisely because he knew how to exit from power wisely and gracefully, becoming the first of Nigeria's military rulers to organize an admirably democratic civilian succession.</p>
        <p>The quality of Nigerian democracy is not a theoretical issue. Nigeria's sharp ethnic and religious divides have been at the root of decades of corruption, violence and dictatorship. Only a scrupulously fair and transparent federal democracy offers any hope of steering Nigeria on a healthy course.</p>

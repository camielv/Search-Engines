        <p>The death of a 5-year-old girl who was found hanged on Sunday in her Eastchester apartment has been ruled accidental by the city medical examiner, a spokeswoman said yesterday. The spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove, said the girl, Monet Fulgham, had accidentally hanged herself with a jump-rope. Ms. Borakove said the investigation showed that Monet ''was playing with a jump-rope that was attached to a closet door.''</p>

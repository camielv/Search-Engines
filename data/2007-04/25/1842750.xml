        <p>Anwar al-Bunni, a prominent human rights lawyer, was sentenced Tuesday by a Syrian court to five years in prison for ''spreading false information damaging the country,'' his lawyers said.</p>
        <p>The sentence was one of the harshest meted out in Syria's yearlong crackdown on government critics.</p>
        <p>Razan Zaitouneh, a lawyer for Mr. Bunni, said her client had been sentenced for ''spreading false information'' in writings and comments saying Syrian prisons practiced torture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bunni's lawyers and human rights campaigners said the verdict appeared to be a warning to the opposition in Syria.</p>
        <p>''It was a message to the entire opposition movement: pursue democracy, get punished,'' Ms. Zaitouneh said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bunni was one of several opposition figures arrested last May after signing a petition calling for Syria to recognize Lebanon's independence.</p>
        <p>The government has been cracking down on critics, who became more vocal after the killing of Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, in which the United Nations implicated Syria.</p>

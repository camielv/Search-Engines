        <p>Melamine, the chemical suspected in the deaths of pets around the country, was in food given to hogs and chickens in several states, and the Food and Drug Administration is trying to determine if the animals entered the human food supply, F.D.A. officials said Tuesday.</p>

        <p>Melamine, the chemical suspected in the deaths of pets around the country, was in food given to hogs and chickens in several states, and the Food and Drug Administration is trying to determine if the animals entered the human food supply, F.D.A. officials said Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Several thousand hogs have been quarantined and are being tested. The affected farms are in California, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and possibly Ohio. A poultry farm in Missouri is also under investigation.</p>
        <p>Hog urine has tested positive for melamine in several of those states after it was determined that the animals ate salvaged pet food that originated in factories that produced the tainted food. It is common in the United States to take pet food that does not meet quality standards and reconstitute it into livestock feed, Stephen Sundlof, the F.D.A.'s chief veterinarian, said in a conference call with reporters.</p>
        <p>The food and drug agency, which is already testing wheat gluten and rice protein for melamine, the chemical used to make plastic utensils and as a fertilizer in other countries, said Tuesday that as a precaution, it was expanding testing of imported ingredients and finished products that contain cornmeal, soy protein, rice bran and corn gluten. Those ingredients can be used to make many products, including breads, pastas, pizza dough, baby formulas, protein shakes and energy bars.</p>
        <p>The agency also expanded the time frame in which the products might have been in the food supply. Tainted wheat gluten began coming into this country in November. But other tainted products may have started coming in as early as July, when one of the importers changed to a new supplier in China, an F.D.A. official said.</p>
        <p>Binzhou Futian Biological Technology and the Anying Biological Development Company are under investigation by Chinese officials. China has barred the two companies from exporting products and has invited the F.D.A. to meet with the Chinese government, said Julia Ho, the associate director for Asia and the Pacific in the agency's Office for International Programs.</p>

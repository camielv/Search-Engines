        <p>Charlie Rose is a talk show host known for long and rambling questions. President Bush is famous for his short, Texas-terse answers.</p>
        <p>On last night's show, the two men reversed roles. Mr. Bush spoke forcefully and at length about Iraq. Mr. Rose was succinct.</p>
        <p>It was the closest Mr. Bush has come to the kind of winding declamations that Richard M. Nixon delivered to the British interviewer David Frost in 1977 and that are now resurrected on Broadway in ''Frost/Nixon,'' a play by Peter Morgan. Mr. Morgan, who was one of Mr. Rose's guests on Monday, told the host that American audiences would see parallels ''between presidents facing the wrath of a country that feels that in their name, bad decisions were made.''</p>
        <p>Actually, Mr. Bush looked more at ease than he usually does in interviews, but he did not offer any revelations about his showdown with Congress over financing for additional troops or his support for his embattled attorney general, Alberto R. Gonzales. He mostly expanded on positions he had staked out in the past. It was his wordiness that spoke volumes.</p>
        <p>The administration is under attack by Democrats and some Republicans, and Mr. Bush is increasingly described by his critics as isolated and out of touch. To counter that image, Mr. Bush turned to one of his least favorite pastimes: explaining himself to a reporter in front of a camera. Mr. Bush was fairly candid about why he decided to spend almost an hour defending his policies on public television, a venue that many conservatives mistrust as too liberal.</p>
        <p>''I do think it's important for me to explain to your listeners one more time, if I might, why I made the decision I made,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I believe that if Iraq were to fall apart, and there were to be a vacuum, into that vacuum would come extremist elements.'' He continued from there, explaining his concerns about a regional conflagration with less restraint and more dependent clauses than usual.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Bush's first in-depth interview since a round of television appearances he made after announcing in January that he would send more troops to Iraq. As the two men sat face to face in a room in the Waldorf-Astoria, Mr. Rose raised the issue of military buildup almost casually, saying, ''How is what's sometimes called 'the surge' going?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's answer was mixed. ''The good news is that sectarian death is down in Baghdad,'' he replied. ''The bad news is that spectacular car bombs still go off, in a way that tends to shake the confidence of the Iraqi people that their government can protect them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose asked his guest about Senator John McCain's admission that he had no ''Plan B'' if the administration's current strategy failed. Mr. Bush replied, somewhat grimly, ''The Plan B is to make Plan A work.'' But he went on to assure Mr. Rose that his administration constantly reassessed its plans and decision-making.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush chose Mr. Rose over other interviewers for the obvious reason: the courtly host does not traffic in hectoring, Mike Wallace-style interrogations, instead giving his guests room to free-associate and set their own agenda. And sometimes, that is more effective than cross-examination. Mr. Rose did not wring any secrets or expressions of regret from Mr. Bush, but he gave viewers a glimpse of what this president sounds like when he talks to a visitor behind closed doors, when the cameras are off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose is a Larry King for Mensa members; he is more genteel and cultivated than his brash CNN rival, but he, too, conducts a conversation, not an interview. His drawn-out questions come out pell-mell -- sometimes bland, sometimes probing and sometimes even highly personal, but in no particular order.</p>
        <p>Mostly, Mr. Rose is a facilitator, creating a comfortable ambience where important people and opinion-makers can speak at length and make more than one point. Dick Cavett in his heyday was wittier and more penetrating, but for viewers interested in thoughtful talk, Mr. Rose's stark studio is the best place in town.</p>
        <p>For presidents who want to reassure viewers that they think long and hard before they act, it is the only game in town.</p>

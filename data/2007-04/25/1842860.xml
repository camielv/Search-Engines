        <p>A sports article in some copies on Monday about Boston's 7-6 victory over the Yankees referred incorrectly to Derek Jeter's hitting, and referred imprecisely to a home run by Manny Ramírez as part of a third-inning string of four consecutive homers by Red Sox batters. Jeter's fifth-inning home run gave him at least one hit in 52 of his last 54 regular-season games in which he had an official at-bat -- not 53 of 55 games. And the home run by Ramírez went out of Fenway Park, not high into the Green Monster seats.</p>

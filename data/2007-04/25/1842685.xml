        <p>BUTKIN--Bernice The Sepkowitz family notes with profound sadness the recent death of our friend and touchstone, Bernice Butkin, a closet New Yorker for almost 80 years. She was sanity personified for us and countless other stragglers who sought her counsel across the many decades. To sit on the leather couch in her air conditioned Oklahoma City living room was to see adulthood as a worthy destination and one that might even be fun. She was equal parts Sigmund Freud and Dinah Shore and gently nosy neighbor. Gossip was never and will never again feel so vital and pleasantly mischievous. Her single-minded dedication to her family and to the idea of family will continue to guide us all. Ah, Bernice, thank you so much and please do rest in peace. Julie, Doug, Kent, Warren Sepkowitz and families</p>

        <p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the conservative candidate and front-runner for president, evoked his immigrant roots and quoted Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
        <p>Ségolène Royal, the Socialist, pledged to usher in 21st-century-style Socialism and never to kneel before President Bush.</p>
        <p>François Bayrou, the centrist, declared that he loved France more than he loved power.</p>
        <p>And Jean-Marie Le Pen, the head of the ultra-right National Front, branded all three of his main opponents worthless hypocrites.</p>
        <p>Fanning out to the far corners of France, all but one of the dozen French presidential candidates held their final major campaign rallies on Thursday night, offering starkly different personal styles and visions for governing.</p>
        <p>Every uttering, every nuance could be crucial. With the official end of the campaign on Friday and three days to go before the first round of voting, the French election is wrapped in tension and suspense, as the candidates -- from the far left to the far right -- struggle to win over the huge swath of voters who still declare themselves undecided or wavering.</p>
        <p>The unpredictability of the race was captured in a CSA poll to be published on Friday that shows Ms. Royal closing in on Mr. Sarkozy. Twenty-six percent of 1,002 registered voters polled this week said they intended to vote for Ms. Royal in the first round, compared with 27 percent for Mr. Sarkozy. The two candidates are running even in a hypothetical runoff, according to the poll.</p>
        <p>An IFOP poll to be published on Friday, however, puts Mr. Sarkozy at a comfortable margin of 28 percent in the first round, compared with 23 percent for Ms. Royal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy chose Marseille as his destination. His arms chopping the air, his fists clenched, his face bathed in sweat during a speech before 20,000 supporters, he dismissed the attacks of his opponents, saying he had been singled out because he dared to speak out on tough issues like crime, immigration, national identity and the need for authority.</p>
        <p>''When candidates have no ideas, no arguments, no convictions, when they believe in nothing,'' he said, they ''have no other option than insult, lies and insinuation.''</p>
        <p>He quoted King's ''I Have a Dream'' speech, painting an impressionistic view of the France of the future. ''I want to be the president who will make a new French dream live, thanks to which every French person will look to the future not as a threat, but as a promise,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Apparently confident he will make it into the second round, he did not specifically ask the French to vote for him. The first round, he said, is ''only a warm-up.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Royal took her last rally to Toulouse, in the south, where she appeared before 17,000 supporters side by side with Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero of Spain, a Socialist.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Sarkozy, she was not reluctant to ask the French for their votes in the first round.</p>
        <p>''Help me, carry me,'' Ms. Royal urged, her arms stretched out to the cheering crowd. ''It's with you that we will win.'' She added, ''I ask all citizens on the left to massively unite before the first round.''</p>
        <p>The Socialists are determined to avoid a repetition of the first round of the 2002 election when Mr. Le Pen beat out the Socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin, for second place.</p>
        <p>Ms. Royal has never been particularly warm toward the United States, and she was applauded and cheered when she announced, ''We will not genuflect before George Bush.''</p>
        <p>After the cheers subsided, she said, ''In Europe we will defend the emergence of a multipolar world, safe from imperial temptations of another age.''</p>
        <p>It was an obvious reference to Mr. Sarkozy, who has been criticized severely by his political opponents for proclaiming his admiration for the United States and meeting and asking for his photograph to be taken with Mr. Bush in the White House last September.</p>
        <p>Underscoring the concern that Mr. Le Pen could once again prevail and make it into the second round, a front-page editorial in the newspaper Le Monde on Thursday afternoon urged voters to choose either Mr. Sarkozy or Ms. Royal on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Without endorsing either of the candidates, the editorial argued that it was important that voters not throw away their votes but give the country two substantial and meaningfully different options for president.</p>
        <p>''It is important that in the second round, our 'old and dear country' can say clearly where it wants to go,'' the editorial said, adding that the first round must lay the groundwork for ''a clear and grand confrontation between two visions of society.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bayrou lashed out at the newspaper at his campaign rally, in Pau, in southwestern France.</p>
        <p>''How dare you say we should suppress the first round of the presidential election and go straight to the second round'' he declared. ''What arrogance!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bayrou, who in some polls beats both Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Royal in a second-round head-to-head contest, denounced what he called the ''collusion'' of the two main parties to hold on to power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Le Pen, who spoke from Nice, where the National Front enjoys strong support, was full of ad hominem attacks.</p>
        <p>He criticized Ms. Royal for promoting ''Socialism with a tender face'' and for never marrying François Hollande, the head of the Socialist Party and the father of their four children. He said they set a ''deplorable example with their structureless family.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Sarkozy, Mr. Le Pen denounced him as a candidate who ''changes his ideas like his shirts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy is the son of a Hungarian immigrant father and a French mother whose father was a Greek Jew who converted to Catholicism. Mr. Le Pen has accused Mr. Sarkozy of not being worthy of becoming president because he is a product of privilege and not French enough.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Sarkozy, the world does not revolve around your little person,'' Mr. Le Pen said at a rally on Sunday. ''Long before your parents came from Hungary or Greece, there was at the heart of the French people a national current that cared more about the interests of the country than about its ruling class.''</p>
        <p>In an interview with the Israeli daily Maariv, published on Thursday, Mr. Le Pen noted that he had many Jewish friends, Jews in his party and considerable Jewish support, but added that Mr. Sarkozy ''is Jewish through his mother.''</p>
        <p>''This plays a little in his favor,'' Mr. Le Pen said.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Sarkozy's lead in the polls, he is not well liked and has increasingly been the target of what is called the anti-Sarkozy movement. His posters throughout the country have been defaced, his face given a Hitlerian mustache or Dracula fangs.</p>
        <p>To counter the negative images, the Sarkozy campaign on Thursday called on supporters around the country to organize festive events. The color blue is the motif: the operation's official Web site features a blue sandwich and penne pasta soaked in blue ink.</p>
        <p>The campaign is sending up blue helium balloons with the words ''Sunday, I vote Sarko'' over the Jura mountains in eastern France. In outdoor markets in Rodez, in central France, Sarkozy boosters will offer locally made blue cheese free to passers-by.</p>

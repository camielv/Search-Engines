        <p>Columbia University notified more than 300 students and 2,000 alumni this week that their names and Social Security numbers had been ''inadvertently placed'' on a Columbia Web server that was not fully protected. Robert Hornsby, a university spokesman, said the information was removed quickly after a student came across it on a Columbia housing lottery Web site and notified university officials. Mr. Hornsby said that Columbia had been excising unneeded Social Security numbers from its files in recent years, and that although exposure to the information had been limited, subscriptions to a credit-monitoring system for those affected has been arranged.</p>

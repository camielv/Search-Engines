        <p>To the Editor: Re ''A Little Luxe on the Jersey Shore'' (April 13): My great-grandmother, Esther Teitelman, would have been thrilled to hear Curtis Bashaw has tricked out the Virginia Hotel in Cape May with leopard-patterned rugs and hand-pressed Belgian linen sheets. I've been told that she owned the hotel around the start of the 20th century, having learned her inn-keeping skills from her parents, who owned a coaching stop outside Vilnius, Lithuania.</p>
        <p>For the Virginia and other properties she had in Cape May, she believed, like Mr. Bashaw, in stylish, up-to-date furnishings. Her lobby chairs were painted high-gloss white and upholstered in rich stripes. Her beds were sized for a king and dressed with fancy handmade linens. How well they all go in my suburban New Jersey home!</p>

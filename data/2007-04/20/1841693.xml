        <p>NBC News fought back yesterday against a growing backlash over the way it handled the pictures and writings of the student who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech.</p>
        <p>Steve Capus, the president of NBC News, strongly defended the network's decision to broadcast the material.</p>
        <p>''The news-value question is long gone,'' Mr. Capus said. ''Every journalist is united on this. You can tell by their actions.'' He referred to the widespread use of the material NBC released by virtually every other news organization in the country.</p>
        <p>Still, NBC announced early in the day that it would limit its use of the images across NBC News, including MSNBC, to no more than 10 percent of its airtime.</p>
        <p>NBC received a package in the mail Wednesday from the gunman, Cho Seung-Hui. The material included 23 pages of writing and photographs and videos on DVD. Mr. Cho made rambling threats and was depicted brandishing guns and other weapons.</p>
        <p>Families of some of the victims, some law enforcement officials and executives from competing television news organizations have accused NBC of being insensitive or exploitative in the way it presented the materials on the air.</p>
        <p>But in an interview, Mr. Capus described a daylong process of evaluation on Wednesday, involving numerous NBC executives and news staff members, some of whom, including Matt Lauer, the ''Today'' show anchor, expressed some reservations about putting the statements of a mass killer on television.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lauer said on his program yesterday, ''Let's be honest, there are some big differences of opinion right within this news division as to whether we should be airing this stuff at all, whether we're taking the right course of action.''</p>
        <p>Numerous NBC executives had been involved in the process, Mr. Capus said, including the president of the company, Jeff Zucker, and the head of its standards division, David McCormick. Along with the management and many of the staff members of the news division they had weighed all the factors before deciding how to proceed, Mr. Capus said.</p>
        <p>''It's not every day we get a story like this,'' Mr. Capus said. ''We went over it for seven and a half hours. We didn't rush it on the air. We weren't promoting it. We weren't trumpeting it all day. It was extraordinary, and that's how we treated it.''</p>
        <p>One law enforcement official said that the F.B.I. had not publicly taken issue with NBC's decision to broadcast the material because it was not the agency's place. ''It was their property, and it was sent to them,'' the official said, referring to NBC. ''And they're in the news business.''</p>
        <p>F.B.I. agents sought to determine whether the package contained material beyond what might have been recovered in Virginia. Mr. Capus said the network had expected some of the criticism heard yesterday from family members and friends of the victims -- in one example several family members canceled an appearance on ''Today'' to protest the network's use of the material.</p>
        <p>Of the comments by family members and police officials, Mr. Capus said, ''It is understandable and not surprising given the horrific experience they have all been through.''</p>
        <p>NBC was more surprised at the criticism from Col. Steve Flaherty of the Virginia State Police, who after praising the network's handling of the material on Wednesday said yesterday that he was disappointed that it had broadcast it. But Mr. Capus said that, too, might be expected given the way the events have rocked the Virginia Tech community.</p>
        <p>But upon hearing that executives at other television news organizations had accused NBC of exploiting the material for its own advantage, Mr. Capus said, ''I chalk that up to competitive silliness.''</p>
        <p>Two of those competitors, ABC and CBS, led their newscasts last night with the backlash against the use of the images from the mailing, with ABC's report specifically taking NBC to task for ''promoting their pictures before their actual release.''</p>
        <p>In interviews yesterday several competitors questioned some of NBC's decisions concerning the way it distributed the images, which went out accompanied by a list of rules for how they could be used, including points like: ''No Internet use. No archival use. Do not resell,'' and ''Mandatory credit; NBC News.''</p>
        <p>The chief source of complaint about NBC seemed to be that it had failed to understand how extraordinary and sensitive the images really were, and that it erred in treating them like a news exclusive.</p>
        <p>Paul Friedman, the vice president of CBS News, said NBC had not done enterprise reporting to come into possession of this material, but had ''picked it up in its mailroom.''</p>
        <p>And while the rules about usage were fairly standard for the television news business, Mr. Friedman said that ''in this instance it seemed inappropriate'' for NBC to be so proprietary about material of such sensitive nature.</p>
        <p>One aspect that clearly irritated many of NBC's competitors was the impression of the logo ''NBC News,'' which the network burned into every image from the material. Mr. Friedman of CBS said he had thought about calling NBC executives Wednesday night to suggest they remove the logo simply to distance the network from the material. ''It may backfire for them to be so closely associated with footage that makes people's flesh crawl,'' Mr. Friedman said.</p>
        <p>But NBC had supporters as well. Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, said, ''NBC was obviously very sensitive.'' He added, ''While reasonable people may disagree, it was clear they were trying to exercise restraint.''</p>

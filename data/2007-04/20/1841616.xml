        <p>There comes a moment in a Marx Brothers movie when everything comes to a dead stop so the young lovers can sing. Some are nebbishes, like Kenny Baker in ''At the Circus,'' while others are just creepy, like Tony Martin in ''The Big Store,'' but they are all painful to watch. I don't know how audiences in the 1930's, unable to fast-forward, handled the interludes. Maybe they picked up their knitting, or waited things out in the lobby.</p>
        <p>But there is an exception. Kitty Carlisle (not yet Hart) in ''A Night at the Opera,'' is neither simpering nor soporific. She is Rosa Castaldi, a gifted soprano gutsy enough to tell Italy's greatest tenor, Rodolfo Lassparri, to take a hike so she can go to dinner with her chorus-member boyfriend, Ricardo Baroni. Baroni, played by Allan Jones, could have been just another sickly stiff, but he, too, upends very low expectations by bopping Lassparri on the jaw. He also downs several pounds of spaghetti and leads a boatload of Italian peasants in one of the Marx Brothers' signature ethnic-stereotype production numbers. Miss Carlisle has her own big song, ''Alone,'' which she sings to Ricardo at dockside. It's weepy, but even it has a pleasing bite: she sings knowing that she is irritating the oily Lassparri, who has just blown off his fans' pleas for a song by faking laryngitis. You go, Rosa!</p>

        <p>Kitty Carlisle Hart, who died on Tuesday, had a life of great wit, splendor and good works. Her movie career wasn't much, but she was one of the best straight women the Marx Brothers ever had, which counts for a lot.</p>
        <p>''The loudest and funniest screen comedy of the winter season,'' The Times's critic said of ''A Night at the Opera'' in 1935. He was right, but he missed a few things. The world has come to recognize one particular gag, for example -- when a crowd of Marxes, manicurists, cleaning ladies, engineers, engineers' assistants and stewards bearing hard-boiled eggs packs into Groucho's shoebox stateroom -- as one of the funniest in film history. Our critic overlooked it. And while he praised ''that fine and gracious stooge,'' Margaret Dumont, he failed to single out Miss Carlisle.</p>
        <p>Here, then, to correct an old omission, a thankful toast: Raise a Chianti bottle and a salami to the lovely Rosa Castaldi, Manhattan's own Kitty Carlisle Hart, who helped make ''A Night at the Opera'' watchable, all the way through.</p>

        <p>''We gather here with a rare opportunity to straddle the chasms of race and class that have at times been so wide in this country and in this city,'' Mayor Amicone told a crowd of civil rights activists, housing advocates and local officials during a signing ceremony at City Hall, before the private cigar celebration in his wood-paneled office. ''We finally have the freedom to choose our own destiny. And knowing this, we have the confidence that our choice will be right.''</p>

        <p>After 27 years of contentious court battles over housing segregation, this city's mayor, Philip A. Amicone, and Herman Keith, a former president of the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter, shared cigars on Thursday as they celebrated the settlement of a lawsuit that had pitted neighbor against neighbor in bitter protests.</p>
        <p>''We gather here with a rare opportunity to straddle the chasms of race and class that have at times been so wide in this country and in this city,'' Mayor Amicone told a crowd of civil rights activists, housing advocates and local officials during a signing ceremony at City Hall, before the private cigar celebration in his wood-paneled office. ''We finally have the freedom to choose our own destiny. And knowing this, we have the confidence that our choice will be right.''</p>
        <p>Karen Edmonson, the current president of the Yonkers chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which filed the lawsuit in 1980, said the event marked ''the ceremonial ending to a long, hard struggle.''</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, which contended that city housing policies separated poor black and Hispanic residents from their white, more affluent counterparts, opened an ugly chapter in the city's history, tearing apart neighborhoods, building and destroying political careers and unleashing a heated court battle that nearly drove Yonkers to bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>At issue was the construction of 800 units of public and affordable housing in eastern Yonkers, which is predominantly white and middle-class. The homes were meant to lodge low-income minority families who had long been confined to the housing projects and subsidized apartments squeezed in the city's southwestern quadrant, which borders the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who has presided over the lawsuit since its onset, when he had just one year on the bench, will hold a final hearing in the case on May 1. He is expected to announce then whether he approves of the settlement.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on the case, the longest of his career, Judge Sand said in an interview: ''Any efforts not to comply with the law are counterproductive to the image of the community and its well-being. The millions and millions of dollars that the City of Yonkers has spent'' in this litigation, he added, ''could have gone to better things for the community.''</p>
        <p>The last of the 600 affordable homes, whose rents and mortgages are subsidized in part by the city, are expected to be occupied this summer on East Grassy Sprain Road, four years behind the schedule laid out in a 1996 federal court order. According to the order, Yonkers was to have made 100 units of affordable housing, in new and existing buildings, available each year for six years.</p>
        <p>One reason for the delay, according to Michael Sussman, a lawyer who represents the plaintiffs in the case, was that city officials authorized low-income white families who lived in southwest Yonkers to move into some of these units, defying the intent of the order, which was to bring minority families to the east side of town.</p>
        <p>''At the heart of this lawsuit were core constitutional values, but when it takes over 20 years to validate these values, it's as if you were devaluing the values,'' Mr. Sussman said in an interview. ''I certainly sympathize with those in the minority community who feel nothing celebratory toward this, but feel very frustrated instead.''</p>
        <p>Judge Sand ruled against Yonkers in 1985, saying that the city had engaged in a pattern of discrimination against some of its poorest, most vulnerable residents. At first, members of the City Council seemed willing to negotiate a settlement, but some of them bowed under public pressure, leading to a long -- and expensive --legal showdown.</p>
        <p>In 1988, after Judge Sand imposed contempt-of-court fines that doubled every day, the Council acquiesced and voted to approve the court-ordered desegregation plan. By the time of the vote, though, Yonkers had already racked up $819,000 in nonrefundable fines. If the plan had not been approved, the city would have had to lay off hundreds of workers to pay the mounting fines.</p>
        <p>''It was a tumultuous time,'' said Angelo R. Martinelli, who was elected mayor in 1982, inheriting the litigation, and who attributes his re-election loss in 1984 to his support of a settlement. ''This is a great day,'' he said on Thursday. ''But the truth is, this day should have happened 20 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Mary Dorman, who has lived with her husband, Bud, in a modest brick house in eastern Yonkers since before the lawsuit was filed, was at first one of the most active and vociferous opponents of the construction of public housing on her side of town. She picketed the federal courthouse in Manhattan and attended most of the City Council meetings at which matters related to the court's desegregation order were discussed or put to a vote.</p>
        <p>But once she met the first tenants of the town-house-style public housing project built a few blocks from her home, Mrs. Dorman began to change her mind, she said, deciding that it was better to welcome her new neighbors than to alienate them.</p>
        <p>She did not attend the ceremony on Thursday -- ''I had other plans,'' she said -- but acknowledged the significance of the moment, saying: ''Yonkers learned a lesson, on all sides. We all learned something.''</p>
        <p>''In a sense, the desegregation plan did work,'' she added. ''It didn't spoil our neighborhoods; we had a lot of nice people who lived there. It wasn't the horror that we all thought it was going to be.''</p>

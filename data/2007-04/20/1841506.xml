        <p>The latest production of the young theater company Coyote REP will have an unusual opening on Sunday, taking place not onstage but online at the group's Web site. ''Patriot Act (An Occurrence at Yankee Stadium),'' an absurdist dark comedy by Robert Emmet Lunney, is the second recorded sound play Coyote REP has offered, and it will be followed on June 24 by a third, Douglas Braverman's ''Boy at the Window'' (with, from left above, Glenn Kalison, Emily Rogge, Rebecca Tourino and Brandon Collinsworth). In total, the company's inaugural season includes four sound plays, one stage play (a recent production of ''The Naked Eye Planets'' by Ms. Tourino) and several ''webisodes'' -- mock documentaries about company members. (One claims to be America's greatest playwright though he has yet to write a play.) Six of these are available online. ''It's a way to let our audience get to know the company,'' said Mr. Kalison, the producing director. ''There's something about that mystique of seeing people on the screen and then going to see them in a theater that sells tickets.'' At a recent recording session, actors recorded ''The Boy at the Window,'' and Mr. Kalison discussed the company's approach. ''We call them sound plays because when you think of radio plays, you think about nostalgic old mysteries and horror of the '40s and '50s, and that's not what we're doing,'' he said. ''We're recreating the form.'' Is this a sign that live theater of the future will no longer be live? Jeanne LaSala, the artistic director, said that while it was certainly cheaper to produce sound plays, Coyote REP was not trying to replace the live experience. ''I think it just opens more possibilities rather than closing the door on anything,'' she said. ''The stage productions are an important part of our mission and what we hope to keep doing.'' For now, the sound plays certainly have an appealing ticket price: they are free (coyoterep.org).</p>

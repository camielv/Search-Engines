        <p>Tenafly High School will be closed today, the eighth anniversary of the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, after the discovery of threatening graffiti yesterday afternoon prompted an evacuation and search of the school, the Tenafly police said. Early yesterday morning, the police received a phone call saying that graffiti had been found on the inside of a school door. While the threat was vague, the date -- April 20, 2007 -- was not. The school was evacuated and the building searched with the help of a bomb-sniffing dog. Nothing was found and students were sent home at 12:15 p.m., the police said.</p>

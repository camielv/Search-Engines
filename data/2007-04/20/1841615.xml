        <p>Albert Murray, the cultural critic, novelist and poet, has been awarded the W. E. B. Du Bois medal by Harvard University's W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research. In announcing the award Friday, the institute's director, Henry Louis Gates Jr., noted Mr. Murray's ''contributions to the arts, culture and the life of the mind.'' Mr. Murray, 90, a Harlem resident, is the author of significant works of cultural criticism, among them ''The Omni-Americans: Black Experience and American Culture.'' His autobiographical novels include ''The Spyglass Tree.'' Erroll McDonald, his longtime editor, said, ''Albert Murray, the most elegant and conversationally engaging man I know, has been profoundly influential to a whole generation of blacks coming out of college in the 1970s and '80s.'' Toni Morrison, Aimé Cesaire, Wole Soyinka and Derek Walcott are among recent winners.</p>

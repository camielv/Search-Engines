        <p>PAGE--Gilbert E., on April 18, 2007. Beloved son of the late Fred and Carmen (Thompson) Page, and adoring grandson of the late Jessie Thompson. Gil is survived by his devoted long-time partner Frank Friuli with whom he shared a 46 year loving relationship. Gil is further survived by his adoring sister Sharon (Glen) Anderson and his devoted brothers Norman (Elaine) Page and Brent (Diane) Page and their families, all of whom were most dear to Gil. Gil was predeceased by his brother Philip Page, a renowned educator in the Denver Public School System. Finally, Gil leaves behind thousands of wonderful students with whom he came in contact during a twenty-five year outstanding career as a Guidance Counselor in the Bellmore-Merrick (L.I., N.Y.) High School District. In lieu of flowers, it was Gil's wish that memorial donations be made to a charity of your choosing. A wake will be held at the Wantagh Abbey Funeral Home, 3374 Park Ave., Wantagh, NY 11793 on Saturday and Sunday from 24 and 7-9 pm with a religious service to be conducted at the Abbey on Sunday, April 22, 2007 at 8 pm. Cremation will be private.</p>

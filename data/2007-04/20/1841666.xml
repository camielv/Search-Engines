        <p>A picture caption on Wednesday about the temporary eviction of Iraqi civilians by the United States Marines as they fight insurgents in Iraq's Anbar Province misidentified the unit that commandeered the home of the two boys shown in the photograph. It is the Second Battalion, Seventh Marine regiment -- not Second Battalion, Seventh Division. (The Marine Corps does not have divisions.)</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 21, 2007, Saturday  A picture caption on Wednesday about the temporary eviction of Iraqi civilians by the United States Marines as they fight insurgents in Iraq's Anbar Province misidentified the unit that commandeered the home of the two boys shown in the photograph. It is the Second Battalion, Seventh Marine regiment -- not the Second Battalion, Seventh Division. A correction in this space yesterday referred incorrectly in some copies to the structure of the Marine Corps. It does indeed have divisions. (They are the First, Second, Third and Fourth.)</p>

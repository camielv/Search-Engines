        <p>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Rafal Zielinski  103 minutes</p>
        <p>A hackneyed melodrama partly redeemed by a cast convinced that it's performing Tennessee Williams, ''Downtown: A Street Tale'' follows a bunch of stereotypically damaged people in an abandoned building in New York. Rehashing characters and plots from the ''Law &amp; Order'' playbook, the director, Rafal Zielinski, supplements his material with religious iconography and more gauzy close-ups than a Barbra Streisand marathon.

        <p>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Rafal Zielinski  103 minutes</p>
        <p>A hackneyed melodrama partly redeemed by a cast convinced that it's performing Tennessee Williams, ''Downtown: A Street Tale'' follows a bunch of stereotypically damaged people in an abandoned building in New York. Rehashing characters and plots from the ''Law &amp; Order'' playbook, the director, Rafal Zielinski, supplements his material with religious iconography and more gauzy close-ups than a Barbra Streisand marathon. Prostitution, heroin and mental impairment have never looked so pretty.</p>
        <p>Acting as surrogate parents to this makeshift family are Angelo (Joey Dedio, who also wrote the story), the oldest-looking rent boy in town, and Aimee (Genevi√®ve Bujold), a saintly shelter proprietor. Burt Young and John Savage also show up briefly -- as a genial sugar daddy and a wheelchair-bound pimp -- and Martin Scorsese's daughter, Domenica Cameron Scorsese, appears in a central role as a pregnant runaway. No amount of name recognition, however, can distract from the script's banalities; this tale, set at Christmas, is like a cross between ''West Side Story'' and a Nativity play.</p>
        <p>Filmed in 2004 and only now drifting into limited release, ''Downtown: A Street Tale'' presents its broken protagonists as fallen angels, complete with fuzzy halos. In these not-so-mean streets, salvation is only a cinematographer away.</p>
        <p>JEANNETTE CATSOULIS</p>
        <p>''Downtown: A Street Tale'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has shooting up, beating up and a whole bunch of acting up.</p>

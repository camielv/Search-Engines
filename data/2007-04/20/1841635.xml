        <p>Sacyr Vallehermoso, a Spanish construction company, bid 9.75 billion euros ($13.26 billion) to take over Eiffage of France, a diversified construction company that built the Eiffel Tower, setting the stage for a cross-border struggle for control of the company. The bid came less than 24 hours after a shareholders' meeting where Eiffage blocked Sacyr's request for seats on its board, even though Sacyr holds a 33 percent stake. Sacyr offered 12 of its shares for every five of Eiffage, valuing the stock at 104.69 euros, a 6 percent discount to its closing price Wednesday. Sacyr's approach pits the builder against Eiffage, which views itself as a venerable part of the French establishment.</p>

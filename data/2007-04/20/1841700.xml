        <p>Firefighters rescued two window washers who were stranded on a scaffold in Turtle Bay yesterday morning, the Fire Department said. Firefighters received a report about 8 a.m. that two workers, who were not named by the department, were stuck on a scaffold outside the 37th floor at 747 Third Avenue, fire officials said. Firefighters used ropes to secure the scaffold to the building and, after cutting out a window, a firefighter stepped onto the scaffold to guide the workers to safety. No one was injured, fire officials said.</p>

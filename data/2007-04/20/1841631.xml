        <p>Tilton Gallery  8 East 76th Street, Manhattan  Through May 5</p>
        <p>Most contemporary art comes partly from other art. One way to assess the health of something new is to subtract all the visible influences, precedents and received ideas and see if there is any pulse left. Unpack the images in the first New York show of the French artist Delphine Courtillot, and barely a flicker remains, but a flicker is better than nothing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Courtillot makes large watercolors based on staged photographs of one or two people in desolate landscapes at night. She uses bright lights that blanch the skin and flatten space and, coupled with the unconventional dress or poses of the figures, create ambiguous scenes that alternate between contemporary fairy tale and garden-variety adolescent wilding.</p>
        <p>Sound familiar? The parsing could include Winston O. Link, Anna Gaskell, Justine Kurland, Aida Ruilova, Ryan McGinley, Tim Davis, Amy Adler and ''The Blair Witch Project.''</p>
        <p>None of this is necessarily fatal. The main problem is that it is unclear what is accomplished by the workmanlike, uninflected translations of the photographic images into watercolor, especially since they look better in reproduction -- and nearly like photographs. Ms. Courtillot may disdain photography, but she does not yet have a convincing replacement.</p>

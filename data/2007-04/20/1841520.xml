        <p>10 P.M. (ABC) PLANET EARTH 2007: SEVEN WAYS TO HELP SAVE THE WORLD -- In honor of Earth Day, ABC News anchors and correspondents will report live from all seven continents throughout the day, supplemented by this ''20/20'' special in which seven environmental experts discuss the biggest problems facing the planet and some possible solutions. Elizabeth Vargas will report from an African game preserve, Chris Cuomo will travel to Paris, John Quinones will explore the Brazilian rain forest, Cynthia McFadden will journey to China, and Bill Weir will explore the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. There'll even be one live report from the South Pole.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CMT) THE ULTIMATE COYOTE UGLY SEARCH -- Lil holds her final open auditions in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (TCM) OLIVER TWIST (1948) TCM presents two British films, starting with this superb David Lean adaptation of the Dickens novel. John Howard Davies plays the title role, but it's Alec Guinness who stands out as the archetypal gang leader, Fagin. At 10, James Mason portrays a wounded Irish rebel who goes into hiding after a botched robbery in ''Odd Man Out'' (1947). Kathleen Ryan plays the woman who chases after him in the streets of Belfast in this drama from Carol Reed.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TLC) WHAT NOT TO WEAR -- Kim Shults, a 33-year-old swimming instructor, is training to become a personal life coach. But her beach-bound wardrobe is hardly confidence-inspiring. Stacy and Clinton help her help herself.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (BBC America) CLATTERFORD CHRISTMAS SPECIAL -- Yes, it's April. But this special, originally broadcast in December in Britain, is only now making its way to the United States. So let's pretend. Tonight the Women's Guild, above, prepares to put on its holiday production of ''Cinderella,'' and Tash (Sally Phillips) is expecting to play the lead, as she always does, even though Sal (Sue Johnston) thinks she may be a little too old. That leaves James (David Mitchell) and the Vicar (Patrick Barlow) to play the ugly stepsisters. Tip (Pauline McLynn) would rather spend time at the pub than play the wicked stepmother.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (A&amp;E) INTERVENTION -- Trent, a former chef, has catered to presidents and Hollywood royalty. But as a child of alcoholics, his early years were rife with violence and abuse, and he turned to drugs for relief. Today Trent is a homeless heroin addict. In this episode his friends and family try to help him put his life together.</p>
        <p>MIDNIGHT (HBO) P. DIDDY PRESENTS THE BAD BOYS OF COMEDY -- P. Diddy, left, makes an appearance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on behalf of tonight's stand-up men, Mike Yard, Doo-Doo Brown, Todd Lynn and Donnell Rawlings. The rapper Doug E. Fresh introduces the acts; DJ Mister Cee keeps things hip-hopping.</p>

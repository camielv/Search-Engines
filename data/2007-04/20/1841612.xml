        <p>The adventures of Spider-Man have graced comic books, cartoons and live-action films. Now Peter Parker's tale of great power and great responsibility is being developed for the Great White Way. Days after a casting agent's description of roles was picked up by a Web site devoted to comic book news, Marvel Studios confirmed plans for the musical, which will be directed by Julie Taymor and have music and lyrics provided by Bono and the Edge of the band U2. The statement from Marvel indicated that a reading would take place this summer. There is no confirmed date for a Broadway opening.</p>

        <p>China Dabbles in Openness While Rejecting Democracy  While China is not embracing Western-style democracy, the government has permitted a relatively open round of political discussion, as President Hu Jintao and other top leaders seek to cast themselves as progressives who are open-minded about ways to improve government practices, political experts say.</p>

        <p>U.S. Releases Anti-Castro Exile  The United States freed on bail Luis Posada Carriles, the anti-Castro Cuban exile and former C.I.A. operative linked to the bombing of a Cuban airliner, and sent him to Miami for a fraud trial.

Gates arrived in Iraq to pressure Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to move faster on Sunni-Shiite reconciliation at a moment when Mr. Maliki's ability to deliver appears limited. But the visit is more likely to highlight the different political realities that drive the American and Iraqi governments.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>As Congressional Democrats sought to reconcile their differences and send an Iraq spending bill to the White House, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said that ''this war is lost,'' an assessment that Republicans said would demoralize American troops.</p>
        <p>A12</p>

        <p>NATIONAL A14-21</p>
        <p>Panel Questions Gonzales Over Attorney Firings  Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales endured withering questioning from Senate Judiciary Committee members who expressed grave doubts about his truthfulness and judgment in the firing of federal prosecutors.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Virginia Tech Defends Decision  Officials at Virginia Tech defended their decision to allow Cho Seung-Hui to return to campus after he was released from a psychiatric facility, even though they knew of his troubled mental history and potential for violence.  A21</p>
        <p>House Passes Voting Bill  The House passed legislation that would award the residents of the nation's capital a full voting representative in Congress.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>Drexel May Face Lawsuit  Andrew M. Cuomo, New York's attorney general, notified Drexel University that he intends to sue it for deceptive business practices, the first time he has singled out a university for a lawsuit in his investigation of the college loan industry.</p>

        <p>Bloomberg Plans to Outline A Green Vision for New York  Mayor Bloomberg will call on Sunday for a raft of proposals intended to ease traffic congestion, reduce air pollution, build housing, improve mass transit and develop abandoned industrial land as the city's population grows by an expected one million over the next two decades. A1</p>
        <p>Ex-Judge Guilty of Bribery  Gerald P. Garson, a former State Supreme Court judge, was convicted of accepting bribes to manipulate the outcome of divorce cases in a case that led to a political and judicial corruption inquiry in Brooklyn. B1</p>
        <p>Corzine's Judgment at Issue  Residents of New Jersey, despite their outpouring of sympathy and well wishes for Gov. Jon S. Corzine after his devastating car crash, also harbor resentment and anger for what they see as a serious lapse in judgment: failing to wear a seat belt and allowing his driver to go well above the speed limit.

        <p>Contraceptive Pill Under Fire  The complex love-hate relationships that women have with their monthly menstruation has fueled controversy over a expected decision by the Food and Drug Administration to approve a contraceptive pill that eliminates periods for as long as a woman takes it.</p>

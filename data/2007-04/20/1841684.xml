        <p>The Rangers completed their four-game sweep of Atlanta in the first round of the playoffs in varying degrees of exhaustion, particularly having played Games 3 and 4 on back-to-back nights at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>The team's older veterans laughed at the suggestion that there is a downside to a long layoff, while they wait for their second-round opponent to emerge from the other Eastern Conference series.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad it's over, especially the back-to-back games,'' Jaromir Jagr, who frequently reminds people that he is 35 years old, said after the game Wednesday night. ''I was so tired the whole night. I had a choice, cry or smile. So I was smiling.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers took a hard-earned day off yesterday and will watch the rest of the first round play out. Because the N.H.L. reseeds its playoff teams after every round, the Rangers can play any one of four opponents. But the most likely situation is that they will meet No. 1-seeded Buffalo or No. 4 Ottawa. Their second-round series would probably not start until Wednesday, and the sixth-seeded Rangers would again begin on the road.</p>
        <p>The Sabres would present a daunting matchup because the Rangers lost all four regular-season meetings between the teams, although two were in overtime and one was in a shootout. Goalie Kevin Weekes, the backup at the time, played three of those four games, instead of the starter, Henrik Lundqvist.</p>
        <p>The Rangers went 1-3 against the Senators, with all of the games decided by two goals or fewer.</p>
        <p>But the Sabres have not played the Rangers since Dec. 1, and the Senators have played the Rangers only once since the All-Star Game break, which means those games came before the Rangers reached their current form. Since the beginning of February, the Rangers have been transformed. The Thrashers, who went 3-1 against the Rangers in the regular season only to be pummeled out of the first round, found that out the hard way.</p>
        <p>The Rangers produced the only first-round sweep in either conference.</p>
        <p>''Things don't always go as you expect,'' Lundqvist said. ''It's been intense for the last couple of weeks and months. I think we really got together as a group and realized how we have to play to have success as a group. The key for us is to keep doing it over and over again.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers' commitment to their style as a tough, cohesive, defensive team received a few boosts along the way, particularly with the arrival of forward Sean Avery in a trade in early February. They worked two rookies into the lineup, forward Ryan Callahan and defenseman Dan Girardi, acquired defenseman Paul Mara at the trading deadline and benefited from the return of forward Brendan Shanahan, who was out for a month after sustaining a concussion.</p>
        <p>Put it all together, and they became tougher as well as faster, which is crucial against the speedy Sabres or the explosive Senators. The Rangers are also riding a hot streak by Lundqvist, who had the best goals against average and save percentage of any goalie since the All-Star Game break.</p>
        <p>''I think our goalie is maybe the biggest difference,'' center Matt Cullen said. ''He's been unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers should also have defenseman Karel Rachunek back after he missed the last 12 games of the regular season and the first round with a sprained knee ligament. He is the last of the Rangers' injured players to return.</p>
        <p>That gives Coach Tom Renney the flexibility with his defensemen that he has been enjoying since the return of all of his forwards.</p>
        <p>What emerged in the first round was the way the Rangers' top three lines can have an impact in different types of games. The top line -- Jagr, Michael Nylander and Marcel Hossa -- took over Games 1 and 3 with its puck-handling dominance and scoring. The line of Avery, Shanahan and Martin Straka came through in the tighter-checking games. And the line of Cullen, Callahan and Petr Prucha is fast and forechecks hard, so it gives an opponent no time to exhale when it hops on the ice. Cullen drove that point home with his game-winning goal in Game 4.</p>
        <p>''Everybody on the team is important,'' said Jagr, the Rangers' captain. ''One line can't win a series. It can win a couple of games, but not a series. We have confidence in all our guys.''</p>
        <p>That confidence will have to simmer for the next few days while the other playoff teams earn their way into the second round. The Rangers know they will have to guard against complacency.</p>
        <p>But the older players, the ones who savor the chance to rest, are also the ones to remind the team what is to come.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy right now, but if I lose next round, I'm not going to be happy,'' Jagr said.</p>
        <p>''Bottom line: You get something, you want more.''</p>

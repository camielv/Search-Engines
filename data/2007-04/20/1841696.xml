        <p>The name of the radical black activist Sonny Carson, left, was removed from a list of 53 names in a street-naming bill yesterday after a racially charged City Council committee hearing. Mr. Carson, who died in 2002, was an ex-convict who became a community advocate and anti-drug crusader, but he was also known as an unabashed racist. Councilman Albert Vann, a Brooklyn Democrat who put Mr. Carson's name on the list, said that despite Mr. Carson's sometimes hateful attitudes, he had also helped his Brooklyn community, and it should be up to the community to decide whose names adorn its streets. (Indeed, Community Board 3 of Brooklyn voted in favor of naming four blocks of Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant Sonny Abubadika Carson Avenue.) But the Council's Parks and Recreation Committee voted 3 to 1 with one abstention to remove Mr. Carson's name from the list. The vote was followed by a brief scuffle as security officers removed protesters trying to unfurl a banner in the chamber. The amended bill will now go the full Council for a vote.</p>

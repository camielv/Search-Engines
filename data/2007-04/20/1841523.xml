        <p>Like so many works now secure in their public approval, Brahms's Violin Concerto was initially scorned after its premiere in 1879, with the conductor Hans von Bülow supposedly declaring that it was not a concerto for violin, but rather one ''against the violin.''</p>
        <p>In response, the violinist Bronislaw Huberman joked that the piece was ''a concerto for violin against orchestra -- and the violin wins.''</p>

        <p>Like so many works now secure in their public approval, Brahms's Violin Concerto was initially scorned after its premiere in 1879, with the conductor Hans von Bülow supposedly declaring that it was not a concerto for violin, but rather one ''against the violin.''</p>
        <p>In response, the violinist Bronislaw Huberman joked that the piece was ''a concerto for violin against orchestra -- and the violin wins.''</p>
        <p>Julia Fischer, the young German violinist, certainly gave a winning performance when she played the concerto on Wednesday with the New York Philharmonic and Lorin Maazel. Her appearance was part of an ongoing Philharmonic festival called Brahms the Romantic, which is offering all of the composer's major orchestral works. Ms. Fischer will also perform the concerto with the Philharmonic during its European tour next month.</p>
        <p>She is one of a crop of prodigiously talented female violinists in their 20s, including Jennifer Koh, Hilary Hahn, Janine Jansen and Sarah Chang, who have played in New York recently. Hans von Bülow would no doubt be stunned by the ease and virtuosity with which these young women can tackle difficult works like the Brahms concerto.</p>
        <p>Dressed in a glittery, floor-length black gown, Ms. Fischer seemed confident and at ease as she vigorously attacked the first measures after a spacious, elegant orchestral opening. Her tone was burnished in the virtuosic passages and richly sweet in the more lyrical rhapsodic moments. She played the cadenza by Joseph Joachim, the Hungarian violinist who advised Brahms about the work and gave it its premiere, with seamless technique.</p>
        <p>The performance sounded like a genial collaboration between orchestra and soloist, with the control shifting between the two just enough to keep things exciting. During the moments when Ms. Fischer wasn't playing, it seemed as if the orchestra was trying to woo her back with its warm, inviting sound.</p>
        <p>The concerto followed a lively performance of Brahms's cheery Academic Festival Overture, which opened the program. After intermission Mr. Maazel led the Philharmonic in a spacious, stirring, rhapsodic rendition of Brahms's Symphony No. 1, which the composer, a symphonic late bloomer, wrote in his 40s after finally overcoming his Beethoven inferiority complex.</p>
        <p>Brahms may have thought that his first symphony was ''not particularly lovable,'' but the audience at a remarkably full Avery Fisher Hall clearly begged to differ. A Brahms festival may not be innovative or daring, but it certainly pulls in the crowds.</p>

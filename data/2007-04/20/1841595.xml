      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Joe Trippi, a Democratic political consultant who ran Howard Dean's upstart presidential campaign in 2004, said Thursday that he had signed on with John Edwards in the 2008 race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trippi, who oversaw the pioneering presence on the Internet for Mr. Dean, the former Vermont governor, as well as his rise and fall, will be a senior adviser to Mr. Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Mr. Dean was the favored candidate of antiwar Democrats. This time, Mr. Edwards is seeking to fill that position in the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>In a blog posting Thursday on the Edwards campaign's Web site, Mr. Trippi, 51, said he had thought his campaign days were over but ''too much is at stake.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trippi, who was praised for elevating Mr. Dean from a little-known, small-state governor to a leading presidential contender, was also criticized by some Democrats for failing to run a disciplined, frugal campaign. The campaign spent $40 million but experienced humiliating defeats in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, leading to Mr. Trippi's resignation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trippi has worked in presidential politics nearly every four years since his first campaign in 1980, when he was an aide to Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. But his rise to prominence, particularly among Democratic loyalists in the blogosphere, came during the Dean campaign, where he developed something of a cult following.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Edwards, Mr. Trippi will be an adviser on media strategy and the Internet.</p>
        <p>By integrating social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace.com with traditional political campaigns, he said, the Web is shaping the 2008 race in far greater ways than it did four years ago.</p>
        <p>''As far as the Internet, this is still the wagon trains coming across the prairie,'' Mr. Trippi said in an interview Thursday. ''Everyone is still a pioneer out there. Everything is learn by doing it.''</p>
        <p>In the 2004 Democratic primary campaign, 650,000 people joined the Dean campaign's online community, and the Internet played a critical role in raising $59 million. This time, with the advent of video-sharing sites like YouTube, the Internet is expected to be more critical than ever.</p>
        <p>''You can't run a modern campaign in 2008 without a significant part of your media and communications happening over the Internet,'' Mr. Trippi said. ''The Edwards campaign is trying to take a bigger, bolder step.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trippi said he had had conversations with all the major Democratic candidates, but there were natural ties to Mr. Edwards. Matthew Gross, who oversees Internet operations at the Edwards campaign, worked for Mr. Trippi four years ago.</p>

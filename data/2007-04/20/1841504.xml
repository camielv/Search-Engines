        <p>William S. Hart, left, may be a permanent resident of Brooklyn -- he is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery -- but it's Queens that's giving him a celebration. A three-weekend tribute to Hart, a pioneering cowboy star, begins tomorrow at the Museum of the Moving Image with one of his best-known films, the 1916 ''Hell's Hinges,'' and continues through Sunday, May 6. A successful Broadway actor, Hart was well into middle age when he turned his attention to the movies, with the avowed intention of returning a measure of authenticity to a genre that had already earned a reputation for pulpy excess by the time of his arrival in 1914. There wasn't much excess in Hart: a stern, stone-faced man, he introduced a sense of moral exigency to the western, usually playing a character contemporary critics described as ''the good-bad man'': the outlaw who reveals himself a stronger and truer man than the law-abiding citizens who have rejected him. The series, to be introduced tomorrow by Diane Koszarski, the author of ''The Complete Films of William S. Hart,'' and the early-film scholar Richard Koszarski, includes several Hart classics, among them his spectacular farewell to the screen, ''Tumbleweeds'' (1925). There are also some striking oddities, like ''The Whistle'' (1921), in which Hart plays a socially conscious mill worker confronting the harsh realities of post-frontier capitalism. (35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us, $10.)</p>

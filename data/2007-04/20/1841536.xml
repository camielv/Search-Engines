        <p>Last year the Tribeca Film Festival had its big expansion, surging to 174 feature films shown at theaters far beyond TriBeCa. This year despite a slight contraction to 157 features -- about what it was two years ago -- the festival remains a daunting sprawl, reaching from Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan to the Upper East Side and up to the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights. Here are some suggestions for how to economize and get the most out of the festival, which opens Wednesday and runs through May 6. Full schedule and tickets: tribecafilmfestival.org.</p>
        <p>CONSIDER A PASS -- This year prices for most screenings have jumped 50 percent, to $18. Organizers say the additional revenue is needed to cover expenses -- outfitting dozens of theaters with digital projectors, for example -- and to defray a budget deficit. To soften the blow the festival offers various combo passes. At $1,100 the all-access Hudson Pass makes sense only for the most voracious film tourist. A $150 Daytimer Pass, for entry before 6 p.m. on weekdays and 4 p.m. on weekends, is a bargain for anyone planning to attend 10 or more screenings. Family packages are also available.</p>
        <p>FACTOR IN GEOGRAPHY -- All ticketholders must arrive 30 minutes before showtime or lose their seats, which is great news for anyone in a standby line. But with theaters across Manhattan it's best to plan a day's film outings -- ticketed or not -- for as few neighborhoods as possible.</p>
        <p>CONSIDER A MARATHON -- This year the festival is adding a new subseries, the Tribeca/ESPN Sports Film Festival, with 14 pictures. They are spread all over the schedule, but aficionados have a chance to see all the films on May 5 at the AMC Kips Bay Theater, on Second Avenue at 32nd Street. The 10 films in the family festival will be shown at the same theater tomorrow and Sunday.</p>
        <p>HIT THE DRIVE-IN (ON FOOT) -- Hustling around town and waiting on standby lines can be exhausting. A relaxing alternative is three so-called Drive-In screenings, outdoors on the World Financial Center Plaza beginning at dusk. The films this year are the 20th-anniversary rerelease of ''Dirty Dancing'' (Thursday), the new animated family comedy ''Surf's Up'' (next Friday) and the documentary ''Planet B-Boy'' (April 28). Most relaxing is the price: free.</p>

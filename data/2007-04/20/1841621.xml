        <p>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Leonardo Ricagni  In Spanish, with English subtitles  Not rated; 108 minutes</p>
        <p>''A Dios Momo,'' directed by Leonardo Ricagni, is to melodrama as corn syrup is to sweeteners: efficient but crude.</p>
        <p>The film follows the uplifting misadventures of Obdulio (Mathias Acuña), a sweet-tempered 11-year-old newspaper boy who lives with his grandmother (Carmen Abella), a saintly old woman who is mainly pictured praying, and saves his pennies to buy school uniforms for his sisters.</p>
        <p>Obdulio is illiterate and refuses to go to school, but he's obsessed with the Murgas, a troupe of traveling singers. This fascination blossoms into a willingness to learn when his newspaper's watchman, Barrilete (Jorge Esmoris), teaches him to read by dispatching him to the singers' practice room to scrawl Barrilete's lyrics on a chalkboard.</p>
        <p>This fairy-tale touch might work if the movie weren't so eager to imitate the stalest aspects of the director's chief inspiration, Federico Fellini. (The visions of Obdulio chasing a mimelike apparition through the streets play like an outtake from ''Juliet of the Spirits'' as staged by the ''Waiting for Guffman'' auteur Corky St. Clair.)</p>
        <p>It sounds churlish to bash a film that's as bereft of bad thoughts as a tiny puppy. But when the puppy licks your face for 108 minutes, enough's enough.</p>

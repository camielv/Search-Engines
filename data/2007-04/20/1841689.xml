        <p>Commuters in suburban Pretoria set two train cars on fire after losing patience with efforts to repair a fault that had stopped traffic on the train's line, the commuter authority Metrorail said. The train had been stopped by a red signal at the Greenview station, but when technicians arrived to make repairs, some furious commuters threw stones at them, injuring two repairmen and three commuters. ''Others set the carriages on fire,'' the authority's spokesman, Thokozani Zitha, told the SAPA news service. ''We were able to save a third carriage.''</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Representative John T. Doolittle relinquished his seat on the powerful Appropriations Committee Thursday amid signs that federal investigators were stepping up several linked investigations into corruption on the panel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doolittle, a California Republican, is linked to three inquiries on accusations that Appropriations Committee members accepted bribes or campaign contributions in exchange for earmarking federal money to certain projects.</p>
        <p>Former Representative Randy Cunningham, another California Republican who had been on the committee, is in prison for inserting earmarks in exchange for money. Representative Jerry Lewis, the California Republican who headed the panel until this session, is under investigation as well. Mr. Lewis has said he did nothing wrong.</p>
        <p>The first issue involving Mr. Doolittle centers on the role of his wife, Julie, as a commissioned fund-raiser for him. The arrangement meant that the Doolittles kept a part of the contributions given to Mr. Doolittle's campaign committees, blurring the distinction between personal payments and campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doolittle is also under investigation in connection with Jack Abramoff, whose lobbying firm, Washington restaurant and personal charity group paid Mrs. Doolittle as an event planner. Mr. Abramoff is in prison on a bribery conviction. Finally, Mr. Doolittle is under scrutiny for his ties to Brent Wilkes, a San Diego military contractor who was recently indicted on bribery charges. Mr. Wilkes arranged tens of thousands in campaign contributions for Mr. Doolittle while he was shepherding through Congress $37 million in spending items for a company Mr. Wilkes controlled. (Mr. Wilkes also raised money for Mr. Lewis.)</p>
        <p>Federal prosecutors are investigating the possibilities that Mr. Doolittle may have traded earmarks or other official acts for illegal payments from Mr. Abramoff or Mr. Wilkes. Both the Abramoff and Cunningham investigations have recently shown signs of quickening. In February, prosecutors indicted both Mr. Wilkes and a former Central Intelligence Agency executive director, Kyle Foggo, who was charged with playing a role in Mr. Wilkes's schemes.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, federal investigators searched the Doolittles' Virginia home for records of Mrs. Doolittle's fund-raising and event-planning business. On the same day, Kevin Ring, a former aide to Mr. Doolittle who left to work as a lobbyist with Mr. Abramoff, resigned from his job at a law firm in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doolittle said in a statement: ''I understand how the most recent circumstances may lead some to question my tenure on the Appropriations Committee.''</p>
        <p>House Republican leaders pressed Mr. Doolittle to step aside. ''I commend him for having the courage to do the right thing,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the minority leader.</p>

        <p>Rome's ancient past is about to get a modern-day shake-up through a reorganization of existing and new museums that will sprawl through the historic center, the city's mayor said. ''It's as though we were creating a new Louvre,'' Walter Veltroni, the mayor of Rome, told reporters after the project was approved by City Hall on Wednesday. With the Capitoline Museums at its core, a new cultural park nicknamed the Grande Campidoglio, or Great Capitol, will include several new exhibition spaces. Among them are the Museum of the Imperial Forums, which is to open in October inside the recently refurbished Trajan's Markets. The museum will exhibit artifacts found during recent digs in the Forums. In coming months, a municipal building next to the Circus Maximus is to be emptied of civil servants to make room for the Great Museum of Roman History. It will house the Museum of Roman Civilization, currently in an out-of-the-way Roman suburb, as well as the new multimedia Museum of the Ancient City of Rome. ''The idea is to increase the archaeological and cultural offerings of the city,'' Mr. Veltroni said.</p>

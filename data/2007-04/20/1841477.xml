        <p>BAILLIEUL--Geneva J. Southwick teacher, artist and amateur musician, known for her work in the community of Southwick, Massachusetts, died on April 14 at Avery Manor in Needham MA, after a long illness. She was 90. Geneva Jeanette Gillam was born in Boise Idaho and raised on a ranch where she developed a love of gardening and music and learned to manage farm animals and handle a rifle. She attended Boise public schools then Albion State Normal School. In 1943, she married Paul Baillieul, who was serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps in Boise. After the war they returned to Paul's home in Springfield, MA, and, in 1948, moved to Southwick, MA. She was a teacher for many years in the Southwick school system, retiring in June, 1983. Together with her husband, Paul, she was one of the founders of the Southwick Historical Society, and she also helped found Southwick's first Art League. She hosted many musical evenings for friends who performed or enjoyed chamber music. After retirement, Geneva began new careers of artist and art teacher. Her painting entitled ''A Farm Family'' won Best of Show in the 1981 National Grange art and photography contest held in Spokane, Washington. Geneva Baillieul received many honors and accolades for her art, and she was widely recognized for her service to others. In the early 1990's she received the Hidden Heroine Award from the Southwick Girl Scouts, and the Southwick Selectmen conferred upon her a Lifetime Achievement Award. Mrs. Baillieul is survived by her two sons, John Baillieul and his wife Patricia of Needham, Massachusetts, and Thomas and his wife Deborah of Columbus Ohio, and by five grandchildren, Emily and her husband Jonah Sacks of Somerville, Massachusetts, and Charlotte and John Paul of Needham, Benjamin and Alexander, and his wife Rachel Tayse-Baillieul of Columbus, Ohio and their daughter (Geneva's greatgranddaughter), Lillian Elizabeth Baillieul.</p>

        <p>BLAU--Henrietta. Born August 4, 1915, in Brooklyn, NY. Henrietta died peacefully on April 17, 2007 after a brief hospital stay. She was predeceased by her beloved twin sister Hortense Millendorf of Philadelphia, and is survived by her niece Carole Fiore of Tallahassee, FL, her nephew David Millendorf of Spring Hill, FL, and countless friends and admirers. Hers was the epitome of a well-lived life. She loved her family, was a loyal friend, gracious host, generous benefactor of many charitable organizations, successful businesswoman, and pet lover extraordinaire. Most importantly, she enjoyed each one of those roles and got tremendous pleasure out of life. Services scheduled for 11:30am on Sunday April 22 at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 91st Street and Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, contributions in her memory to UJA-Federation and Guiding Eyes for the Blind would be appreciated.</p>

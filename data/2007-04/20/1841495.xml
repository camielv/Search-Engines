        <p>POPE--Leavitt J. His footsteps engraved upon the sands of time bore an incredible legacy of caring. Legions of this Town's endangered youth drew his attention. He rolled up his sleeves and lent his immense energies to the task of rebuilding young lives. Crashaw wrote: ''All thy good works which went before...weave a constellation of crowns!'' In our world of ransomed youth, he stood so very tall as a Governor of Daytop over a quarter century. We mourn our loss and offer prayerful support to his beloved wife and children! (Msgr.) William B. O'Brien President, Daytop Village</p>

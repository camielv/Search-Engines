        <p>With his attorney general under fire in Washington and his fight with Congressional Democrats over paying for the war at a stalemate, President Bush came here Wednesday before a friendly audience to give his thinking on Iraq, Congress and the massacre at Virginia Polytechnic Institute.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a 90-minute, town-hall-style meeting in a high school gymnasium, Mr. Bush said he would not buckle to polls showing opinion cutting against him on a variety of issues, and conveyed his belief that he would be vindicated by history.</p>
        <p>''Let me put it to you this way,'' Mr. Bush said. ''When it's all said and done, when Laura and I head back home -- which at this moment will be Crawford, Tex. -- I will get there and look in the mirror, and I will say, 'I came with a set of principles and I didn't try to change my principles to make me popular.' ''</p>
        <p>He was responding to a question from an audience member who had said he admired the president's ''stay-to-itiveness,'' but wondered ''when you go to bed at night, and you see these polls -- everybody and their brother does a poll now -- how does it make you feel?''</p>
        <p>It is a question that Mr. Bush has shown impatience with at news conferences. But, he told his questioner politely, ''I've been in politics long enough to know that polls just go poof at times.''</p>
        <p>Many of the questions posed to Mr. Bush were prefaced with comments like ''this is truly an honor.'' And the event took place in a town that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Bush in 2004 and is represented by John A. Boehner, the minority leader in the House of Representatives, who accompanied Mr. Bush here aboard Air Force One.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush began his remarks with a story about how the White House concierge asked him, on the day before his first inauguration, what kind of rug he wanted for the Oval Office and, enlisting the help of his wife, he said, ''Make sure the rug says, 'Optimistic person comes to work.' ''</p>
        <p>Later, discussing his optimism that the United States will succeed in Iraq, he said, ''Remember the rug?''</p>
        <p>And he concluded with a thought about what historians would say about him. Last year, he said, he read three biographies of George Washington. ''If they're still writing about 1,'' he said, ''43 doesn't have to worry about it.''</p>

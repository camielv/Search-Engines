        <p>Two miners were trapped under 45 to 100 feet of rock and dirt near Barton, Md., on Tuesday after a side of an open pit coal mine collapsed, and rescue efforts continued yesterday with workers filling 20 to 30 trucks an hour.</p>

        <p>Two miners were trapped under 45 to 100 feet of rock and dirt near Barton, Md., on Tuesday after a side of an open pit coal mine collapsed, and rescue efforts continued yesterday with workers filling 20 to 30 trucks an hour.</p>
        <p>Federal mine safety officials said the two men, whom they would not identify, were driving a bulldozer and a shovel in the No. 3 mine of Tri-Star Mining Inc. about 10:15 a.m. when a 125-foot-high side of the mine collapsed.</p>
        <p>Federal officials happened to be at the site for a regular inspection in a nearby pit when the collapse occurred, but they did not see what happened.</p>
        <p>Since then, a huge mining shovel, with a bucket that hauls 50 tons at a time, has filled truck after truck, around the clock.</p>
        <p>But to make the site safe for the rescue workers, explosives had to be used yesterday morning to bring down part of the unstable wall of the pit, slowing the rescue efforts. By yesterday, officials estimated, about half the collapsed material had been removed.</p>
        <p>''We are not giving up hope, and we're continuing to run it as a rescue operation,'' said Bob Cornett, acting district manager for the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. ''We've seen large rocks in the area that potentially could create voids of oxygen.''</p>
        <p>In addition, both the shovel and the bulldozer have enclosed cabs that may have kept the miners safe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cornett said it was not yet clear what caused the collapse, but the recent heavy rains and the freeze-thaw cycles may have been a factor.</p>
        <p>''But whether it was a direct cause, I don't know, and we won't know until we investigate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mine agency records show that Tri-Star, a privately owned company, has owned and operated the mine, in far western Maryland, since 1986. There have been 10 injuries and no deaths at the mine since 1995. It has been cited for 60 violations and a total of $3,688 in fines since 1995.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman at Tri-Star's office in Barton, who would not give her name, said it had been a difficult two days.</p>
        <p>''For the families of the men, it's hard just waiting,'' she said.</p>

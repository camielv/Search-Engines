        <p>The police in Northern California were searching on Thursday for a man who they said told his family and a local pastor that he planned an attack that would ''make Virginia Tech look mild.'' Several schools were closed for the day and students were sent home as a precaution.</p>
        <p>Jim Denney, the sheriff of Sutter County, north of Sacramento, issued a bulletin late Wednesday night, alerting the police to threats made by the man, Jeffrey T. Carney. The bulletin said Mr. Carney, 28, might be armed with an automatic rifle, hand-made explosive devices and poison. The warning said that he was thought to be homeless and addicted to methamphetamine, and that he had called his pastor on Wednesday saying he planned an attack and wanted the police to shoot and kill him.</p>

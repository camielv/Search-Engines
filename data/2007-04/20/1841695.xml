        <p>The police last night released the name of a man suspected in the rape of a 23-year-old Columbia University graduate student over the weekend. The man, left, was identified as William Roberts, 30, and a police photo of him was posted on fliers on the Columbia campus, and sent in e-mail messages to students, teachers and staff members. Mr. Roberts was identified through investigative work and tips, the police said. They would not say if he had a criminal record, but The Associated Press reported that he had convictions for attempted murder and assault. On Saturday, the student was forced into her Hamilton Heights apartment by a man who had followed her from the elevator of her building, according to the police. He raped and assaulted her for the next 19 hours, and before leaving, tied her to a piece of furniture and set a fire, the police said. She managed to escape. The police ask anyone with information to call 1-800-577-TIPS (1-800-577-8477).</p>

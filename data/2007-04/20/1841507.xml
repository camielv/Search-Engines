        <p>Fans of this Dublin band salivated when word got out about its latest album, ''The Cost'' (Anti-). The news was simply that the album had been recorded live in the studio, but as anyone who has seen the Frames in concert knows, that is a very good thing. Stars at home in Ireland but cult favorites in America, they play a spare and intense variant of folk-rock, with guitar, piano and fiddle rising again and again from tranquillity to raw, cathartic peaks. U2 and Neil Young are reference points for the Frames, who have been together for 17 years, but modal Celtic melodies also echo powerfully in their music. On ''The Cost,'' as Glen Hansard, above center, sings in a disarmingly vulnerable voice about hearts that seem set to smolder forever, guitar and fiddle trade parts and heat up together. The album's title song, about giving yourself to a passion that may be destructive (''Will we let it burn/Burn us down?'' Mr. Hansard asks, though the answer seems clear), contains the biggest climax, with a blistering fiddle part by Colm Mac Con Iomaire, left, that cries as loudly and as ardently as any rock guitar solo. It should be wonderful live. (Tuesday at 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, 212-307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $25.)</p>

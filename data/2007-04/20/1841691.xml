        <p>As Nagasaki struggled to make sense of the shooting death of its mayor, Itcho Ito, his son-in-law announced that he would run in Mr. Ito's place in the mayoral election on Sunday. Mr. Ito was campaigning for a fourth term when he was gunned down Tuesday. The police said he was killed by a member of an organized crime group but have yet to figure out a motive. Residents placed flowers on the sidewalk where Mr. Ito was shot, while his family held a private funeral. Later, the son-in-law, Makoto Yokoo, a 40-year-old journalist with no experience in politics, announced his candidacy.</p>

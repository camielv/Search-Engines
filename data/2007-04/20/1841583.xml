        <p>In the days before a Queens man killed his mother, her companion, a home health aide and himself in an eruption of gunfire on Wednesday morning, his mother had made desperate attempts to have her son forcibly removed from their home, her fears of being attacked only worsened by her anger that the police were not aggressively intervening in a family nightmare, said people who knew her.</p>
        <p>The mother, Sonia Taylor, 44, who was killed when her 20-year-old son, Wade Jimmy Lee Dawkins, shot her in her face, had even gone to Queens County Court the day before, hoping to secure an order of protection against him. The visit was described yesterday by a co-worker, who said she had driven Ms. Taylor to the courthouse on Tuesday after the two women had completed their 11 p.m.-7 a.m. nursing shifts at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan.</p>

        <p>In the days before a Queens man killed his mother, her companion, a home health aide and himself in an eruption of gunfire on Wednesday morning, his mother had made desperate attempts to have her son forcibly removed from their home, her fears of being attacked only worsened by her anger that the police were not aggressively intervening in a family nightmare, said people who knew her.</p>
        <p>The mother, Sonia Taylor, 44, who was killed when her 20-year-old son, Wade Jimmy Lee Dawkins, shot her in her face, had even gone to Queens County Court the day before, hoping to secure an order of protection against him. The visit was described yesterday by a co-worker, who said she had driven Ms. Taylor to the courthouse on Tuesday after the two women had completed their 11 p.m.-7 a.m. nursing shifts at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''She said he was threatening her and she could not get him committed,'' said the co-worker, Venice Bell-Nelson. Ms. Bell-Nelson said Ms. Taylor had phoned the police Internal Affairs Division on Monday night before leaving for work, and was advised by an officer there that she could seek an order of protection.</p>
        <p>Whether Ms. Taylor had received or even applied for such protection was unclear yesterday.</p>
        <p>Officials were unable to determine yesterday whether an application had been made by Ms. Taylor because the family court offices had closed for the day.</p>
        <p>''She always has been calling the police,'' said Ann Taylor, Ms. Taylor's sister. ''The boy was violent and suffering from a mental disorder. The police were very reluctant to do anything.''</p>
        <p>The shootings took place shortly after 11:40 a.m. on Wednesday in a small home on 225th Street in Cambria Heights. The police said Mr. Dawkins opened fire only 10 minutes after Ms. Taylor had insisted to a 911 officer that ''something terrible would happen'' if officers were not quickly dispatched to the house.</p>
        <p>Ms. Taylor and the home health aide, Syndi Boye, 28, were fatally shot, as was Ms. Taylor's companion, Arnold Lawson, 47. Mr. Taylor's nephew, Maurice Johnson, 21, hid in a closet after being shot in the leg, then climbed out a window and fled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dawkins then shot himself in the head, according to the police.</p>
        <p>Chief Michael Collins, a police spokesman, said a review of department records showed that officers had visited the home six times since last May in response to calls from Ms. Taylor.</p>
        <p>Officers did take Mr. Dawkins to Long Island Jewish Medical Center on Oct. 25 after he threw things around the house. He remained hospitalized for several days before returning, Chief Collins said yesterday.</p>
        <p>But until Wednesday, he said, the phone calls from Ms. Taylor, and visits by officers, did not provide enough evidence to arrest or forcibly remove Mr. Dawkins.</p>
        <p>''I don't think any of these instances involved a report of someone being violent. It was more like disorderly stuff, taking things,'' Chief Collins said.</p>

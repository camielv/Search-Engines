        <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Greek and Roman galleries reopen to the public today. The space, used for the last half-century as a dining area, has been redesigned and expanded to 57,000 square feet, enabling the Met to restore thousands of ancient artifacts to public view.</p>
        <p>The heart of the $220 million, 15-year project is a two-story peristyle court, left, lined with columns, populated with statuary and with a pool and fountain in its center.</p>
        <p>The galleries display treasures ranging from frescoes to intricately carved sarcophagi to monumental busts to a bronze chariot.</p>
        <p>Western antiquity from the Bronze Age through the reign of Constantine unfolds in logical, stately order, as was intended from the museum's early days, Michael Kimmelman writes [Review, Page E25].</p>
        <p>A huge array of objects has been exhumed from storage and animated by new touch-screen computers -- and by air and sun -- in the vast, skylighted new space.</p>
        <p>A graphic guide to the new galleries, with a selection of highlights from the collection, is on Page E31.</p>

        <p>Kevin Wirth was hunting fish with his eyes. He stared into the water of Clarks Hill Lake and did not seem to notice the long ash from a cigarette burning under his nose.</p>
        <p>Just in time, Wirth flicked the ash into the water before it fell to the deck of his boat. He was waiting silently over a light green spot in the shallows of the lake; a three-pound bass, which had darted away, was back to its nest.</p>
        <p>His feel for the fish and their habits has made Wirth successful in the Bassmasters Elite Series. He had a similar feel as a jockey almost 26 years ago when he rode in the 1981 Kentucky Derby at 18.</p>
        <p>An accident during a race not long afterward ruined his career as a jockey, but Wirth again feels connected to animals. This time it is a connection with a fishing rod, not tack.</p>
        <p>It was midmorning Wednesday and Wirth, 44, had been on the lake in his bass boat since early Monday practicing for a Bassmaster Elite Series event, which started Thursday with a first prize of $100,000.</p>
        <p>In practicing, he will flip a line into the water to judge the reaction to different baits, but he will shake off fish, instead of catching them. For Wirth, practice is more about scouting than fishing.</p>
        <p>''Which way are they going?'' Wirth said to himself as he gazed into the water. ''Are they going in, are they going out?''</p>
        <p>He turned and said, ''You have to be on the right side of the fish.''</p>
        <p>Wirth will keep his cellphone turned off during practice because he makes mental notes and does not want to be bothered, even if it is a call from home. If it is an emergency, Wirth can be found, but he does not want a lot of clutter in his head from telephone calls and messages.</p>
        <p>Wirth is happy to show off his skill, though. A one-and-a-half-pound bass skirted by, and Wirth said: ''You want me to catch him? It will take two seconds.''</p>
        <p>It actually took 57 seconds. Wirth snapped the fish out of the water, extracted the hook and flipped the fish back in the water.</p>
        <p>''I've gone out fishing with him, and he wears me out,'' said Herson Sanchez, a jockey agent in Tampa, Fla., and the best man at Wirth's wedding. ''I've known him 25 years, and when he first decided to go fishing, well, I wasn't surprised that he got on the map.''</p>
        <p>Wirth's intensity does not keep away other anglers. Aaron Martens spun out of the mainstream of the lake to pull alongside Wirth to commiserate about the lack of activity in the water during Wednesday's practice.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, Kelly Jordon pulled up on the other side of Wirth's boat.</p>
        <p>They shared the challenges of the lake -- spooky fish, varying water temperatures -- and then they shared Wirth's nicknames.</p>
        <p>''We call him L.B.L., for Little Black Lung,'' Jordon said. ''We're going to jump on this boat one day, all of us, and take those cigarettes.''</p>
        <p>Wirth, who is also nicknamed Slim, said, ''Tournament or no tournament, I'll take this boat straight to the dock and get some more.''</p>
        <p>The 5-foot-10 Wirth is not as slim as he was in May 1981, when he weighed a little more than 100 pounds and saddled Mythical Ruler in the Kentucky Derby. Inexperienced and facing jockeys like Bill Shoemaker, Laffit Pincay Jr. and Angel Cordero Jr., he rode a modest horse too wide and finished 17th among 21 horses.</p>
        <p>Wirth, a native of Louisville, Ky., was certain that he had a long career ahead of him as a jockey. His father, Fred, was a top-shelf thoroughbred trainer in Kentucky and Ocala, Fla., and Kevin Wirth had a pipeline to fine horses.</p>
        <p>But early the next spring, his career path changed. In the thick, early spring loam of Suffolk Downs in Boston, Wirth's horse suddenly stopped at the wire and Wirth was catapulted over the horse.</p>
        <p>Wirth escaped serious injury, but the bones in his back were damaged enough that doctors warned that another bad fall could put him in a wheelchair.</p>
        <p>''Emotionally, it took a long time to get over,'' Wirth said. ''I hung around the house, galloped some, but I couldn't race, and that was hard on me.''</p>
        <p>Wirth stayed connected to racing by becoming an equine dentist. His skill and family connections sprouted a business that in eight years was giving him a six-figure income. Wirth said that if he maintained the business, he would be making $250,000 to $400,000 a year.</p>
        <p>But it seemed too much like work, so he started fishing full time in 1989. Since then, he has had one victory, five second-place finishes and 25 top-10 finishes on the Bassmaster circuit. He has qualified eight times for the Bassmaster Classic -- the Kentucky Derby of fishing -- and finished sixth in February in Birmingham, Ala.</p>
        <p>Wirth has earned about $650,000 on the circuit, and that does not include money from his sponsor, Early Times. These days, he is connected to the Derby because the official drink for the race is the Early Times Mint Julep.</p>
        <p>Wirth, who lives in Crestwood, Ky., is now more recognized in Louisville for his fishing.</p>
        <p>Last June, he was asked to throw out the first pitch at a Louisville Bats minor league baseball game -- using a fishing rod with an 80-pound braided line threaded to a baseball as his arm.</p>
        <p>''They asked me if I wanted to practice, and I said I do this for a living, no practice,'' Wirth said.</p>
        <p>The angler/pitcher got the ball over the plate with his first cast/pitch, as promised.</p>
        <p>It is no accident that Wirth is so self-assured. He went bowling with some other anglers and rolled a 196. He plays golf occasionally, has a handicap of 2 and said that he might even try the Champions Tour, which he can do when he turns 50.</p>
        <p>''Being the youngest of four boys, you better have something extra, they gang up on you,'' Wirth said. ''So you better learn to help yourself and work hard.''</p>

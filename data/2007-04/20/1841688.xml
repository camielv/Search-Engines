        <p>Zimbabwe plans to redraw its political subdivisions in its major cities, Harare and Bulawayo, before elections next March, the minister for local government was quoted as saying in the government-controlled newspaper The Herald. The redrawn districts would include more rural voters in formerly urban legislative districts, a change that is likely to dilute the votes of opposition supporters who are concentrated in major cities. The government also has plans to set legislative elections for 2008, coinciding with the presidential vote. Outside political analysts say the changes will increase the re-election prospects of President Robert G. Mugabe, who has been the head of government since 1980.</p>

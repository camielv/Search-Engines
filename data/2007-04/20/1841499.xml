        <p>SAUNDERS--Donald G., of San Juan Capistrano, California, passed away peacefully at his home on April 13, 2007. Born in Cleveland, Ohio on October 25, 1931, Mr. Saunders was a private investor and entrepreneur. Known as the ''Grandfather'' of resort timesharing, he is widely credited with introducing this industry into the U.S. in the early 1970s. Mr. Saunders distinguished himself by his colorful personal style and his careful insight into the personalities of others. In addition to his experience in the timesharing industry, he was a founder, officer, and major shareholder of several private and public companies in other industries. Regarded throughout his life for his considerable physical strength and stature, these attributes were exceeded by his natural charm and warm charisma. He is survived by his wife, Bonnie; five children, Scott, Justin, Courtney, Corbin, and Michelle; a sister, Lois Worth Sosna; and two granddaughters. A private memorial service was held in Corona del Mar, California on Tuesday, April 17, 2007.</p>

        <p>Cannes Festival Films Named</p>
        <p>Quentin Tarantino, Joel and Ethan Coen, David Fincher, James Gray and Gus Van Sant will represent the United States in the quest for the Palme d'Or at the 60th Cannes Film Festival next month, Agence France-Presse reported. Other familiar names among directors of the 22 films in competition include Wong Kar Wai of Hong Kong, Emir Kusturica of Serbia and Bela Tarr of Hungary. New filmmakers will be represented, too. ''For the anniversary, we chose to mix heritage with modernity, well-known names with new blood,'' Giles Jacob, left, the president of the festival, told a news conference in Paris. Mr. Wong, who was the president of the jury last year, will open this year's event with ''My Blueberry Nights,'' an English-language road-trip movie starring Norah Jones. Mr. Tarantino will show ''Death Proof'' from ''Grindhouse''; the Coens, ''No Country for Old Men''; Mr. Fincher, ''Zodiac''; Mr. Gray, ''We Own the Night''; and Mr. Van Sant, ''Paranoid Park.'' Michael Moore, who won the Palme d'Or in 2004 for his documentary ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' will be represented by ''Sicko,'' about health care in the United States, which will be shown out of competition. The festival runs from May 16 through May 27.</p>
        <p>R.S.C. Raises Millions For Stratford Overhaul</p>
        <p>The Royal Shakespeare Company announced yesterday that it had raised more than $200 million to redevelop its theaters in Stratford-on-Avon, England. The plan, approved by the Stratford District Council but needing further government approval before construction can begin, includes a new 1,000-seat main theater that will move the audience closer to the stage, as well as a rooftop restaurant with views over the town. The work is scheduled to be completed in 2010.</p>
        <p>Chris Rock Prepares</p>
        <p>In preparation for a national tour this fall, Chris Rock, below, has been showing up unannounced at New York comedy clubs and doing long sets of new material. On Wednesday night at Stand-Up New York, he performed for more than an hour, riffing on a range of topics that included Jackie Robinson, Don Imus, the differences between a job and a career, and what it's like to be one of the few black people living in an affluent area of New Jersey. He opened with some remarks about the Virginia Tech shootings but quickly abandoned that material, acknowledging to the audience, ''There's nothing funny about this, is there?''</p>
        <p>Free Philharmonic Concert</p>
        <p>The New York Philharmonic's annual free Memorial Day concert at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine will be at 8 p.m. on May 28. Xian Zhang, left, associate conductor, will lead the orchestra in Dvorak's ''Carnival Overture'' and Brahms's Symphony No. 1. Seating is on a first-come, first-served basis; because attendance will be limited as a result of restoration work, a 15-by-20-foot screen with a live audio and video feed will be erected in Synod Hall on the cathedral campus when the cathedral is full. Weather permitting, music will also be piped onto the adjacent Pulpit Green.</p>
        <p>Footnote</p>
        <p>The Kimbell Art Museum of Fort Worth placed a winning bid of $5.7 million at Christie's yesterday to buy back the 1841 J. M. W. Turner painting ''Glaucus and Scylla.'' Last year, the museum returned the painting to the heirs of John and Anna Jaff√© after an investigation concluded that it had been unlawfully seized in 1943 by the pro-Nazi regime in France.</p>

        <p>RAEBURN--Robert A., 77, former president N. S. Meyer, Inc., died April 17, 2007, at NY Presbyterian Hospital following a long battle with cancer. Mr. Raeburn graduated from the Virginia Military Institute. He distinguished himself as a member of the Institute's swim team, setting southern conference records. He was a very active supporter of the Regiment of Graduates, serving as class agent for the class of 1951 until this past year. Following the sale of N. S. Meyer, Inc. in 2000, Mr. Raeburn donated to the Virginia Military Institute Museum his entire collection of original Civil War Paintings including the well known ''Drummer Boy''. Mr. Raeburn was a member of the Board of Trustees of the NY Military Academy. He was a great supporter of the ''Puppies Behind Bars''. Mr. Raeburn was predeceased by his first wife, Joann, who passed away in 1992. He is survived by his widow Donna, a daughter, Victoria Benton (Leigh), a son Robert (Karen), four grandchildren, Christopher, P.J., Kyle, and Lauren, and three great - grandsons. Friends may call Friday, April 20th, 25 and 7-9 pm with the service at Frank E. Campbell, Saturday, 11:30 am. Interment private.

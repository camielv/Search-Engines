        <p>The Greek and Roman galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, measuring 57,000 square feet, are the culmination of a 15-year, $220 million effort.</p>
        <p>1926 -- Meant to evoke a setting from classical antiquity, a skylighted atrium (left) houses mainly Roman art.</p>
        <p>1954 -- The atrium becomes a restaurant (left). Major classical holdings are removed from display.</p>
        <p>Highlights of the Galleries</p>
        <p>1. Column, Temple of Artemis at Sardis  Greek, 300 B.C.  Stands about 12 feet tall in the museum but was originally more than 58 feet tall. Its vegetal pattern is exceptionally elaborate.</p>
        <p>2. Veiled and Masked Dancer  Greek, third-second century B.C.  Layers of clothing sheathe a professional dancer, an entertainer common in ancient Alexandria.</p>
        <p>3. Frescoes From a Bedroom at Boscoreale  Roman 40-50 B.C. Frescoes creating the illusion of receding space decorated a bedroom in a Roman villa near Pompeii.</p>
        <p>4. Garland Bowl  Roman, late first century B.C.  Four separate slices of glass were joined together, and a thin glass garland was affixed to each quadrant.</p>
        <p>5. Chariot  Etruscan, sixth century B.C.  Probably a parade chariot. Its panels depict episodes from the life of Achilles.</p>
        <p>6. Emperor Constantine I  Roman, A.D. 325-370  The long face and neat hairstyle of this portrait of the first Christian emperor are meant to evoke earlier, effective emperors.</p>
        <p>7. Support for a Water Basin (Porphyry)  Roman, Second century A.D.  Porphyry was highly regarded as a stone because of its association with royalty and authority.</p>
        <p>8. Sarcophagus With the Triumph of Dionysus and the Four Seasons (Badminton Sarcophagus)  Roman, A.D. 260-270 In a celebration of pleasure, Dionysus, god of wine, is depicted at the center, riding a panther, with Pan, the goat god, nearby. On the left are figures for winter and spring, on the right, summer and fall.</p>
        <p>9. Emperor Trebonianus Gallus  Roman, A.D. 251-253  One of a small number of nearly complete bronze statues from the third century. The cropped hair and beard were favored by soldier emperors of the age.</p>
        <p>10. Youthful Hercules  Roman, A.D. 69-98  Young Hercules, with a lion skin draped over his arm, probably once decorated a public bath.</p>
        <p>11. Dionysus Leaning on the Figure of Spes (Hope)  Roman, 27 B.C.-A.D. 68  Dionysus stands with a female figure, which may have been added to support the outstretched arm.</p>

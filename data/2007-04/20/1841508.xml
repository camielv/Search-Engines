        <p>Months before a show goes up, the news releases arrive, peppering journalists' in-boxes like the vanguard of an advancing army. And there are the photographs and fliers sent out to give an idea of what the choreographer will create -- even if the choreographer has yet to settle on a firm idea, or any idea. Making and marketing have competing needs. Enter Tere O'Connor and the Nothing Festival, which features eight works that deal with things like  well, your guess is as good as mine. Frustrated by the external demands placed on artists, Mr. O'Connor has fashioned an event free of advance hype. The choreographers don't have to worry about tethering themselves to any half-baked ideas, and the only preconceived notion viewers have to overcome is the festival's lame title. Never mind, the artists chosen by Mr. O'Connor more than make up for it: the first week of performances, which conclude tonight and tomorrow night, includes Douglas Dunn, Hijack, Sam Kim and Dean Moss. The second week, running Tuesday through April 28, brings Luciana Achugar, Walter Dundervill, Jon Kinzel and Susan Rethorst. (Jeanine Durning, above left, and Anneke Hansen in a work by Ms. Rethorst). From Ms. Achugar's hot and heady ideas about performance to Mr. Dunn's enigmatic, quirky formalism, there should be something, in this Nothing, for everyone. (7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-924-0077, dtw.org; $20; $12 for students and 65+.)</p>

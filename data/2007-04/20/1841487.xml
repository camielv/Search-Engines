He was a 1941 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and was a Golden Gloves boxer during his years at Annapolis. During World War II he served on the USS Perkins based at Pearl Harbor and as Lieutenant Commander on the submarine USS Cobia. He worked for Bloomsburg Mills Inc. from 1947 until 1992, serving as Chairman and CEO. He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Virginia Weber Marion of New Caanan; four children; Leslie M.

        <p>Philadelphia still has hopes for the postseason, but after the feeblest start in the major leagues, the Phillies are struggling simply to remain in contention through prom season.</p>
        <p>And, fairly or unfairly, it is Manager Charlie Manuel's chest at which many fingers are being pointed. With each defeat, and there have been 10 in 14 games, speculation mounts that he could be the first manager fired this season. So far, the congenial Manuel has lost nothing more severe than his temper, in a confrontation with a Philadelphia radio personality.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, 44-year-old Jamie Moyer carried a two-hit shutout into the ninth inning for the Phillies, before he lost his command and closer Tom Gordon momentarily lost his control. A comfortable four-run lead deflated into a wobbly 4-2 win over Washington, but at this point Philadelphia needs victories to be plentiful more than sturdy.</p>
        <p>''Had 'em all the way,'' Manuel, 63, said with a whistling-past-the-graveyard smile.</p>
        <p>Even the good news carried an asterisk. The Phillies played without an injured Ryan Howard, the National League's most valuable player last year. Howard sprained a ligament below his left knee Wednesday when he lunged for the first-base bag while he hit into a double play. He is expected back in the lineup in a day or two. Less certain is when his absent home run swing (one in 47 at-bats) will return.</p>
        <p>The staff's ace, Brett Myers, has been sent to the bullpen, such is Philadelphia's urgent need for a reliable setup man. Only later will it be known whether this was an act of inspiration or desperation.</p>
        <p>Manuel has received a vote of confidence from General Manager Pat Gillick, but in Philadelphia, a vote of confidence is not always different from a last cigarette.</p>
        <p>Yet it is not Gillick's habit to fire managers in midseason. The players have to accept responsibility, he said Thursday, especially for becoming impatient at the plate with runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>''He can't go up there and hit for them,'' Gillick said of Manuel.</p>
        <p>Gillick has also been on the receiving end of scattershot criticism. Fans and some reporters have blamed him for not sufficiently shoring up what has so far been a leaky bullpen.</p>
        <p>Last November, the Phillies retreated from signing the free-agent reliever Joe Borowski, who saved 36 games in 2006 for the Florida Marlins but who gave Philadelphia doubts after failing a physical examination of his throwing shoulder. Cleveland took a chance on him instead, and although he gave up six runs to the Yankees on Thursday and blew the game, Borowski has five saves -- one more than the Phillies have victories.</p>
        <p>''We thought we had that area covered,'' said Gillick, whose team is six games behind the first-place Mets. ''Medically, when the guy didn't pass, it opened up another hole.''</p>
        <p>And so the Phillies -- the franchise with the most losses in team sports, according to the Elias Sports Bureau -- slouch toward a landmark of futility, their 10,000th defeat. Naturally, a Web site (celebrate10000.com) has been created to memorialize the occasion, which will arrive with a mere 34 more losses.</p>
        <p>The Web site is meant to celebrate the perseverance of Philadelphia's long-suffering fans, according to its founder, Charley DeBow. No city with teams in the four major professional sports has gone longer -- 24 years -- without a championship, since the 76ers hoisted the N.B.A. trophy in 1983. The Phillies' lone World Series title came in 1980, and the club has reached the playoffs only twice since.</p>
        <p>''Let's continue to let our players know that we demand hard work, loyalty and dedication,'' DeBow wrote on the Web site. ''If you take a day off and lollygag, we will boo you. If you make a fundamental mistake, we will boo you. If you think you better then us, we will boo you. But if you care, if you really care, and you embrace us as phans, then we will give you something far better then a ring. We will give you love.''</p>
        <p>Succinctly, if not always grammatically, DeBow described the player-fan covenant in Philadelphia. Indirectly, his writing also helps to explain why Manuel is not nearly as popular with many Phillies fans as he is with his players.</p>
        <p>Players say they appreciate Manuel's honesty, accessibility and ebullience.</p>
        <p>''Whether you're scuffling or going good, he's the same,'' center fielder Aaron Rowand said. ''He believes in everybody. He's definitely not the reason we are where we're at right now.''</p>
        <p>Yet, when Manuel was hired three years ago, many Phillies fans preferred Jim Leyland, now manager of the Detroit Tigers. Some complain that Manuel's American League experience in Cleveland has left him scrambling to master the double-switch, bunt-the-runner-over intricacies of the National League.</p>
        <p>His third season with the Phillies has opened squeamishly like the previous two -- besieged Aprils that were followed by tantalizing late-season surges that fell short of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia fans here described Manuel as a nice guy -- maybe too nice -- for a dyspeptic sporting audience that prefers a fiery manager like Larry Bowa, someone who will throw a tantrum instead of a bouquet of compliments.</p>
        <p>''The players like him -- that's not good,'' Mark Such, 43, of Warminster, Pa., said of Manuel. ''We need someone like Bowa to be tougher on them.''</p>
        <p>After an 8-1 defeat to the Mets in Philadelphia on Tuesday, a question about why Manuel did not react more angrily toward his players later erupted into a shouting confrontation between him and the radio talk show host Howard Eskin.</p>
        <p>Manuel, who is from Virginia and has the Blue Ridge Mountains in his voice, feels he has been unfairly portrayed as a rube by Eskin, called Elmer Befuddled and Grandpa Charlie merely because of his Southern accent.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Manuel said he regretted that his response ''wasn't classy.'' But Rowand said that Manuel's outburst had resulted from three years of Eskin's ''calling Charlie an idiot, a moron, a hillbilly.''</p>
        <p>''Everybody has a breaking point,'' Rowand said.</p>
        <p>Eskin has said he was simply asking tough questions. There was a time to scream at players, Manuel conceded, but also a time to back off, to let them play.</p>
        <p>''I'm in the mode for them to go out and be aggressive and start hitting the ball and having fun and letting it happen,'' Manuel said. ''We need a kick-start. We need a big game.''</p>
        <p>To clear his head, he spends time on his hobby -- coin collecting. ''I'm a big silver guy,'' Manuel said, predicting that the price of silver will soon rise exorbitantly. ''I think eventually people will be melting their spoons and cups and glasses.''</p>
        <p>It is his job to remain confident, upbeat, Manuel said, though he admitted after Thursday's victory that his turbulent tenure in Philadelphia had been costly.</p>
        <p>''The last three years, I think I lost quite a bit of hair,'' he said, laughing and rubbing his head. ''Philly's definitely taken that away from me.''</p>

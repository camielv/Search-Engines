        <p>One way to commemorate Earth Day on Sunday is by getting some new stuff -- well, new to you, anyway -- at Swap-O-Rama-Rama. Participants at this huge clothing swap arrive bearing bags of their (laundered) castoffs; organizers sort the goods into piles; and everyone dives in, searching for the perfect skinny jeans, wrap dress or button-down. Everything from shoes to jewelry is acceptable to trade, and there's no limit on what you can walk out with. Fellow swappers offer a fresh perspective on whether that polka-dot top really goes with that bubble skirt, and they supply a competitive thrill of the hunt (hands off that bubble skirt!). Meanwhile, volunteers with sewing machines (like those at last year's swap, above) help alter garments to fit, and local designers apply their skills and scissors to give well-loved T-shirts some extra flair. The fashion free-for-all culminates in a runway show of reclaimed and redesigned outfits: it's barter couture. (Eat your heart out, Karl Lagerfeld.) ''There's a lot of serendipitous creativity,'' said Wendy Tremayne, who founded the swap in 2005 as a way to encourage community, send up consumerism and, of course, get free stuff. Since then it has spawned dozens of offshoots; organizers in cities from Vancouver to Jerusalem hold their own versions of the event. But New York's swaps -- this is the fourth -- are among the biggest. ''There will be thousands of pounds of clothing,'' Ms. Tremayne said. ''And the thing that you think, 'Oh this is just junk that nobody would like' -- that's what someone loves. The beauty is in seeing the potential in anything.'' Especially a bargain. (Sunday, from 1 to 6 p.m., Eisner and Lubin Auditorium, New York University, 60 Washington Square South, Fourth Floor, swaporamarama.org; $10 plus one bag of clothes required for entry.)</p>

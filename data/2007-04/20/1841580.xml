        <p>If you were drawing breath in 1957, you probably remember the anxiety that gripped America after the Soviet Union launched its first sputnik satellite. The hand wringing was so fierce, it's amazing that people didn't break their fingers. Oh, Lordy, they cried, we're losing the space race.</p>
        <p>Then we had a ''missile gap'' with the Russians, or so John F. Kennedy led us to believe at his more hyperbolic moments in the 1960 presidential race.</p>
        <p>Somehow we overcame. But now we face the toughest crisis of all. This one might not be resolved with some no-sweat achievement like putting a man on the moon.</p>
        <p>We have a heavyweight gap, and it is serious. Russians and other former subjects of the Soviet empire are, quite literally, knocking America senseless in boxing's upper echelons. The only thing standing between them and total hegemony is a fellow from Brownsville, Brooklyn, named Shannon Briggs, an African-American who has described himself as ''the Great Black Hope.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Briggs, a professional fighter since Bush the Elder was president, is the lone non-Sovietnik to hold a heavyweight title, the one sanctioned by the World Boxing Organization. On June 2, in Atlantic City, he will defend it against -- what else? -- a Russian, name of Sultan Ibragimov.</p>
        <p>To hear both men tell it, national pride and character are on the line.</p>
        <p>They appeared together the other day at one of the sport's familiar rituals, a prefight news conference. It is the kind of gathering that, at its most primal, has testosterone flowing more freely than the on-the-house spirits. The event this time, held at the Copacabana club on West 34th Street, was rather tame. The boxers raised their fists and stared menacingly at each other, but they were just going through the motions for the cameras. Everyone had probably watched too many ''Rocky'' movies.</p>
        <p>Still, the undercurrent of nationalism was unmistakable.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to fighting for the title, keeping it here in America,'' said Mr. Briggs, who at 35 is 3 years older than Mr. Ibragimov. He is also taller and heavier. The fight won't go beyond Round 1, he predicted. ''I got 29 first-round knockouts,'' Mr. Briggs said. ''He's going to be No. 30.''</p>
        <p>In your dreams, Mr. Ibragimov said, or something to that effect. There is a reason, he said, that Russian heavyweights have done so well while once-dominant Americans find themselves on the canvas.</p>
        <p>''Russian boxers hungry, winning fight for title, money -- everything,'' he said. His English may have been imperfect, but not his meaning. ''American not so as hungry as Russians,'' he said, patting his stomach for emphasis. ''They work not so hard.''</p>
        <p>MANY Americans agree. A boxing writer at the event said it was received wisdom that too many American fighters went soft and ''fell asleep at the switch.''</p>
        <p>One result is that men from the former Soviet Union hold three of boxing's four heavyweight titles. Each is controlled by a different sanctioning body; the sport has more initials than Campbell's soup. Two of those three title holders are Russians. The other is a Ukrainian.</p>
        <p>And then there is Shannon Briggs, who beat a Russian to become the W.B.O. champ last November. ''The only thing I'm good at is boxing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That is not quite accurate. He is also good at talking. Even if Mr. Ibragimov were able to speak better English, he'd have been hard-pressed to keep up with the nonstop patter of Mr. Briggs, he with his blond-dyed dreadlocks tied in a knot.</p>
        <p>The two men were supposed to fight at Madison Square Garden last month, but Mr. Briggs, who has chronic asthma, caught pneumonia, forcing a cancellation. That brought derision from the Russian camp, words to the effect that Mr. Briggs lacked guts -- typically American. ''No heart,'' Mr. Ibragimov said. His manager, Boris Grinberg, kept up the taunts at the Copa.</p>
        <p>''Every day we pray God give Shannon Briggs health,'' he said. ''We need him to make fight with Sultan Ibragimov.'' To which Mr. Briggs replied, ''Be careful what you pray for.''</p>
        <p>Kidding aside, how deep does this Russia-vs.-America business go? ''I'm not really taking it to heart,'' Mr. Briggs said. ''Look, I'm just paying the bills. I'm not looking at it as a national thing or a race thing or a global thing.''</p>
        <p>But in the next breath, he suggested that nationalism and race do indeed matter. ''There's a black spot'' in the ranks of heavyweight champions, the man from Brownsville said somberly. ''That's me.''</p>

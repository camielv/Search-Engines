        <p>HARBEN--George Allen, 83, passed away peacefully at his home on April 17, 2007, following a long illness. He is survived by Marilynn LeVine, his wife of 43 years; sons Joshua, Jeb and Zeph; grandsons Leo and Aidan; a brother William Nathanial Harben and a sister, Judith Harben Alger. A graduate of Princeton University and a Marine Corps Veteran of World War II, he was an economist by trade and a painter, writer, philosopher and tennis player by avocation. George was a truly original man, and his absence will diminish all of our lives. Services, Friday, April 20th, 2pm at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th St. and Amsterdam Ave, Manhattan.</p>

        <p>BLACKBERRY BREAKDOWN -- The thumbs of about five million BlackBerry users in North America received an unexpected rest when a software change shut down the wireless e-mail service for more than 10 hours, beginning Tuesday evening. A statement laden with technical jargon later blamed a software upgrade at a network operations center that tracks all BlackBerry e-mail.</p>
        <p>Tests of the new software ''proved inadequate,'' the BlackBerry maker, Research in Motion, said. Even before the company confirmed the shutdown's cause, a competitor, Microsoft, was boasting that its wireless e-mail service did not rely on a potentially vulnerable centralized command post.</p>
        <p>Most analysts, however, expressed doubt that this week's blackout, and Research in Motion's lack of communications about it, would become a sales bonanza for Microsoft or other competitors.</p>

        <p>Residents of the mountain town of Monteleone di Spoleto held a noisy protest in front of the Italian Culture Ministry in Rome yesterday, calling for the return of an Etruscan chariot that's a centerpiece of the newly opened Greek and Roman galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 2,600-year-old chariot was discovered in Monteleone in 1902 and sold to the Met the next year. Monteleone officials now say it was illegally whisked out of the country. Some 200 people -- about a third of the town's population -- blew whistles and waved placards demanding that the Italian state, which does not support their claim, join their cause. The Met says that because the chariot (detail, right) was bought more than a century ago, the statute of limitations has expired. Nando Durastanti, Monteleone's mayor, who led the delegation, said the Met had ''closed itself off'' to requests to negotiate the artifact's return. ''Mind you, they've been very busy with the opening of the galleries,'' he said by telephone. ''They probably have other things on their minds than our chariot.''</p>

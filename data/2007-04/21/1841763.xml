        <p>Alliance Boots, the largest drugstore chain in Britain, became the target of a £10.8 billion ($21.6 billion) takeover battle Friday after a private equity firm and a medical charity raised their joint bid, hours after the board had accepted a rival offer.</p>
        <p>The new bid, which was raised to £11.15 a share from £10.85 a share, was made by Terra Firma Capital Partners, a private equity firm run by the financier Guy Hands, and the Wellcome Trust, the world's second-largest medical charity after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

        <p>Alliance Boots, the largest drugstore chain in Britain, became the target of a £10.8 billion ($21.6 billion) takeover battle Friday after a private equity firm and a medical charity raised their joint bid, hours after the board had accepted a rival offer.</p>
        <p>The new bid, which was raised to £11.15 a share from £10.85 a share, was made by Terra Firma Capital Partners, a private equity firm run by the financier Guy Hands, and the Wellcome Trust, the world's second-largest medical charity after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The group also includes HBOS, the biggest mortgage lender in Britain.</p>
        <p>Their bid topped an earlier offer from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stefano Pessina, the deputy chairman and largest shareholder of Alliance Boots.</p>
        <p>If either bidder succeeds, the deal would be the biggest corporate takeover ever in Europe.</p>
        <p>Alliance Boots shares rose 75.5 pence to close at £11.25 a share on Friday in London, indicating that investors expected Kohlberg Kravis and Mr. Pessina, whose bid of £10.90 a share was recommended Friday by the board of Alliance Boots, to come back with a higher offer.</p>
        <p>This is the first time that a trust has played such a dominant role as a potential buyer in a private equity bid. By acting alongside Terra Firma, Wellcome Trust would be taking on more risk but would also save the fees it normally pays private equity firms for making such investments.</p>
        <p>The trust, established in 1936 after the death of a pharmaceutical entrepreneur, Henry Wellcome, uses its endowment of about £13 billion to finance medical research.</p>
        <p>A deal for Alliance Boots, whose roots go back to an herbal remedies shop run by the Boot family in 1849, would also be the first takeover of a member of the FTSE 100-stock index by a private equity group.</p>
        <p>Alliance Boots sells beauty products and drugs as well as snacks through a chain of 3,100 stores and, through a wholesale drug supplier, more than 125,000 pharmacies and hospitals. It started a cost-cutting plan that includes job cuts after the merger of Alliance Unichem and the Boots Group last year.</p>

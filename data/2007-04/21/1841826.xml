        <p>BLACKBERRY users' thumbs were idle; private equity investors got a thumbs up from Sallie Mae; and a jury turned thumbs down on Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest.</p>
        <p>For Internet watchers, the week provided a study in contrasts.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Yahoo said its profit for the first three months of the year fell 11 percent from a year earlier, to $142 million, as sales grew 7 percent. Investors dumped the company's stock and it closed Friday at $27.46 a share.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Google reported its profit for the same period grew 69 percent, to $1 billion, as sales rose 63 percent. Shares surged more than 3 percent and closed Friday at $482.48 a share.</p>
        <p>The main story behind the numbers runs along the following lines: Yahoo is only now trying to figure out the best formula for linking search results with ads that users will click on; Google has been perfecting that formula for years.</p>
        <p>But things could change. Yahoo said it expected that a new search advertising system, which it unveiled in February, would begin delivering positive results to its bottom line starting in the current quarter. If so, Yahoo's next challenge will be to increase its share of all searches, which has remained relatively steady over the last year, while Google's share has inched steadily upward.</p>

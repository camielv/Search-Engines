        <p>A plan to charge drivers to bring their vehicles into the busiest parts of Manhattan, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is expected to propose tomorrow, faces daunting obstacles and even under the most optimistic conditions is likely to be years away, both supporters and opponents of the idea said.</p>
        <p>''I've always thought that it is a difficult thing to explain and a difficult political lift,'' Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday on his weekly program on WABC radio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg, who distanced himself from the idea -- known as congestion pricing -- in recent years, coyly refused to say if he would include it among the 127 proposals for the city's future that he intends to announce in a major Earth Day speech tomorrow. But he strongly defended it.</p>
        <p>He also acknowledged the difficulties, saying that such a plan would depend on approval by the State Legislature.</p>
        <p>Even seemingly simple proposals lacking in controversy, like one to expand a system of cameras that capture the license plates of drivers who run red lights, have foundered in Albany because of the opposition of a single legislator.</p>
        <p>Asked if congestion pricing could become a reality during the remaining two and a half years of his term, the mayor said, ''It's up to the Legislature, but I'd fight like heck to make it.''</p>
        <p>He avoided discussing details of the plan, including whether the fee to enter Midtown would be $8, as has been reported by several news organizations. But he tried to dismiss critics of the proposal, suggesting that most drivers could afford an added charge.</p>
        <p>''In this day and age it sounds like a lot of money, but you go to a movie and it's 12 bucks,'' he said. ''So let's put some of this stuff in perspective here.''</p>
        <p>Government officials and members of the business community who have been briefed on the plan in recent days said they were told it would include an $8 charge to drive into Manhattan's central business district, from the Battery to a point that could be as far uptown as 96th Street.</p>
        <p>Drivers, however, would receive credit for tolls paid during their trip, so someone with an E-ZPass who paid $5 to drive through the Holland Tunnel would be charged only $3.</p>
        <p>Residents of the zone where the charges would apply would pay $4 for trips within the zone, the people who attended the briefings said.</p>
        <p>Taxis would be exempt and so would drivers who crossed into Manhattan but then stayed on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive or the West Side Highway, thereby avoiding the busiest streets.</p>
        <p>The plan would be modeled on a much-lauded program in London, which began in 2003, where drivers are charged as much as $20 to bring their cars into the city center. The program has been credited with reducing traffic by as much as 17 percent.</p>
        <p>In London, drivers can pay the daily fee in several ways, including over the Internet or in stores. Cameras on the street record drivers' license plates and enter them into a database, which checks to make sure they have paid.</p>
        <p>A pilot program in Stockholm has used technology similar to E-ZPass, and it is likely that a New York congestion-charging plan would use some combination of cameras and E-ZPass.</p>
        <p>Officials briefed on the plan said that the city anticipates a start-up cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But the technology is the least of the mayor's worries.</p>
        <p>''It's going nowhere,'' said State Senator John D. Sabini from Queens, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Transportation Committee. ''I see it withering on the vine.''</p>
        <p>He was blunt in predicting opposition from influential legislators representing areas where many drivers to the city come from.</p>
        <p>''You will see an odd commingling of outer-borough legislators married to the same position as suburban legislators,'' Mr. Sabini said.</p>
        <p>Of his Queens constituents, he said: ''We put up with the exhaust of everyone going into Manhattan that drives through Queens. We put up with the exhaust of everyone driving to our airports. Now we're told we're not part of the city, and we've got to pay an extra fee to get into Midtown.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I think this goes back to the bad old days of Manhattan against the boroughs.''</p>
        <p>Many transit riders, who make up the vast majority of commuters into Manhattan, are likely to favor charging drivers a fee and using the money to improve bus and train services. But drivers like Chryssy Pellekanos objected bitterly to the idea.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pellekanos, 29, said she drives to Manhattan from her home in Astoria, Queens, five or six days a week as part of her work selling dermatological products. Just the cost of parking in a garage can cost more than $40 a day, she said.</p>
        <p>''It would take from my lunch money,'' she said of congestion pricing.</p>
        <p>Proponents of a congestion fee argue that it will actually bring benefits to the outer boroughs, reducing traffic there as well, especially in places like Downtown Brooklyn or parts of Queens where cars back up as they approach the bridges and tunnels to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>They have also contended that some of the revenue from a congestion-pricing plan -- estimated to be about $500 million a year -- should go toward improving bus and other transit services in far-flung parts of Queens and Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>But even supporters are keenly aware of the political difficulties.</p>
        <p>Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic consultant who favors congestion pricing, said that it would take at least four years before a plan could be approved and put in place. He said that completing an environmental impact study could take at least three years, and fighting the inevitable lawsuits would take another year.</p>
        <p>He also said it would become a hot issue in the next mayoral campaign.</p>
        <p>''It may be a political mistake to come out with it right now because candidates will run against it, and they will be courting voters in Brooklyn and Queens,'' Mr. Schwartz said.</p>
        <p>But he said supporters of congestion pricing could tap into an unusually broad base. Proponents of the idea include liberal environmental groups, business groups and even the conservative Manhattan Institute.</p>
        <p>''The rich go faster, you pay for it, it's first-class travel, it's all the things the right espouses,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''On the left side, the transportation activists and the ban-the-car groups, they all support it because it reduces car traffic and provides funding for transit.''</p>

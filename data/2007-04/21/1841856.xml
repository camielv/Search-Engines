        <p>A State Supreme Court justice declined yesterday to issue a restraining order temporarily halting the demolition of nine vacant buildings to make way for the Atlantic Yards project near Downtown Brooklyn. The restraining order had been requested by Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, which opposes the scale of the 22-acre project that is to encompass housing, office and retail space and a basketball arena. The group had argued that the developer, Forest City Ratner, should not be allowed to begin demolishing buildings before May 3, the date of a hearing on a lawsuit challenging the state's environmental review and approval of the project. Justice Joan Madden said that the plaintiffs had failed to substantiate their argument that the demolition would ''irrevocably harm the neighborhood,'' but that she was not judging the suit's merits.</p>

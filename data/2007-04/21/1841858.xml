        <p>Ronald O. Ross has resigned as superintendent of the troubled Roosevelt Union Free School District, state education officials announced yesterday. Mr. Ross, who was appointed in 2004 by Richard P. Mills, the education commissioner, will step down on June 30, the end of the current school year. In recent weeks, Mr. Ross has come under increasing criticism from local residents as the 2,800-student district, the only one under state oversight, has run up a budget deficit of as much as $12.3 million, according to a state audit. Mr. Ross, who earned $200,000 a year, could not be reached for comment.</p>

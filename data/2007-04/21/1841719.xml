        <p>10 P.M. (BBC America) WILD AT HEART -- Goodbye, city life! When Danny Trevanion (Stephen Tompkinson), an English veterinarian, saves the life of a monkey smuggled illegally into Britain, his new wife, Sarah (Amanda Holden), decides that they and their children -- his teenage daughter, Rosie (Lucy-Jo Hudson), and Sarah's 8-year-old daughter, Olivia (Rafaella Hutchinson), and 13-year-old son, Evan (Luke Ward-Wilkinson) -- should travel to South Africa to return the monkey to its natural habitat, and, with luck, bond as a family along the way. (Above, from left, Ms. Holden, Ms. Hutchinson and Ms. Hudson.) But that charmingly decrepit game reserve is just too tempting to leave behind. The six-episode first season of this new series follows the Trevanions as they rumble in the jungle.</p>
        <p>9:45 P.M. (HBO) THE MUSIC OF 'THE SOPRANOS' -- David Chase, the show's creator, discusses the soundtrack to Tony Soprano's life, from ''Woke Up This Morning'' by A3 and ''It's Bad You Know'' by R. L. Burnside to Bruce Springsteen's ''State Trooper'' and Wyclef Jean's ''Blood Is Thicker Than Water.''</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (BBC America) ROBIN HOOD -- Djaq (Anjali Jay) is captured at Locksley when the gang raids Gisborne's party in honor of King Richard's birthday. And Robin discovers something terrible about Gisborne that sends him reeling.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (History) THE STATES -- Everything you ever wanted to know about the 50 states, but had forgotten -- or something like that. This new 10-part refresher course gives mini-tours of five states in each episode through legends, little-known facts, colorful characters and state-of-the-art graphics. First up: California's car culture; North Carolina's cash crop; Kansas' pro- and anti-slavery factions; New Hampshire's granite; and West Virginia's coal miners.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (TLC) MY FIRST HOME -- A nuts-and-bolts primer for first-time buyers, from open houses to escrow.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Sundance) C.R.A.Z.Y. -- (2005) Zac Beaulieu (Marc-André Grondin) was born prematurely in 1960. He spent his teens as a sexually ambiguous David Bowie fanatic. His father, who harbors his own affection for Patsy Cline and Charles Aznavour, wishes Zac would grow up to be a man's man, but tries to understand. So do Zac's four brothers and devoutly Roman Catholic mother. Writing in The New York Times, the critic Stephen Holden called this humorously poignant film from the Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallée ''wonderful'' and ''the kind of truthful family drama that Hollywood seems incapable of making.''</p>
        <p>11 P.M. (Comedy Central) OMID DJALILI -- This British-Iranian comedian, soon to be seen in the third installment of ''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' goes multicultural in riffs on terrorism, belly dancing and anti-racism workshops in his new stand-up routine.</p>
        <p>11:30 (NBC) SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE -- The sultry Scarlett Johansson, right, is guest host; the otherworldly Bjork performs from her new album, ''Volta,'' whose first single is ''Earth Intruders.''</p>

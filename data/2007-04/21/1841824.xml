        <p>BLACKBERRY users' thumbs were idle; private equity investors got a thumbs up from Sallie Mae; and a jury turned thumbs down on Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest.</p>
        <p>Real competition appears to be breaking out in the race to bring very-low-cost computers to people in developing nations. Microsoft said this week that it would sell a stripped-down version of Windows and Office for $3 in developing nations. Analysts say basic PC's running the Microsoft programs could sell for $300 or less.</p>
        <p>The Microsoft push comes as a nonprofit project, One Laptop Per Child, is about to begin production. The project's laptop will cost about $150, uses a version of Linux -- a free alternative to Windows -- and is backed by Google, among others. Both the Microsoft program and One Laptop Per Child will sell computers to governments that will then distribute them to individuals, mainly schoolchildren.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen how many governments will decide that they should spend scarce funds on computers, when they have so many other pressing needs likes literacy, malnutrition and health care. Another issue is that the vehicle for bringing Internet computing to poorer nations may not be the computer at all, but the cellphone.</p>

        <p>The number of applications from same-sex couples seeking licenses for civil unions increased in the second month that they were available, the state reported yesterday. According to figures released by the state health department, 373 couples applied in the period from March 20 to April 20, up from 229 in the first month after the civil union law went into effect on Feb. 19. Despite the increase, the number of applicants still lags behind the number of same-sex couples who applied for domestic partnerships in 2004, when that option became available and 1,700 couples signed up in the first month alone. Of the 373 same-sex couples who applied in the last month, 17 said that they had equivalent partnerships in other states or Canada.</p>

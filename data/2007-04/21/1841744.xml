      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In just over a month, six young men have blown themselves up in Morocco, causing intense worry in a nation that has largely escaped local terrorism.</p>
        <p>But apart from the bombers themselves, only one person was killed -- a blessing but also a puzzle.</p>
        <p>''I am very happy that they didn't kill anyone else -- no friend and no enemy,'' said Abed Maha, 61, the grieving and baffled father of two men who exploded themselves near the American Consulate here last Saturday. ''They were the only victims.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, deep uncertainties have left the government in a state of ''extreme alert'' over whether this moderate Muslim society faces a new terrorist threat against its own government and tourist sites.</p>
        <p>In an interview on Thursday, the nation's interior minister, Chakib Benmoussa, took a careful line, playing down some fears while raising others. So far, he said, there appeared to be no links between the Morocco bombers and the deadly attacks last week in Algeria, where militants have formally attached themselves to Al Qaeda. And in the attack near the American Consulate last Saturday, he said the bombers seemed to go out of their way to avoid other casualties.</p>
        <p>The attack Saturday followed one the previous Tuesday, in which three men blew themselves up in the Hay Farah district here, and another on March 11, when a militant blew himself up in a cybercafe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benmoussa said the bombers last week seemed to have come from two groups, not one, as originally reported here. This means that, within a few days, two distinct groups showed themselves capable of making powerful suicide belts and carrying out attacks.</p>
        <p>That indicates that the Qaeda ideology, combined with the availability of easy bomb-making recipes on the Internet, appears to be growing deeper roots here.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Benmoussa said that the main cell uncovered here recently, comprising some 40 people, wanted to hit government institutions or tourist sites, even if it had no concrete plans to do so immediately. The three men who died in the first episode last week were part of that cell, but blew themselves up in their apartment during a police raid. One policeman was killed.</p>
        <p>''We are aware that they will try again and again,'' he said. ''We are now in some kind of race where we have to remain very vigilant, with a very high level of security.''</p>
        <p>The Morocco suicide bombings last week coincided with two attacks across the border in Algeria on April 11 that killed 33 people, in the deadliest bombings there in years. As a result, terrorism experts have begun to worry that Al Qaeda, which took responsibility for the Algeria attack, is focusing more on northern Africa.</p>
        <p>''Morocco is in a state of extreme alert, and this situation prevails as much in Casablanca as in other cities and sensitive zones in the country,'' the communications minister, Nabil Benbdellah, told reporters in Rabat, the capital, on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The American Consulate in Casablanca has closed amid tightened security at other consulates, hotels and police stations. Security forces patrol the highways, searching cars and slowing traffic.</p>
        <p>Skeptics say that the government has an interest in minimizing any local connections with Al Qaeda to avoid scaring away foreign investment and tourism.</p>
        <p>Even if the Moroccan bombings were not related to Al Qaeda or the attacks in Algeria, they nonetheless stand out.</p>
        <p>Terrorism experts say that in recent years the focus of Moroccan extremists has been on recruiting fighters for Iraq, as earlier generations of other militants went to Afghanistan and Bosnia. Security officials here estimate that 50 Moroccans have gone to Iraq, many as suicide bombers, with two dozen coming from a single city, Tetouan, in the north.</p>
        <p>''The only goal of these cells and the network is to force these regimes to let them do what they want to do, which is to recruit people for Iraq,'' said Mohammed Darif, an expert on Islamic terrorist groups at King Hassan II University here. ''They want to fight there.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Benmoussa said that while groups did exist to recruit for Iraq, the larger cell uncovered here last week was focused internally. In fact, he said, investigations show it was a remnant of the group that carried out attacks here in 2003 that hit foreign hotels and Jewish sites, killing 33 people.</p>
        <p>He said that the police began following the group in February, and that police pressure led to the explosion that killed one militant, apparently by accident, in the March 11 episode in the cybercafe.</p>
        <p>Then, five weeks ago, a group of young men, all from the shantytown of Sidi Moumen to the city's north, rented a room in Hay Farah. Their landlady, who would give only her first name, Jamaa, said they had paid $280 in advance for two months, prompting some suspicion for not disputing the price.</p>
        <p>On April 10, the police raided the building and three of the men blew themselves up, killing one policeman. A fourth man was shot to death.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the attacks in Algeria last week, where the bombers used plastic explosives, the bombs in Casablanca were homemade, of acetone and cleaning supplies, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Then on Saturday, just before 9 a.m., two men exploded themselves near the American Consulate and an American-owned language school here.</p>
        <p>But the bombs did not go off directly at either place, raising questions about what the bombers intended. Indeed, despite strong warnings afterward from the United States Mission about the possibility of new attacks against Americans, Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman in Washington, said, ''We don't know'' if American interests were being singled out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benmoussa said security officials now believed that the Saturday attack was by a completely different cell: an extremist older brother who recruited his ''normal'' younger brother into a ''spectacular suicide'' completely on their own.</p>
        <p>Confounding usual patterns of attack, he said that surveillance videos suggested that the men actively tried not to kill others. One approached a guard and then retreated before exploding himself. A note left behind, he said, protested injustice in the Middle East, including Iraq.</p>
        <p>To some Moroccans, the attack suggested a vague anger, rather than an action coordinated with outside jihadist groups seeking maximum casualties and attention.</p>
        <p>Apart from their own safety, Moroccans have been debating the complicated causes that may lurk behind last week's bombings. The elements include anger over the Iraq war, felt at all levels of society here; the reach of Al Qaeda's jihadist model; and, above all, how poverty may feed extremism.</p>
        <p>Four of the six men who killed themselves lived in poverty in Sidi Moumen; the bombers in 2003 also came from there. At that time, Morocco promised to enact measures against poverty and to lift some restrictions on civil rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benmoussa, the interior minister, said many strides had been made. But others are not satisfied.</p>
        <p>''The answer to extremism is more political openness, more democracy, more human rights improvement, empowering young people, empowering women,'' said Mustapha Khalfi, a leader in the moderate Islamist Justice and Development Party, a growing political force here.</p>
        <p>''With this, I think Morocco will win this war,'' he said.</p>

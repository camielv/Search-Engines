        <p>A building inspector found a man's body yesterday in the basement of 542 Bainbridge Street in Ocean Hill, the police said. The victim, identified as Donell Johnson, 22, a tenant of the apartment building, was found face down with a gunshot wound to his head, the police said. Investigators he said that Mr. Johnson was probably murdered because no weapon was found near his body. It was unclear last night how long the body had been in the basement.</p>

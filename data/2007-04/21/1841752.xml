        <p>I MARCHED into battle with my electrified mask and saber in hand, trying to summon the spirit of Zorro. I was in a cavernous space on the fifth floor of an office building in Chelsea that houses the Fencers Club, the august capital of American swordsmanship. Having taken just one lesson, I was about to engage in my first fencing bout.</p>
        <p>My opponent, Konate Primus, a 20-year-old college student, hunkered at the far end of the 26-foot strip that would serve as our battlefield. Like me, he was swathed in white knee socks, white knickers and a gray lamé electrified jacket. But Konate had been fencing for three years, and he had the rock-solid build of a prizefighter.</p>

        <p>I MARCHED into battle with my electrified mask and saber in hand, trying to summon the spirit of Zorro. I was in a cavernous space on the fifth floor of an office building in Chelsea that houses the Fencers Club, the august capital of American swordsmanship. Having taken just one lesson, I was about to engage in my first fencing bout.</p>
        <p>My opponent, Konate Primus, a 20-year-old college student, hunkered at the far end of the 26-foot strip that would serve as our battlefield. Like me, he was swathed in white knee socks, white knickers and a gray lamé electrified jacket. But Konate had been fencing for three years, and he had the rock-solid build of a prizefighter.</p>
        <p>I glanced nervously at Mika'il Sankofa, 43, who was standing beside the strip in a thickly padded black teaching jacket. Tall and supple with an infectious smile, he was a United States Fencing Association Hall of Fame competitor turned coach and referee.</p>
        <p>''Fencers salute!'' Mika'il commanded.</p>
        <p>Konate and I pulled on our masks. We were connected to an electronic scoreboard via wires than ran from the hand guards of our weapons out the backs of our jackets up to reels mounted on the ceiling. As a result, we looked like high-tech mummy puppets raising and then lowering our sabers to salute each other and then turning to salute Mika'il.</p>
        <p>''Fencers ready?'' Mika'il asked.</p>
        <p>Konate and I toed the black en garde lines on our respective ends of the strip, hoisting our sabers at 45 degree angles.</p>
        <p>''In fencing, the defining element is technique,'' Mika'il had informed me earlier that evening. ''There are no height classes and no weight classes. I've seen 80-year-old guys defeat young whippersnappers. Everybody has the chance to be the best and seize the moment. You've just got to go for it.''</p>
        <p>As I waited for Mika'il to give the command to begin my bout against Konate, everything I knew about fencing flashed before my mind's eye. It wasn't much. With only an hour or so of formal instruction, my technique was based primarily on memories of watching actors fight with swords on television and in the movies. But I had already learned that theatrical fencing is a far cry from the real thing.</p>
        <p>The rules and weapons of modern competitive fencing descend from 16th-century European martial arts traditions. One of only four sports featured in every Olympic Games since 1896, fencing attracts women and men worldwide. It remains especially popular in Italy, France, Spain, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Russia, and it has lately been catching on in China and other parts of Asia.</p>
        <p>I discovered to my surprise that fencing is also enjoying a miniboom in the United States. The Fencers Club claims to be the oldest continuously existing organization in the Western Hemisphere dedicated exclusively to teaching and promoting fencing. Founded in 1883, it boasts a roster of national and world-class champions dating to the turn of the previous century. The current club chairman, James Melcher, competed in the 1972 Olympics. Eight other club members dueled for the 2000 and 2004 United States Olympic teams.</p>
        <p>The United States Fencing Association lists clubs in all 50 states and at 50 colleges and universities. The equipment is only moderately expensive compared with, say, recreational bowling: a starter kit of fencing regalia, including a set of swords (you need more than one because they break), is about $400. Lesson rates and equipment rental rates are comparable to those in tennis or golf.</p>
        <p>Mr. Melcher said the Fencers Club in Manhattan had more than 470 members, up from 50 a decade ago. Along with a predictable sampling from Wall Street, recent converts to the sport include a growing contingent of minority youth. Like Konate Primus, many have come to the sport through the sponsorship of the Peter Westbrook Foundation and the outreach efforts of Mika'il Sankofa.</p>
        <p>Mika'il literally stumbled into fencing at age 9 when his mother sent him to a Long Island recreation center to sign up for Little League baseball. (''I turned left at the end of the hall when I should have turned right,'' he recalled. ''They put a sword in my hand instead of a bat.'') He went on to win four consecutive N.C.A.A. titles at New York University and two national championships. A three-time Olympian, he recently received his fencing maestro degree with honors from Semmelweis University in Budapest.</p>
        <p>''What I love about fencing is that it's an individual sport with instant gratification,'' he confided. ''You know right away if you've won or you've lost, and you have no one else to blame but yourself.''</p>
        <p>As Mika'il explained, modern competitive fencing consists of three disciplines: épée, foil and saber. The epee is a 26-inch fine-bladed rapier. Unlike two-handed swords used for cutting or bludgeoning enemies, it is a thrusting weapon. According to Mika'il, the épée made heavy armor obsolete because it could penetrate the cracks. In épée, the target is the opponent's entire body.</p>
        <p>The foil was developed as a training tool for the one-handed court sword. It is also a thrusting weapon, but it has a lighter and more flexible blade than the épée . In foil, the target is confined to the opponent's torso.</p>
        <p>In contrast to épée and foil, the saber is a cutting weapon with a triangular blade. Mika'il said it was derived from cavalry swords used to attack enemy riders without killing their horses. In saber, the target is everything above the opponent's waist excepting the hands but including the arms and head.</p>
        <p>Since Mika'il is a saber specialist, I made that my weapon of choice. Our lesson started with basic footwork. I learned how to advance, retreat and lunge. He showed me three types of parries, a fencing term for defensive methods. Although each of the parries had a technical name, I could remember them only as high, low and middle. With the aid of a cloth-stuffed dummy, he taught me three offensive blows: a head cut, a flank cut and a belly cut.</p>
        <p>Next thing I knew, I was facing Konate Primus on a strip in the Fencers Club teaching area. Mika'il said the first one to score five points would win the bout. Although the rules of saber fencing involve arcane subtleties like the concept of ''right of way,'' I figured that it all boiled down to a boxing match with swords -- the idea was to hit your opponent without getting hit.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for me, Konate knew his stuff, as I'd discerned a few minutes earlier when I asked him about the utility of an old-fashioned sport like fencing in today's world. ''You never know what life brings,'' he had replied. ''One day I might be in a sword fight, and I'll have the upper hand.''</p>
        <p>A nanosecond after Mika'il issued the command to start fencing, Konate advanced across the red centerline of our strip, and plunged his saber into the breast of my electrified lamé jacket. A red light flashed on the scoreboard confirming that he had scored the first point.</p>
        <p>I regrouped, once again summoning the spirit of Zorro. To my astonishment, the improvised theatrical moves I'd learned from my childhood TV hero seemed to take Konate by surprise. I feinted when he expected me to lunge, and cut when he expected me to parry. We battled on for two full minutes, punctuated by clashing metal and primal outcries. In the end, Mika'il awarded me a 5-4 victory.</p>
        <p>''You just let me win, didn't you?'' I asked Konate.</p>
        <p>''Maybe,'' he replied, grinning.</p>
        <p>We lowered our sabers, removed our masks, and shook with ungloved hands like two gentlemanly duelists. All I could think to say to him was, ''Touché!''</p>

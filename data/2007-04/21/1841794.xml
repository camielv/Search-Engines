        <p>Any foreigner in the old Soviet Union knew to search for decent food at the immigrants' stalls of the nearest farmers' market. The offerings sold in state stores often looked faintly gray, suffering from age or freezer burn. By contrast, the markets like Cheryomushski, near our apartment in Moscow, were full of color and life and fresh vegetables. People from the Caucasus were there, laughing and bargaining and, undoubtedly, making fun of bumbling customers like me. In midwinter, they sold exquisite lemons or fresh cilantro, hand-carried from the south, oranges in artful pyramids and brown eggs, some with tiny feathers still attached. And the butcher carved the meat before your eyes. With an ax.</p>
        <p>Now the Russian government has decided that immigrants, even legal ones, no longer belong in the nation's 5,200 markets. Since April 1, only Russian citizens have been allowed to sell spices or vegetables. In only a few weeks, the markets have been drained of their full-bodied flavors, and many stalls are empty.</p>

        <p>Any foreigner in the old Soviet Union knew to search for decent food at the immigrants' stalls of the nearest farmers' market. The offerings sold in state stores often looked faintly gray, suffering from age or freezer burn. By contrast, the markets like Cheryomushski, near our apartment in Moscow, were full of color and life and fresh vegetables. People from the Caucasus were there, laughing and bargaining and, undoubtedly, making fun of bumbling customers like me. In midwinter, they sold exquisite lemons or fresh cilantro, hand-carried from the south, oranges in artful pyramids and brown eggs, some with tiny feathers still attached. And the butcher carved the meat before your eyes. With an ax.</p>
        <p>Now the Russian government has decided that immigrants, even legal ones, no longer belong in the nation's 5,200 markets. Since April 1, only Russian citizens have been allowed to sell spices or vegetables. In only a few weeks, the markets have been drained of their full-bodied flavors, and many stalls are empty.</p>
        <p>The idea, President Vladimir Putin said last year, is that barring immigrants will ''ease tension on the labor market and make it more civilized.'' In reality, this dreadful law exhibits the worst of Russian instincts. This nationalism, this visceral fear and dislike of non-Russians, is a destructive force for the immigrants and a self-destructive force for the Russians.</p>
        <p>As one Uzbek told the Times reporter Andrew E. Kramer, ''In the street there is hate for immigrants.'' SOVA, the anti-hate-crime organization in Russia, has estimated that so far this year, 23 immigrants have died and 149 have been wounded in what it terms ethnically motivated attacks. Since April 1, the police have raided the markets with buses to round up people and send them back to former Soviet states like Azerbaijan or Uzbekistan or Georgia. Notices on market doors advertise space now for ''farmers from the Fatherland.''</p>
        <p>Such xenophobia should horrify anyone with a grounding in Russian and German history. But for Russia to ban immigrants from Georgia is much like banning Georgian wine, another government mistake that makes Russians go without some of the best wines in the region. This sprawling nation, which is losing population, needs to find a way to welcome ambitious newcomers instead of excluding them. Russia's fate, like its empty market stalls, will grow insular and gray unless Russia brings in these vibrant people and their exotic wares.</p>

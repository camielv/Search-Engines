        <p>NBC, the network that was sent the videos of the Virginia Tech gunman and used them most extensively, and other cable and broadcast networks backed sharply away from showing the images yesterday.</p>

But their actions follow fierce criticism of the news media, newspapers as well as television, by students, victims' family members and others.

        <p>NBC, the network that was sent the videos of the Virginia Tech gunman and used them most extensively, and other cable and broadcast networks backed sharply away from showing the images yesterday.</p>
        <p>The networks said the shift reflected a journalistic judgment and not a response to complaints. But their actions follow fierce criticism of the news media, newspapers as well as television, by students, victims' family members and others. The critics said the coverage had been too intrusive and insensitive to survivors and served only to give the killer, Seung-Hui Cho, the attention he wanted.</p>
        <p>One Virginia Tech student, Robert Jakubowski, 20, a junior from Brick, N.J., described watching cameramen refuse to leave a grieving family and a photographer taking photos of crying women even after they asked them to leave. Some students said reporters had interviewed them three or four times.</p>
        <p>Others handed out fliers saying, ''Media go home.''</p>
        <p>Newsrooms and chat rooms had debates about the boundaries of propriety and taste, always a slippery border made more elusive in an age of viral video and increasingly bloody news and entertainment.</p>
        <p>On Web site of The Chronicle of Higher Education, www.chronicle.com, a discussion group on the Virginia coverage had many posts like one saying that thanks to the news media, ''Cho, in death, is taking everyone hostage by his videos.''</p>
        <p>There is nothing new about criminals trying to manipulate the news media for aggrandizement and gratification. The Zodiac and Son of Sam killers, among others, wrote cryptic messages to newspapers. The Unabomber wrote a large manifesto. And the newspapers, including The New York Times, published them.</p>
        <p>The visceral impact of Mr. Cho's video represented an evolution of this virulent strain, updated for a time when any act, no matter how odd or personal, seems destined for immortality on the Web and cycled through 24-hour news channels.</p>
        <p>Each of the earlier cases had the plausible suggestion that publishing the message would prevent further harm. Now, Mr. Cho was dead before his videos were shown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cho used a break in his rampage to send a package to NBC with hours of video of himself on DVDs, along with photos and writings. Beginning on Wednesday, NBC and its 24-hour cable news channel, MSNBC, made extensive use of the video, especially scenes of Mr. Cho's staring into the camera, venting his hatred of other students and his grandiose self-view. The network said I it showed a small fraction of what it had.</p>
        <p>Other networks copied the images and rebroadcast them under the doctrine of fair use. NBC shared some photos.</p>
        <p>The reactions have focused on the video, yet it remains available on the Internet, including segments posted or linked to by the Web sites of newspapers, including The Times. Newspapers said yesterday that the complaints they had received were mostly about using the photos that Mr. Cho took of himself brandishing pistols.</p>
        <p>Early Thursday, ABC said it would no longer show the video. On Thursday, evening, CBS and Fox followed. NBC said it would limit the material to no more than 10 percent of news broadcast time.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, CNN said that with limited exceptions it would not show the video any more. NBC did not show any of it, or photos of Mr. Cho that showed guns, in its nightly newscast. MSNBC used little, if any, of the video.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for NBC News, Allison Gollust, said executives debated yesterday morning whether to issue an ''official directive'' on the images, but ''decided it didn't seem necessary, because we expected to use so little of it.''</p>
        <p>All the major networks said they had judged that the disturbing nature of the images took precedence, because they had lost their news value. Coincidentally or not, they had lost their commercial value, too. Incomplete Nielsen popularity ratings show that the number of viewers spiked on Wednesday, particularly for ''The NBC Nightly News'' and CNN dropped on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Amid the ire, there has been little or no criticism of the video on the Internet, including the Web sites of several newspapers that used a 109-second clip, supplied by The Associated Press, of Mr. Cho speaking into a camera. Editors at some major papers said it never occurred to them not to use the clip. ''I was more worried about the photos, maybe because of the guns,'' said Jim Roberts, editor of digital news at The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The Times received complaints from victims' friends for copying pictures from memorial pages on MySpace and similar Web sites.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a photo of Mr. Cho pointing a semiautomatic handgun and received 20 negative reader e-mail messages and phone calls, said Angela Tuck, the public editor.</p>
        <p>''Anytime we get 20 or 30 calls, that's unusual,'' Ms. Tuck said. ''They felt it was insensitive to the families, and the photo was too big and they'd already seen so much.''</p>

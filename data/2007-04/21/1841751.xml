        <p>TALL people should pay more in taxes than short people, a Harvard economics professor, N. Gregory Mankiw, and his student, Matthew Weinzierl, argue in a paper published last week (gregmankiw.blogspot.com)</p>
        <p>''This paper can be interpreted in one of two ways,'' the men write. ''Some readers can take it as a small, quirky contribution aimed to clarify the literature on optimal income taxation. Others can take it as a broader effort to challenge that entire literature.'' Mr. Mankiw was chief of the White House Council of Economic Advisors from 2003 to 2005. Mr. Weinzierl is a fourth-year doctoral student.</p>

        <p>TALL people should pay more in taxes than short people, a Harvard economics professor, N. Gregory Mankiw, and his student, Matthew Weinzierl, argue in a paper published last week (gregmankiw.blogspot.com)</p>
        <p>''This paper can be interpreted in one of two ways,'' the men write. ''Some readers can take it as a small, quirky contribution aimed to clarify the literature on optimal income taxation. Others can take it as a broader effort to challenge that entire literature.'' Mr. Mankiw was chief of the White House Council of Economic Advisors from 2003 to 2005. Mr. Weinzierl is a fourth-year doctoral student.</p>
        <p>As with most academic writing about economics, the paper, titled ''The Optimal Taxation of Height: A Case Study of Utilitarian Income Redistribution,'' comes complete with charts, graphs, complex formulas and incomprehensible language. It may be a satire of progressive taxation (or of what the authors call ''utilitarian social planners''), but it makes use of all the formal tools of analysis.</p>
        <p>''This result has two possible interpretations,'' the men write with tongue-bulged cheeks. ''One interpretation is that individual attributes correlated with wages, such as height, should be considered more widely for determining tax liabilities.</p>
        <p>''Alternatively, if policies such as a tax on height are rejected, then the standard utilitarian framework must in some way fail to capture our intuitive notions of distributive justice.''</p>
        <p>Professor Frank Pasquale of Seton Hall Law School does not think much of the satire or of its implied argument. On the legal blog Concurring Opinions, he writes that the paper was ''designed to reconcile us to inequality'' and that in any case, tax policies aimed at redistributing wealth do not really map to human height or lack thereof (concurringopinions.com).</p>
        <p>If, he wrote, ''there were thousands of people around who were, say, hundreds of times taller than the average person, and whose ability to consume resources were accordingly disparate, perhaps we'd try to find some way of rectifying the situation.'' But there are not.</p>
        <p>''It is easy enough to score debating points about the 'impossibility' of perfect distributive justice,'' he continues. ''But in a nation where an ever-growing number of people lack basic health insurance, and a world where tens of millions live on a dollar a day and a substantial proportion of the affluent do nothing to relieve their plight, it's really difficult to see how reductiones ad absurda contribute to the practical decisions we have to make about distributing resources. Parlor games don't lead to good policy.''</p>
        <p>LONG-TERM RESULTS -- Kongo Gumi, which had been in business for an astounding 1,428 years, closed last year, saddled with debt and facing diminishing business prospects.</p>
        <p>The consultant James Olan Hutcheson took a look at the Japanese temple builder this week for Business Week Online. ''How,'' he asked, ''do you make a family business last for 14 centuries?'' It helps, he wrote, if the business operates in a stable industry. ''Few industries could be less flighty than Buddhist temple construction,'' which made up about 80 percent of Kongo Gumi's revenue in recent years (www.businessweek.com).</p>
        <p>Those who wish to emulate the company, Mr. Hutcheson wrote, ''should mingle elements of conservatism and flexibility.'' That strategy kept Kongo Gumi in the same family for its whole existence and helped it survive hard times as ''when it switched temporarily to crafting coffins during World War II.''</p>
        <p>It was ''a set of ordinary circumstances that brought Kongo Gumi down at last,'' Mr. Hutcheson wrote. Those were overinvestment in real estate and a drop in contributions to Japanese temples.</p>
        <p>MAKING A DENT -- Volkswagen's recent marketing effort, placing color-matched magnetic stickers on parked cars, making them look as if they were dented, was a ''cool idea,'' according to German Car Blog (germancarblog.com). No, it was ''just dumb,'' said Auto Blog (autoblog.com). ''Somehow we don't think that scaring the heck out of a car owner will entice him or her to drop $15K on a VW.''</p>

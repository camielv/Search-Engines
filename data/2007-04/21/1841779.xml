        <p>U.S. Erects Baghdad Wall To Separate Rival Sects  American military commanders in Baghdad are trying a radical new strategy to quell sectarian violence by building a 12-foot-high, three-mile-long wall to separate a historic Sunni enclave from Shiite neighborhoods. But Sunni Arab residents say it will only increase tensions.  PAGE A6</p>
        <p>Tax the Rich, Hopefuls Say  The leading Democratic presidential candidates say they would raise a taxes on affluent people but extend President Bush's tax cuts for middle- and lower-income families.  PAGE A10</p>
        <p>A Dilemma for Bush  President Bush has stood by embattled lieutenants time and again, but his loyalty is being put to the test by the cases of Alberto R. Gonzales and Paul Wolfowitz.  PAGE A11</p>
        <p>The World Bank extended an inquiry into Mr. Wolfowitz.  PAGE A8</p>
        <p>Rivera and Yanks Fall to Sox  Mariano Rivera blew his second save in a week as the Red Sox stormed back in the eighth inning to defeat the Yankees, 7-6, at Fenway Park. Alex Rodriguez hit two more home runs to continue his torrid start.  SPORTSSATURDAY, PAGE D1</p>
        <p>THIS WEEKEND</p>
        <p>The Two-Year Attraction  Almost half of all undergraduates now attend community colleges, making the two-year experience as much the norm as not. A look at who's attending and why, and where they are going, with a guide to some of the country's best two-year colleges.</p>
        <p>Also: Senior slackers, beware: admissions offices can (and do) take back acceptances. EDUCATION LIFE</p>

        <p>A contract worker brandishing a revolver took control of part of a Johnson Space Center building on Friday afternoon, and killed a hostage and then himself after a standoff with the police.</p>
        <p>Another hostage, identified as Fran Crenshaw, was not harmed. After the three-hour standoff, F.B.I. agents and the police began trying to figure out what relationship, if any, the gunman had with the hostages.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what any of the relations were at this time,'' Capt. Dwayne Ready of the Houston police said of the three people involved in the incident. ''I am sure we will learn if there were any relationships, and what they may have been.''</p>
        <p>Captain Ready said the police had not found any note by the gunman, identified as Bill Phillips. The police later searched his house for clues.</p>
        <p>The male hostage, David Beverly, was fatally shot in the initial minutes, the authorities said. Three hours later, the police heard another shot. They then found the gunman with a fatal gunshot to the head.</p>
        <p>NASA officials said the space center security office received a call at 1:40 p.m. that a man had shot a gun twice in Building 44, which houses communications and tracking equipment.</p>
        <p>NASA security officers, working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Houston police, surrounded the building. A SWAT team prepared to storm the building but took control of the building methodically, knowing that the gunman had barricaded himself in a second-floor office.</p>
        <p>The police shepherded employees, mostly engineers for spacecraft tracking, outside, directing them to a nearby firehouse. Operations were not interrupted elsewhere at the space center, officials said.</p>
        <p>The police tried for three hours to contact the gunman, who officials said worked for Jacobs Engineering, a subcontractor at the space center.</p>
        <p>John W. Prosser, an executive vice president for Jacobs Engineering, said, ''Our understanding is the person involved is an employee.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Prosser said he would not give more details. The police said the man was 50 to 60 years old.</p>
        <p>Building 44 has offices and a few laboratories to support tracking spacecraft like the International Space Station and the space shuttle. It is a block west of Mission Control and not far from the main gate for employees and visitors.</p>
        <p>Security at the center is not tight for employees. Metal detectors are not used. Visitors have to apply for temporary entry badges, but full-time employees and contractors bear cards that they show to guards at the gates. Except for occasional high security periods, people with hard passes come and go freely.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for NASA, Eileen Hawley, suggested that security policies would be reviewed.</p>

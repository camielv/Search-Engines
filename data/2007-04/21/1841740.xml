        <p>President Bush turned to visual aids on Friday to promote his troop buildup in Iraq, using maps and photographs on a wide electronic screen to assert that in Baghdad, ''the direction of the fight is beginning to shift.''</p>
        <p>The speech, to an audience of high school students and members of a civic group devoted to studying world affairs, was part of an intense White House public relations effort to persuade Americans -- and, more important, Democrats in Congress -- to give Mr. Bush's troop buildup a chance.

        <p>President Bush turned to visual aids on Friday to promote his troop buildup in Iraq, using maps and photographs on a wide electronic screen to assert that in Baghdad, ''the direction of the fight is beginning to shift.''</p>
        <p>The speech, to an audience of high school students and members of a civic group devoted to studying world affairs, was part of an intense White House public relations effort to persuade Americans -- and, more important, Democrats in Congress -- to give Mr. Bush's troop buildup a chance. Democrats are trying to use an Iraq war spending bill to force the president to bring troops home, and Mr. Bush has promised to veto it.</p>
        <p>On the second day of a two-day outside-the-Beltway swing, Mr. Bush laid out in his most specific terms to date what he viewed as improvements in Iraq. ''So far, the operation is meeting expectations,'' he said, at one point quoting an unnamed Middle East scholar who, Mr. Bush said, drew a contrast between ''the gloomy despair in Washington and the cautious sense of optimism in Baghdad.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush said that since the security operation began in Baghdad ''we have seen some of the highest casualties of the war,'' and his visuals included an image of one of Wednesday's bombings in Baghdad.</p>
        <p>Bombs killed at least 171 people on Wednesday in the deadliest day in the capital since before the American-led security plan for the city took effect two months ago.</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, took to the Senate floor to defend his assessment, made Thursday, that ''this war is lost,'' a comment Republicans have seized upon. ''The longer we continue down the president's path, the further we will be from responsibly ending this war,'' Mr. Reid said Friday. In Michigan, Mr. Bush chided Democrats for suggesting they had an ''alternative strategy,'' adding, ''Withdrawal is not a strategy.''</p>
        <p>Like a general outlining his battle plan, the president delivered a step-by-step analysis of the conflict in Baghdad, Anbar Province and the outskirts of Baghdad. He began with a map that used red triangles to pinpoint the location of joint security stations, posts in Baghdad where American and Iraqi forces are supposed to work to root out terrorists.</p>
        <p>''Day by day, block by block, Iraqi and American forces are making incremental gains in Baghdad,'' the president said, adding, ''Displaced families are beginning to return home. And the number of sectarian murders in Baghdad has dropped by half since the operation began.''</p>
        <p>Death squad killings have dropped by half, according to the United States military, but bombings, which have mainly been directed at Shiites, have increased in Baghdad.</p>

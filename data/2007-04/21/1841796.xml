        <p>Letters from Arthur J Lieb, Wilfred Candler, Robert Sacks, John E Colbert, Joan Magit and Molly Sword McDonough criticize Atty Gen Alberto R Gonzales in view of his testimony before Senate Judiciary Committee investigating firing of eight US attorneys; Douglas Karo says Gonzales remains same man that senators confirmed and might even be above average in Bush cabinet</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Gonzales Endures Harsh Session with Senate Panel'' (front page, April 20):</p>
        <p>As a supervisor at the Library of Congress in the late 1970s, I initiated, for cause, the firing of two employees. Nearly three decades later, I can still remember many of the details.</p>
        <p>Firing an employee is the worst experience a supervisor can have. How could our attorney general, Alberto R. Gonzales, ''forget'' so quickly? If his mismanagement of the dismissal of the federal prosecutors is not enough reason for him to step down, surely his poor memory is.</p>
        <p>Arthur J. Lieb  Boulder, Colo., April 20, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We do not need an attorney general with amnesia. Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales says he cannot recall any meetings, that is, he does not know what he said or did.</p>
        <p>Yet he declares that he ''firmly'' believes ''that nothing improper occurred.'' What is the basis for this belief? It is time for the Senate to help him out, by subpoenaing the other participants in these meetings and conversations.</p>
        <p>Wilfred Candler  Annapolis, Md., April 20, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Aren't the senators being a little disingenuous in their criticisms of Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales? He remains the same man they confirmed and might even be above average in this cabinet.</p>
        <p>If every memory- and truth-challenged good friend of this president were thought not to be right for a high government job, who would be left to serve the president and push his political interests?</p>
        <p>Douglas Karo  Durham, N.H., April 20, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Gonzales v. Gonzales'' (editorial, April 20):</p>
        <p>What does it mean in the 21st century to ''accept complete and full responsibility''? In incident after incident, politicians take ''full responsibility'' and nothing really happens.</p>
        <p>Unless I'm terribly confused, when you accept responsibility, you take the good and the bad that come with that decision and commitment. The good is the demonstration of leadership. The bad is accepting the real consequences of poor decision making (that is, resigning, getting fired or some other disciplinary action).</p>
        <p>In today's political ''speak,'' taking full responsibility means nothing more than ineffective hot air.</p>
        <p>Robert Sacks  Copake, N.Y., April 20, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The testimony of Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales reflects the character of this administration, particularly its leader: incompetent, deceptive, arrogant, shallow, agenda driven, unable to explain decisions except in self-referential terms instead of rational ones.</p>
        <p>Our release date is down to 21 months. Can we make it?</p>
        <p>John E. Colbert  Chicago, April 20, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is both embarrassing and frightening to see such a spectacle being performed before the nation and the world by Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales.</p>
        <p>He's a political hack, a crony, a ''Bushie'' without any integrity who is a stranger to the truth. I have no respect for this man, for he has put us all in jeopardy, harmed our judicial system and seems not to comprehend his destructiveness.</p>
        <p>Joan Magit  Northridge, Calif., April 20, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Dozen Questions for Alberto Gonzales'' (Op-Ed, April 19):</p>
        <p>It is time for President Bush and his administration to start displaying loyalty from the top down, instead of expecting it from the bottom up.</p>
        <p>President Bush should display his loyalty to the people of the United States of America, and not the other way around. I say this with all respect as a lifelong Republican.</p>
        <p>Molly Sword McDonough  Pennington, N.J., April 19, 2007</p>

        <p>Banksy Be Gone</p>
        <p>Workers for Transport of London, the government body responsible for the city's transport systems, have painted over a mural by Banksy, the celebrated graffiti artist, BBC News reported yesterday. The work, right, near the Old Street underground station, was taken from the film ''Pulp Fiction'' but showed the actors Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta clutching bananas rather than guns. It was one of Banksy's best-known efforts, estimated by some to be worth £300,000 ($601,000). ''People used to come from all over to see it and photograph it,'' said a barber who works nearby. ''Whoever destroyed it is an idiot,'' he added. In March most of a Banksy mural in East London was stolen, and an early work was mistakenly painted over in the city of Bristol by graffiti-removal contractors. In February two smaller works in London were also painted over. Transport for London is committed to removing graffiti, a spokesman said, because it creates a ''general atmosphere of neglect and social decay which in turn encourages crime.'' He added that ''our graffiti-removal teams are staffed by professional cleaners, not professional art critics.'' In the meantime, someone has painted the words ''Come Back'' on the wall once beloved for its Banksy.</p>
        <p>Ardant Onstage</p>
        <p>Fanny Ardant, the French actress who came to international notice in 1981 in the film ''The Woman Next Door,'' directed by François Truffaut, will make her New York stage debut on May 4 and 5 in an adaptation of ''La Maladie de la Mort'' (''The Disease of Death''), a short story by Marguerite Duras, at Gould Hall, the French Institute Alliance Française announced. In this one-woman show, Ms. Ardant plays a prostitute speaking to a man who has paid for her company but is incapable of loving or being loved. The play, produced in Paris last summer, will be presented in French, with English supertitles. The institute will also screen some of Ms. Ardant's films in May. Information: fiaf.org.</p>
        <p>Master Class</p>
        <p>Kevin Spacey will lead six workshops for 180 New York City high school students who have attended the Broadway production of ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' the Theater Development Fund announced on Thursday. The workshops, a partnership between the fund and the Old Vic Theater in London, where Mr. Spacey, right, is the artistic director, will take about 30 students from each of six schools -- Forest Hills High School, Young Women's Leadership Academy, All Hallows High School, LaGuardia High School, Edward R. Murrow High School and Stuyvesant High School -- to see the play. Mr. Spacey and several of the fund's teaching artists will lead the workshops, which will culminate in student performances of scenes from the play in their classrooms.</p>

        <p>While corporate sponsorship of outdoor theaters and concert arenas has become common, it's still a rare occurrence in the club world. But on Monday the promoter Live Nation is expected to announce that the Gramercy, the former theater on 23rd Street in Manhattan that reopened six weeks ago as a 600-capacity music club, will be renamed Blender Theater at Gramercy, as part of a multiyear agreement with Blender magazine. The new name will go on the marquee, but the magazine will not be involved with booking the club, said Lee Rosenbaum, the publisher of Blender. Last week Live Nation rechristened Irving Plaza as the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza as part of a plan to attach the Fillmore name -- after the club in San Francisco and its short-lived New York annex, which closed in 1971 -- to a series of midsize clubs around the country.</p>
        <p>Keys to the Eternal City</p>
        <p>The American Academy, an arts and humanities center in Rome, announced the winners of the 2007-8 Rome Prize on Thursday. The 30 recipients, all artists and scholars, will stay in Rome for six months to two years. Among this year's winners are the writer Junot Diaz and the choreographer Molissa Fenley. A complete list is at aarome.org.</p>
        <p>Footnote</p>
        <p>The critically acclaimed West End production of Peter Shaffer's ''Equus,'' starring Harry Po , um, Daniel Radcliffe, is inching closer to New York. Producers announced yesterday that the play, closing at the Gielgud Theater on June 9, is eyeing Broadway for next spring.</p>

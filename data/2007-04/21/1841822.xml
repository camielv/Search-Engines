        <p>BLACKBERRY users' thumbs were idle; private equity investors got a thumbs up from Sallie Mae; and a jury turned thumbs down on Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest.</p>
        <p>Sallie Mae, the nation's largest lender to students, agreed on Monday to a $25 billion buyout by two private equity firms and two banks, in the largest such deal ever involving a financial services company.</p>
        <p>The deal, by J. C. Flowers &amp; Company, Friedman Fleischer &amp; Lowe and the banks JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, showcases the growing appetite of private equity firms for deal-making.</p>
        <p>Over the last year, Sallie Mae, which holds a $142 billion loan portfolio, has faced mounting challenges as a public company. Federal and state lawmakers are closely scrutinizing the student lending industry's relationship with colleges. And both Congress and President Bush have proposed cutting the federal subsidies that have fueled Sallie Mae's 35-year growth.</p>
        <p>Once considered off limits because of their limited ability to take on debt, financial-services firms may become the newest targets in private equity's buying spree.</p>

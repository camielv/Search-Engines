        <p>Valerie Oltarsh went to work for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1994.</p>
        <p>She hadn't voted for him. Her politics were decidedly to the left of his. But when Ms. Oltarsh (now Oltarsh-McCarthy through marriage) first met with Mr. Giuliani, she liked what he had to say about immigrants.</p>
        <p>Immigration was her field back then. She had helped refugees adjust to life here while with the New York Association for New Americans, an immigrant services agency. Her interview with Mr. Giuliani was intended for him to see if she was the right person to head his Office of Immigrant Affairs. She saw it as a mutual look-see.</p>
        <p>''He convinced me,'' Ms. Oltarsh-McCarthy said, ''that he was really committed to the rights of immigrants.''</p>
        <p>That included illegal immigrants. As mayor, Mr. Giuliani ordered that they not be denied city services like schools and hospitals. He insisted that city workers not serve, in effect, as immigration agents. His policies swam against the national Republican tide.</p>
        <p>''He had a very humanistic view of immigrants, and recognized that they contribute to our society in many ways,'' said Ms. Oltarsh-McCarthy, now a psychotherapist in Manhattan. ''This was a commitment to a whole population in New York. And because he was so prominent and so vocal, he took a leadership position and a national role.''</p>
        <p>That was then. Things have changed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Oltarsh-McCarthy left the Giuliani administration in 1996 after a falling-out with senior officials. The differences, she says, were rooted in personalities and procedures, not in core principles of immigration policy. Now, from the distant sidelines, she watches with dismay at the way Mr. Giuliani is courting Republican voters in his presidential race.</p>
        <p>Where he once spoke firmly about tending even to illegal immigrants, he now puts more stress on penalizing them. Where he once talked about their contributions, he now urges tougher border controls. Where he once forbade his police force to ask a person's immigration status, he now wants illegal immigrants to be issued identity cards.</p>
        <p>Sept. 11 changed realities, the former mayor and his aides say. That much, Ms. Oltarsh-McCarthy agrees, is undeniable.</p>
        <p>''It is post-9/11,'' she said. ''But it seems to me that inherent in that assumption is that immigrants are potential criminals. He never before spoke of immigrants as criminals. It scares me that he would move to a place where people are demonized like this. He was steadfastly against the idea of people having to carry ID cards. He saw it as un-American.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's changes on immigration are not his only ones. Nor are liberals alone in unhappiness over his, ahem, evolutions. Some on the right are displeased, too. In the last couple of weeks, he has been attacked in half a dozen columns and editorials in The New York Post and The New York Sun.</p>
        <p>That says something. Those two conservative newspapers normally criticize the former mayor about as often as L'Osservatore Romano does a hatchet job on the pope. Lately, though, they have run headlines like ''Giuliani's Fiscal Flip-Flops,'' ''Giuliani's Pretzel'' and ''Rudy's Wrongs.''</p>
        <p>THE flip-flop accusation, hardly a plus for any candidate, is especially important in Mr. Giuliani's case because he presents himself as a singular anchor of principle, not someone who bends in the political winds.</p>
        <p>Yet bend he seems to have done. As mayor, he was fully for abortion rights. As a presidential candidate, he says he would appoint ''strict constructionists'' to the Supreme Court -- code, to many, for undermining Roe v. Wade.</p>
        <p>As mayor, he supported federal gun-control legislation. As a candidate, he emphasizes that states should figure out their own gun laws. (He is also a states-rights advocate these days on flying the Confederate flag.) As mayor, he said a federal flat tax ''would really be a disaster.'' As a candidate, he says it ''would make a lot of sense.''</p>
        <p>The question is when does a flip become a flop.</p>
        <p>Of course, people can change their minds, Ms. Oltarsh-McCarthy said, adding, ''It's a mark of maturity to be able to listen.'' But given the significant shifts that Candidate Giuliani seems to have made to play to the crowd, she said, ''You have to wonder.''</p>
        <p>You do. You have to wonder if Mr. Giuliani has made early Bob Dylan his muse. When he is asked about an issue like immigration or abortion, is the answer blowin' in the wind?</p>

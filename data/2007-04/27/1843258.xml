        <p>The rapper Cam'ron apologized yesterday for saying on ''60 Minutes'' that cooperating with the police would hurt his professional reputation. The comments by Cam'ron, left, whose real name is Cameron Giles, were made in an interview with Anderson Cooper for a segment last Sunday about how hip-hop stars discourage blacks from reporting crimes or helping in criminal investigations. Responding to public outcry, he called his remarks ''an error in judgment'' and said in a statement: ''I can see how those comments could be viewed as offensive, especially to those who have suffered their own personal tragedies or to those who put their lives on the line to protect our citizens from crime.'' But Cam'ron, who is from Harlem and was the victim of a shooting two years ago, added that there is a ''dark reality'' in many American cities: ''Where I come from, once word gets around that you've cooperated with the police, that only makes you a bigger target of criminal violence.''</p>

        <p>EMI Group, the struggling British music giant, has hired the longtime industry executive Roger Ames, a former chairman of Warner Music Group, to revive its North American operation.</p>
        <p>The appointment of Mr. Ames, a 57-year-old native of Trinidad, comes more than three months after a management shakeup in which EMI ousted the two senior executives overseeing its recorded music operation. Mr. Ames had been a consultant advising EMI on a range of issues for the last two years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ames will oversee the company's labels in the United States, including the Capitol Music Group and Blue Note Records, but he is almost sure to play some role in determining EMI's strategies for future deal making. As head of Warner Music in 2000 -- when it was a unit of Time Warner -- Mr. Ames tried to orchestrate a merger with EMI, but the deal collapsed amid doubts that it would receive regulatory approval.</p>
        <p>After Time Warner sold the music unit to an investor consortium led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. in 2003, Mr. Ames found himself in a diminished role, and soon left the company. Warner and EMI have talked on and off about merger or acquisition deals ever since. Most recently, talks between the two sides have been hung up on regulatory concerns.</p>
        <p>EMI's chief, Eric Nicoli, took direct control of the company's music operation in a reorganization earlier this year and remains in that role. But the hiring of Mr. Ames puts an experienced record industry executive in charge of the company's labels in the world's biggest music market.</p>
        <p>As part of the new arrangement, Ivan Gavin, EMI's chief operating officer for North America, is leaving the company.</p>
        <p>EMI, which releases music by artists including Norah Jones and Joss Stone, has long ranked last among the major record corporations in sales in the United States, though its share of the ailing market has surged to 11.6 percent so far this year, up from 9.3 percent last year, according to Nielsen SoundScan data.</p>

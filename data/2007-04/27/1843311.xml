        <p>Commissioner Bud Selig said yesterday that he believed that Marvin Miller deserved to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame, a surprising endorsement considering that Miller created the Players Association that was in protracted conflict with the owners for many years.</p>
        <p>Selig put in a word for the retired Miller as he spoke of the need for ''adjustments'' in the Hall's reconstituted veterans committee.</p>
        <p>Every two years, the committee votes on players who were not elected over a 15-year period by the Baseball Writers Association of America. Every four years, the committee considers executives, umpires and managers.</p>
        <p>However, in five ballots dating to 2003, the committee has failed to elect a single person. In the most recent results, Miller received 63 percent of the votes; 75 percent is needed.</p>
        <p>The veterans committee is controlled by the Hall of Fame, not Major League Baseball, but Selig has input as a member of the Hall's board of directors.</p>
        <p>Selig made his remarks at a meeting of the Associated Press Sports Editors in New York.</p>

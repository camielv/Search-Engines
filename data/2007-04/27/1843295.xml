        <p>The Justice Department notified Congressional investigators that it was withholding more than 170 documents on the ouster of eight United States attorneys, saying it would be inappropriate to turn over material on inquiries from members of Congress and the news media. It did provide a list of the e-mail messages it was withholding. They included exchanges last January between D. Kyle Sampson, then the attorney general's chief of staff, and Harriet E. Miers, then the White House counsel, about replacement prosecutors. The list also refers to ''talking points'' provided to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales for conversations with members of Congress.</p>

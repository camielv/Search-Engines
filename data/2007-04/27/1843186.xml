        <p>A trip on Air Force One and a talk between President Bush and Representative Charles B. Rangel as they traveled to Mr. Rangel's home district in Harlem this week has suddenly lifted prospects for bipartisan agreement on trade legislation in Congress, officials on both sides said Thursday.</p>
        <p>The officials said that negotiations had resumed between teams led by Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, and Mr. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and that a deal was in sight, clearing the way for approval of the trade legislation.</p>
        <p>''They are talking, they are making progress, and they are hopeful of wrapping this up,'' a Rangel aide said. But he said the talks could spill into next week.</p>
        <p>Aides to Ms. Schwab echoed that view, adding that the turnaround occurred after Mr. Bush and Mr. Rangel gave the two sides a nudge. Before, they were at an impasse, especially over the rights of workers.</p>
        <p>''Principals and senior staffers have been and will continue to be engaged in talks leading into next week,'' said Gretchen Hamel, a spokeswoman for Ms. Schwab.</p>
        <p>Democrats favor adding provisions calling for workers' right to organize and a ban on child labor and forced labor in the trading partner countries. The Bush administration has resisted the Democrats' proposals, charging that they constituted a backdoor attempt to change labor laws in the United States.</p>
        <p>At stake in the near term are negotiated trade deals between the Bush administration and South Korea, Panama, Peru and Colombia. All require the approval of Congress, where they face skepticism as polls show that Americans are increasingly fearful of lower trade barriers, cheap imports and job losses.</p>
        <p>Beyond these trade deals, however, the stakes could be larger if an agreement paves the way for an extension of Mr. Bush's authority to negotiate future trade deals and get an expedited vote in Congress. That authority expires June 30.</p>
        <p>If the talks are successful, they will be the first significant bipartisan accord on an economic issue since the new Congress began.</p>
        <p>They may also give impetus to the on-again, off-again negotiations over a global trade deal among more than 180 nations under the so-called Doha Round, named after the city in Qatar where talks began five years ago.</p>
        <p>Pascal Lamy, general director of the World Trade Organization, visited Washington earlier in the week and called on lawmakers to support the global trade talks, in which the United States is being asked to lower trade barriers on farm products in return for greater access overseas for its goods and services.</p>
        <p>The global trade talks have foundered over the inability of the main actors -- the United States, Europe, India and Brazil -- to agree on formulas for lowering all their barriers. An agreement among those countries could set the stage for others to follow their lead.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers say that, as a practical matter, they are not likely to take up Mr. Bush's request for renewed trade negotiating authority without progress on global trade. Even with progress, most Democrats may not support future deals. Many Democrats won elections last year by opposing trade deals under Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Prospects in trade talks with Democrats have ebbed and flowed for weeks. Only last week, Mr. Rangel said it appeared that the administration had rebuffed the Democrats' request for guarantees of labor rights.</p>
        <p>''There are some people who hate unions so much, they can't see their way clear to supporting this provision,'' he said then.</p>
        <p>But the tone changed after Mr. Bush traveled to Harlem on Tuesday, taking Mr. Rangel with him. They drove along the streets where the congressman grew up.</p>
        <p>''You can imagine what it's like traveling in the presidential limousine down Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard hearing Rangel say, 'I was raised over here, and here's the hotel I worked in when I was a boy,' '' Mr. Bush said at a charter school. ''You know, the people in Harlem have got a fantastic congressman in Charles Rangel.'' As the audience laughed, Mr. Bush said, ''He can agree with me a few more times, but I don't expect him to.''</p>
        <p>In the disagreement of the moment, Democrats have been demanding that trade deals include strict enforcement of environmental laws and even enactment of new laws by trading partner countries, as well as other provisions that would preserve some American laws that bar bidding on certain government contracts by foreign parties.</p>
        <p>But these demands have taken second place to the labor provision, in part because the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would oppose the Latin America and South Korea deals without labor protections, and many Democrats would follow their lead.</p>
        <p>The administration, backed by groups like the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce, has charged that the labor protections, as crafted by Mr. Rangel, would upend American labor laws.</p>
        <p>Specifically, they say that a country could sue to throw out state right-to-work laws, which outlaw workplaces in which employees must join unions or pay union dues. Also in jeopardy, they maintain, would be jobs for teenagers and state practices of using prisoners to make goods for sale to the public.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rangel and the Democrats say these concerns are baseless, since the labor protections would allow challenges only by foreign governments, and only for labor practices that affect international trade.</p>

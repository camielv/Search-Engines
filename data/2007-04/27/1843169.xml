        <p>Emily W. Sunstein, an independent scholar known for writing biographies of an unconventional mother and her unconventional daughter -- Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Shelley -- died on Saturday in Philadelphia. She was 82 and had lived in Philadelphia for many years.</p>
        <p>The cause was complications of autoimmune vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels, her daughter Kay Hymowitz said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sunstein's first biography, ''A Different Face: The Life of Mary Wollstonecraft,'' was published in 1975 by Harper &amp; Row. It chronicled the life of the mother, the noted British author and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-97), who died a few days after the birth of her daughter, the future Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley.</p>
        <p>Her second biography, ''Mary Shelley: Romance and Reality'' (Little, Brown, 1989), was the story of the daughter (1797-1851) who wrote ''Frankenstein'' and was the wife of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.</p>
        <p>Reviewing the Mary Shelley biography in The New York Times Book Review, Carolyn Heilbrun wrote: ''Ms. Sunstein has corrected the erroneous assumptions that have misled so many critics, myself (when young) included.'' She added: ''Ms. Sunstein is to be praised for looking anew at so misunderstood a life.''</p>
        <p>In 1989 Ms. Sunstein's Mary Shelley biography was awarded the Modern Language Association Prize for Independent Scholars.</p>
        <p>Emily Weisberg was born on April 28, 1924, in Dallas, and was reared there. In 1944 she earned a bachelor's degree in art history from Vassar College.</p>
        <p>Before beginning her writing career, Ms. Sunstein was active in civic affairs. A charter member of Americans for Democratic Action, founded in 1947, she later became the first woman to serve as head of the Philadelphia chapter of the American Jewish Committee.</p>
        <p>Besides her daughter Kay, of Brooklyn, Ms. Sunstein is survived by her husband, Leon C. Sunstein Jr., whom she married in 1943; a son, Paul, of Ann Arbor, Mich.; another daughter, Lauren Sunstein, of Rome; and six grandchildren.</p>

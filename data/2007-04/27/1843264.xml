        <p>Opens today in Manhattan  Directed by Heidi Specogna  In Spanish, English and German, with English subtitles  Not rated; 89 minutes</p>
        <p>Lance Cpl. José Antonio Gutiérrez, the subject of this nonfiction film, was a Guatemalan immigrant who became the first American soldier killed in the invasion of Iraq. Official accounts presented a classic tale of an up-by-your-bootstraps immigrant -- a young man who fled poverty and violence in his native land, then enlisted in the Marines in hopes of earning his green card more quickly.</p>
        <p>That description was correct, but only to a point. Directed by Heidi Specogna, ''The Short Life of José Antonio Gutiérrez'' bypasses the official narrative and builds a new one that's more complex and less flattering to America's self-creation myths. The chaos that displaced the Gutiérrez family and eventually set him on a path through Mexico and the United States was itself a byproduct of American intervention in Guatemalan politics. The Lance Corporal Gutiérrez depicted by Ms. Specogna was a troubled young man who hid his sensitivity behind a street hustler's stony facade, and his death was probably the result of friendly fire.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Specogna's film fleshes out his life to the extent that it can -- leaning heavily on still photographs and interviewing loved ones, social workers and fellow Marines -- the portrait remains frustratingly incomplete. But given its larger subject -- a young life trampled beneath history's forward march -- this seems entirely fitting.</p>

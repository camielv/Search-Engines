        <p>How do you investigate a crime against music? According to Bruce Adolphe, you hire a private ear.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Adolphe, director of family programs for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, this conceit is more than a joke that you might see printed on the back of a cereal box. It is the basis for ''Sherlock Key Meets Claude Debussy,'' a concert production that will have its world premiere on Sunday. As Mr. Adolphe explains it, Debussy was such an innovator that many critics in his period misunderstood or disliked his work.</p>

        <p>How do you investigate a crime against music? According to Bruce Adolphe, you hire a private ear.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Adolphe, director of family programs for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, this conceit is more than a joke that you might see printed on the back of a cereal box. It is the basis for ''Sherlock Key Meets Claude Debussy,'' a concert production that will have its world premiere on Sunday. As Mr. Adolphe explains it, Debussy was such an innovator that many critics in his period misunderstood or disliked his work.</p>
        <p>''One of my favorite comments was that he was 'an anarchist of music,' which appeared in 1902 in a French newspaper,'' Mr. Adolphe said. The image of Debussy as the Sacco or Vanzetti of the classical world inspired this hourlong concert, the season's last in the Meet the Music! series for children 6 to 10.</p>
        <p>''In the show Debussy is arrested by the music police,'' Mr. Adolphe said. But in steps the eminent private ear Sherlock Key, who takes up Debussy's cause. Most of the concert consists of the trial, in which the musicians portray witnesses and the audience plays the jury.</p>
        <p>The other stars include, above from left, the pianist Gilles Vonsattel; Katja Stroke-Adolphe, Mr. Adolphe's 8-year-old daughter, as the judge; and Mr. Adolphe himself, who, with the help of props and funny accents, incarnates Debussy, Sherlock and Dr. Whatsound (Sherlock's sidekick). The Daedalus Quartet, here disguised as the Baguette Quartet, will present testimony with Mr. Vonsattel: not only Debussy's works, but also a few contemporary tunes done in the Debussy style. The point is to show that the unusual music had an internal order.</p>
        <p>''We're actually going to sing one of his exotic scales,'' Mr. Adolphe said, ''and I'm going to teach some of the harmony and get the audience to sing it too.'' Mr. Adolphe will ask these jurors to vote, confident of their support.</p>
        <p>And if they find Debussy guilty?</p>
        <p>''Then,'' Mr. Adolphe said, ''Sherlock Key will keep the case going until they change their minds.'' (Sunday at 1 and 3 p.m. at Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, 212-875-5788; $15.)</p>

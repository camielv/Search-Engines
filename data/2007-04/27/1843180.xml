        <p>The potential risk to humans who might have eaten meat contaminated with melamine is extremely low, and the Food and Drug Administration believes that only 6,000 hogs may have eaten the reconstituted feed.</p>
        <p>But concern has shifted to encompass melamine-related compounds that include cyanuric acid, which can be used as a pool cleaner, and mixed with melamine could cause crystal formations that damage kidneys and could in some cases cause the organ to fail, an F.D.A. official said.</p>
        <p>Melamine, a compound used to make plastic utensils and as a fertilizer in some countries, has been found in wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate that came from two Chinese suppliers starting as far back as July 2006.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, a new recall was issued for food containing rice protein concentrate, said David Elder, the director of enforcement in the Office of Regulatory Affairs at the F.D.A. More than 100 pet foods have been recalled since March.</p>
        <p>The majority of the 6,000 hogs thought to have eaten the contaminated product are still on the farms where they were raised, but the Department of Agriculture is still tracking down products from 345 hogs: 50 from a custom slaughterhouse in California that cannot be sold in retail, 195 from a farm in Kansas that were sent to a facility in Nebraska, and no more than 100 hogs from the processing plant in Utah, said Nicol Andrews, a spokeswoman for the department. It is not known if any of these hogs were eaten, she said.</p>
        <p>Pork producers in California, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina and Utah are being investigated, and Oklahoma has been added to the list. It has been determined that the feed sent to Ohio predated the tainted food, and that state has been taken off the list. Swine that ate the adulterated product will be euthanized and farmers compensated for the animals. A feed mill in Missouri is still being investigated, Ms. Andrews said.</p>
        <p>China, it was reported Thursday, has banned the use of melamine in food. The F.D.A. is preparing to send investigators to the country to track down the source of the melamine.</p>

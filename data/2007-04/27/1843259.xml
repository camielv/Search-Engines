        <p>Boasting celebrity guests like Bono, Il Divo and Jack Black, Day 2 of the ''Idol Gives Back'' charity edition of ''American Idol'' was commanding as usual in the ratings. Fox garnered more viewers than ABC, NBC, CBS and the CW combined as the two-hour telethon attracted an average of 26.4 million viewers from 8 to 10 p.m., increasing in every half hour, according to Nielsen's estimates. In a twist, the ''Idol'' host Ryan Seacrest announced that the night's generosity would extend to the contestants: the six remaining finalists were granted a one-week reprieve. However, the 70 million votes cast this week will be counted in next week's scoring when two contestants will face elimination. Mr. Seacrest also announced that, as of Wednesday night, the special had already raised $30 million. In the 10 p.m. hour, ABC's ''Lost'' (11.6 million) edged out CBS's ''CSI: NY'' (11.2 million). Although ratings for ''Lost'' remain down, it still posted the night's second-highest numbers among adults 18 to 49, propelling ABC to second place for the night in that demographic, even as CBS drew more total viewers.</p>

        <p>These married musicians, above, who are opening an extended engagement at the Café Carlyle on Tuesday, have been called the ''Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim; Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross; Dave Frishberg; and Paul Simon join hands. Mr. Pizzarelli is a whiz kid on the jazz guitar, an amiable crooner and stand-up clown and mimic whose musical chops are matched by his onstage charm. Though Ms. Molaskey comes out of theater and semiclassical art song, she swings, and her happy-sad voice is an exquisitely expressive instrument. So deep is her psychological insight into lyrics that you might describe her as a pop intellectual, but her interpretations have a lightness and ease that make them almost tossed off. When Mr. Pizzarelli accompanies her on guitar and vocals, supplying witty musical quotations and spontaneous comic shtick, their repartee suggests a dialogue between contemporary Noël Coward characters. Both have new albums. Mr. Pizzarelli's ''Dear Mr. Sinatra'' (Telarc) is a big-band record in which he emphasizes the sunny side of Ol' Blue Eyes. The songs on Ms. Molaskey's ''Sitting in Limbo'' (PS Classics), produced by Mr. Pizzarelli and to be released on May 8, portray relationships and modern American life as a bipolar roller-coaster. It is a profound pop-jazz album that connects traditional American pop with the present in a way that has never been done before. (Tuesdays through Thursdays at 8:45 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays at 8:45 and 10:45 p.m., through May 26, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 and $125 Tuesday through Thursday; $85 Friday and Saturday. Mr. Pizzarelli is also performing tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 at Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $40 and $50).</p>

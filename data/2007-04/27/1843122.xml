        <p>In his continuing effort to find new ways to get people to listen to old jazz, Wynton Marsalis has put together these concerts by the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which look at the repertory through the lens of a record label known for meticulous recordings and distinctive album covers. Mr. Marsalis and several other orchestra members have done big-band arrangements of some of their favorite Blue Note recordings. The choices are mostly from the label's hard-bop heyday, including pieces by Jackie McLean, Lee Morgan, Bud Powell and Horace Silver, and the hope is that the audience will happily recognize them. ''These are the songs that taught us jazz music,'' said the trombonist Vincent R. Gardner, who did the arrangements for Herbie Hancock's ''Maiden Voyage'' and Kenny Dorham's ''Trompeta Toccata.'' ''They're the ones that have touched us the most, and will touch them the most.'' (Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, 212-721-6500 or jalc.org; $30 to $120.)</p>

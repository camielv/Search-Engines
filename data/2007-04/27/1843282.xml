        <p>The police found the bodies of a 25-year-old Sunni man and a 12-year-old Sunni boy whose abduction on Monday had already prompted concerns of rising sectarian tensions. The bodies were found in a field southeast of Beirut after an anonymous call to a television station. Their families are members of the pro-government party of the Druse leader Walid Jumblatt, an opponent of Hezbollah, the militant Shiite organization. Local reports said the two were kidnapped by members of a Shiite clan to avenge the killing of a relative in January. Mr. Jumblatt appealed for calm.</p>

        <p>Two of the world's most repressive nations, Myanmar and North Korea, restored diplomatic relations after more than two decades of estrangement. The agreement was signed without fanfare during a three-day visit to Myanmar, formerly Burma, by Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Yong-il of North Korea. Myanmar's deputy foreign minister, Kyaw Thu, said it would be up to the North Koreans to decide whether to open a diplomatic mission in the remote new capital, Naypyidaw, 200 miles north of Yangon, the largest city and former capital. Relations between the nations have been quietly warming over recent years as both sought allies under pressure from the West.</p>

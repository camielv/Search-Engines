        <p>Jonathan Lasker's system seems to be working. For nearly 30 years he has pursued his born-again, refried formalism, using a strictly limited vocabulary without painting himself into a corner. His current exhibition of starkly frontal, what-you-see-is-what-you-see canvases is possibly the best of his career.</p>

        <p>Cheim &amp; Read  547 West 25th Street, Chelsea  Through May 5</p>
        <p>Jonathan Lasker's system seems to be working. For nearly 30 years he has pursued his born-again, refried formalism, using a strictly limited vocabulary without painting himself into a corner. His current exhibition of starkly frontal, what-you-see-is-what-you-see canvases is possibly the best of his career.</p>
        <p>The new paintings are calmer and more attentive and anchored to their rectangles, which they fill in orderly, squared-off fashion, with no loss of brute, fingernails-to-the-blackboard garishness. They layer and juxtapose a more sharply differentiated potpourri of grid-based networks, enlarged calligraphic episodes, sharp and round-shouldered shapes -- all conveyed in contrasting paint thicknesses and techniques and a palette of bright monochromes, interlaced primaries and black.</p>
        <p>Off-kilter spontaneity alternates with careful premeditation, as a series of preparatory drawings nearly identical to the final product attests. And flat-footed immediacy is leavened with historical allusion. Cartoons, graffiti, Pollock's skeins, Ryman's methodical brushwork, African sculpture (and Tony Smith's sculpture), weaving, Guston's early crosshatches as well as his big late heads are just some of the references at work here.</p>
        <p>The results are latter-day specific objects. The strongest are three paintings whose thick, midsize networks are overlaid with a burly black hieroglyph (or two, as in ''A Portrait of the Artist's Mother''). In others that may be coming up the outside track, more delicate scribbles and blocky shapes bring to mind the circuitry and cell-like squares of Peter Halley, whose own play-dead painting has paralleled Mr. Lasker's from the start. With the upward spike in abstract painting right now, a Lasker survey might do New York some good.</p>

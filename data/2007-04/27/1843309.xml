        <p>City health officials warned yesterday that some brands of imported eye makeup contain high levels of lead and could pose a health hazard to users. The products, which are called kohl, kajal and surma, often do not have a list of ingredients on the package, officials said. Sara Markt, a health department spokeswoman, said consumers should not buy products if they are uncertain about the content. Among the products the city found to contain lead are Hashmi Surma Special, Hashmi Kajal and Hashmi Kohl Aswad, all made in Pakistan, and Pure Kohl From the Waters of ZamZam. ''You should be looking for some sign that the product is approved, or there are listed ingredients,'' she said. Officials issued the warning after investigating several recent cases of children and pregnant women reporting lead poisoning, she said.</p>

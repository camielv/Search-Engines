        <p>THE BENT FESTIVAL  (Tomorrow) Children sometimes enjoy breaking toys almost as much as playing with them. This festival, presented by the Tank, is all about short-circuiting battery-powered playthings to create electronic instruments. Two workshops are suitable for children: ''Intro to Circuit-Bending,'' at 11 a.m. (take sound-making toys and batteries), and ''Introduction Into the Giant Chaotic Circuit-Bending Merzbau Jungle,'' at 2 p.m., an interactive exploration of the artist Andreas Stoiber's electronic installation. At Eyebeam Atelier, 540 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 563-6269, bentfestival.org; free.</p>
        <p>'BUG BOY BLUES' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Kafka for kids? That's the idea behind this show, which explores the mind of young Gregor Samsa, subject of ''The Metamorphosis.'' It also includes non-Kafkaesque elements, like a jam band and dancing insects. (Through June 3.) Tomorrow at noon and 2 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 4 p.m., the Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; $12; $10 for 12 and under.</p>
        <p>CROSS-GENERATION CHESS (Sunday) The chessboard is common ground in this monthly program, which brings together children from kindergarten through high school with elderly adults. Players of any level are invited for games, live classical music and, most important, conversation. Lunch is free. From 2 to 5:30 p.m., the Chelsea Recreation Center, 430 West 25th Street. Registration (optional): (917) 822-3141, crossgenerationchess.com; free.</p>
        <p>'A DOLPHIN UP A TREE!' (Sunday) A little magic can be a dangerous thing. In this musical a girl casts a spell that brings her stuffed toys to life and turns her into the creature of the title. At 11 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444; $15.</p>
        <p>'EVERYTHING ABOUT SCHOOL (ALMOST)' (Tonight through Sunday) This musical, revived by Tada!, humorously underscores that the bossy, self-dramatizing second grader usually turns into a bossy, self-dramatizing teenager, and that the boy who teases a girl in seventh grade often swoons at her feet later. (Through May 13.) Tonight at 7, tomorrow and Sunday at 2 and 4 p.m., Tada! Theater, 15 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 252-1619, Ext. 28; $18; $8 for 15 and under. Tonight only, buy a ticket and receive one free.</p>
        <p>'FINDING PEACE' (Tomorrow) Peace, in all its elusive forms, will be explored in this reading for teenagers, part of PEN World Voices: the New York Festival for International Literature. Isabel Hoving of the Netherlands, Rita Williams-Garcia of the United States and Markus Zusak of Australia will participate. At 1 p.m., the Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, Ext. 344; pen.org/festival. Free with museum admission: $10; $7 for students and 65+.</p>
        <p>FLEECE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow and Sunday) Everyone is shedding layers in the warm weather, and the Prospect Park Zoo's sheep and alpacas are to follow suit. Visitors can watch the shearing, attend zookeeper and artisan demonstrations and even dye a little wool. Noon to 4 p.m., 450 Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 399-7339, prospectparkzoo.com. Free with admission: $6; $2.25 for 65+; $1 for 3 to 12; under 3, free.</p>
        <p>'THE GREATEST LITTLE CIRCUS ON STRINGS' (Sunday) There will be more than one kind of string in this concert at the 92nd Street Y, presented by the cellist Steven Isserlis, the actor Samuel West and guest musicians. Marionettes from the Bob Brown Puppets will perform the title piece, to Siebert's Dance Suite for Cello and Piano, and play creatures in Saint-SaÃ«ns's ''Carnival of the Animals.'' At 3 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org/concerts; $16.</p>
        <p>'HOOFERS ON PARADE' (Tonight through Sunday) Busby Berkeley's 1930s films were the inspiration for this musical, a collaboration between the youth theater company Downtown Art and the Nature Theater of Oklahoma. Expect lots of toe-tapping. (Through May 20.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2 p.m, Downtown Art, 61 East Fourth Street, sixth floor, East Village, (212) 479-0885; $8; $5 for students.</p>
        <p>KIDS 'N COMEDY (Sunday) The class clown gets applause, not detention, at this series, in which comics 11 and older perform stand-up. (Don't worry; the material is clean.) At 1 p.m., Gotham Comedy Club, 208 West 23rd Street, Chelsea; $15 with a one-soda minimum. Reservations required: (212) 877-6115.</p>
        <p>KITEFLIGHT: SKYSCRAPERS (Sunday) Imaginations will soar at this workshop to build and fly kites at Socrates Sculpture Park, sponsored by the park and the Noguchi Museum. Children will use the Manhattan skyline as inspiration. From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., rain or shine, Broadway and Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 956-1819; socratessculpturepark.org; free.</p>
        <p>'MISS NELSON HAS A FIELD DAY' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Miss Nelson, that sweet teacher, and Viola Swamp, the stern substitute who suspiciously resembles her, are back in another musical based on the books by Harry Allard and James Marshall. (Through May 20.) At noon and 2 p.m., Manhattan Children's Theater, 52 White Street, near Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; $15.</p>
        <p>'ONCE UPON A PANDORA'S BOX' (Tonight through Sunday) The Greek myth has been adapted into a play, presented by the New Acting Company, in which a sister and brother discover a mysterious box in their New York apartment. (Through May 6.) Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., the Philip Coltoff Center, 219 Sullivan Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; $15 in advance; $18 at the door.</p>
        <p>PEARSONWIDRIG DANCE THEATER (Tomorrow) New Orleans and Guatemela will be among the places visited in this playful company's family matinee. At the end all audience members will be invited onstage to dance. At 2 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $15.</p>

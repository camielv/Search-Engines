        <p>Iranian and European officials said progress had been made in talks on Iran's nuclear program but said they had fallen short of the breakthrough needed to restart formal negotiations. ''We have not made miracles, but we have tried to move the dossier forward a little bit,'' Javier Solana, left, the foreign policy chief for the European Union, said in Ankara, Turkey, at the end of two days of talks with Iran's negotiator, Ali Larijani. ''The fact that we are again together, I think it's in itself a very important development.'' Mr. Larijani had hinted that the Europeans seemed to be offering a new formula for conditions for talks to resume, but a spokeswoman for Mr. Solana said no new offers were on the table. On CNN Turk, Mr. Larijani said: ''There were new ideas rising up. These ideas need time to grow and develop. But you can say this was a good first step.'' The two agreed to meet again in two weeks.</p>

        <p>8 P.M. (TCM) ALL THE KING'S MEN (1949) Turner Classic Movies presents two dramas written and directed by Robert Rossen, starting with this adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the rise and fall of a rural politician in the 1930s South. At the Oscars, the film was named best picture and Broderick Crawford, above, best actor for his portrayal of Willie Stark, a rural idealist turned corrupt -- if popular -- governor, a role seemingly inspired by Huey P. Long, the former governor and senator from Louisiana (a connection Warren denied). ''All the King's Men'' was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry after the Library of Congress deemed it culturally significant in 2001. At 10, Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason sidle up to the pool table in ''The Hustler'' (1961), the tale of Fast Eddie Felson, a small-time hustler with a self-destructive streak who challenges Minnesota Fats to a world championship match. George C. Scott plays the gambler with his money on Fats; Piper Laurie is Sarah, the wilted flower with eyes only for Eddie.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CBS) GHOST WHISPERER -- There's another ghost whisperer in town. Is she a friend, or something worse?</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CMT) THE ULTIMATE COYOTE UGLY SEARCH -- The would-be bartenders belly up to the boot camp to learn four choreographed dances and take lessons in mixing drinks. Afterward, Lil Lovell sizes them up on a scale of one to five.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (CBS) CLOSE TO HOME -- While prosecuting a drug dealer for the murder of a cop, Annabeth stumbles into the world of police corruption in this three-episode story line. Jonathan Silverman and Eric Stoltz guest star.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (NBC) RAINES -- Dig deep: Raines (Jeff Goldblum, right) has to do some soul searching after his ex-wife (Cynthia Watros in a guest role) convinces him that her latest husband's death was not an accident in this season finale. Madeleine Stowe plays the therapist he pours his heart out to.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13) BILL MOYERS JOURNAL -- Mr. Moyers moves his new show into its regular Friday time slot with interviews and analysis of politics, arts and culture, the economy and democracy.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TLC) WHAT NOT TO WEAR -- Bonnie is a 42-year-old mother who wants to do it all, which apparently leaves her with too little time to dress properly in the morning. Stacy London and Clinton Kelly show her that pajamas are not round-the-clock attire.</p>
        <p>11 P.M. (Showtime) AWESOME (2006) Adam Yauch of the punk-rap act the Beastie Boys, left, who uses the nom de plume Nathaniel Hörnblowér for filmmaking purposes, handed 50 audience members camcorders at a 2004 concert at Madison Square Garden and asked them to shoot away. The result is this documentary in all its ''primitive, kaleidoscopic glory,'' wrote Lorne Manly in The New York Times.</p>

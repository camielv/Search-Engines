        <p>Opens today in New York and selected cities  Directed by Betsy Blankenbaker  Not rated; 64 minutes.</p>
        <p>Short, sweet and sentimental, ''Something to Cheer About'' tells the story of Indiana's Crispus Attucks Tigers, who, in 1955, became the first all-black high school basketball team to win a state championship. Like last year's ''Glory Road,'' Betsy Blankenbaker's documentary celebrates a victory over much more than just rival teams.</p>
        <p>Between grainy clips of game film, original team members like the legendary Oscar Robertson, a producer of the film, and the former Harlem Globetrotter Hallie Bryant recall a time when basketball was their release from poverty and segregation. The team's unusually athletic playing style soon drew crowds of 10,000 and more while confounding its white opponents -- who were eager to split the gate but not so eager to socialize afterward. A trickier problem was the racism of many white officials. ''We always believed we could beat any team that we played against,'' says the former player Stan Patton. ''The only two people we had to beat were the referees.''</p>
        <p>Plodding but heartfelt, ''Something to Cheer About'' pays tribute to a time when basketball scholarships and professional opportunities were practically unknown. Back then, a player's only opportunity was to make history.</p>

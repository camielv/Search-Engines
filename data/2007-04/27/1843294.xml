        <p>A 1913 nickel, the best specimen of only five that are known, was bought on Wednesday by an anonymous collector in California for $5 million, said Ronald J. Gillio, the dealer who arranged the sale. It is the second-highest price ever paid for a single coin, after the $7.59 million paid for a 1933 $20 gold piece in 2002. The 1913 nickel, with the head of Liberty on one side and a large V on the reverse, once belonged to the financier Louis Eliasberg, the only person known to have assembled a complete collection of every United States coin by date and mint mark.</p>

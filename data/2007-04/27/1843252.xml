        <p>Investigations by lawmakers into the student loan industry expanded yesterday as Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House education committee, sent a letter to the inspector general of the Education Department asking for a review of the department's policies against conflicts of interest and the financial disclosure forms of employees overseeing the federal loan program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller's letter follows one sent Wednesday by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate education committee, asking for ''complete personnel files'' for 27 department employees.</p>

        <p>Investigations by lawmakers into the student loan industry expanded yesterday as Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House education committee, sent a letter to the inspector general of the Education Department asking for a review of the department's policies against conflicts of interest and the financial disclosure forms of employees overseeing the federal loan program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller's letter follows one sent Wednesday by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate education committee, asking for ''complete personnel files'' for 27 department employees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy has also begun to explore how student loan companies collect repayment.</p>
        <p>In a letter, he said that two large lenders, Sallie Mae and Nelnet, may have made harassing phone calls to borrowers; tried to collect from elderly or disabled borrowers; and refused to negotiate with borrowers on repayment deferrals, among other tactics.</p>
        <p>Tom Joyce, a spokesman for Sallie Mae, said that the company would cooperate with Mr. Kennedy's investigation but criticized it for being conducted ''through press releases.''</p>
        <p>A Nelnet spokesman, Ben Kiser, said that the company was reviewing Mr. Kennedy's letter and that it would cooperate.</p>

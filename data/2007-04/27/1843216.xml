        <p>President Bush declared parts of New Jersey a federal disaster area yesterday as a result of heavy rain and flooding almost two weeks ago. The designation will enable flood victims to apply for grants for temporary housing and home repairs as well as for low-cost loans to cover uninsured losses.</p>
        <p>Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey had requested that the entire state be declared a federal disaster area, but for now the aid will be available only in six counties -- Bergen, Burlington, Essex, Passaic, Somerset and Union. Mr. Codey estimated that New Jersey sustained $180 million in damage from the rain on April 15 and 16, which left 40,000 people without power and forced 3,000 people from their homes.</p>

        <p>President Bush declared parts of New Jersey a federal disaster area yesterday as a result of heavy rain and flooding almost two weeks ago. The designation will enable flood victims to apply for grants for temporary housing and home repairs as well as for low-cost loans to cover uninsured losses.</p>
        <p>Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey had requested that the entire state be declared a federal disaster area, but for now the aid will be available only in six counties -- Bergen, Burlington, Essex, Passaic, Somerset and Union. Mr. Codey estimated that New Jersey sustained $180 million in damage from the rain on April 15 and 16, which left 40,000 people without power and forced 3,000 people from their homes.</p>
        <p>According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, more counties may become eligible for federal disaster relief after damage surveys are completed, and aid may become available for government facilities damaged by the storm.</p>
        <p>''In the near future, we expect that as we complete the remaining assessments, there will be additional counties designated,'' Mr. Codey said.</p>
        <p>''We intend to continue working with FEMA to push for a statewide disaster declaration so that we can ensure that all New Jerseyans who are in need receive assistance as quickly as possible,'' he added.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the president designated as disaster areas three counties in New York that were affected by the same storm -- Orange, Rockland and Westchester.</p>
        <p>Mayor Angelo Corradino of Manville, in Somerset County, called yesterday's declaration ''a godsend.''</p>
        <p>''We wouldn't have survived if we didn't have it,'' Mayor Corradino said, noting that 600 of the 10,400 homes in the borough were damaged. ''Spirits are good, but with the president declaring a disaster area, that will lift their spirits even more.''</p>
        <p>Residents and business owners in the six designated counties who sustained flood damage can register for assistance at www.fema.gov or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (1-800-621-3362).</p>

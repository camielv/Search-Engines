        <p>The judge asked the lawyer for New York City a hypothetical question: If a police officer used a video camera to record a political group that he had no reason to believe was breaking the law, was it a violation of Police Department rules? Yes or no?</p>
        <p>The lawyer thought a moment, then replied, ''Can I say that's a trick question?''</p>

        <p>The judge asked the lawyer for New York City a hypothetical question: If a police officer used a video camera to record a political group that he had no reason to believe was breaking the law, was it a violation of Police Department rules? Yes or no?</p>
        <p>The lawyer thought a moment, then replied, ''Can I say that's a trick question?''</p>
        <p>The short exchange yesterday at a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan captured the flavor of the legal issues and broad moral questions that co-exist at the heart of what has come to be known as the Handschu case. First filed 36 years ago as a class-action lawsuit by a lawyer named Barbara Handschu, the case is one of the most important -- and certainly longest-lived -- federal disputes that have sought to balance the citizenry's right to political expression with the police's interest in keeping public order.</p>
        <p>Strictly speaking, little happened at yesterday's hearing, in which lawyers for the city asked a federal judge, Charles S. Haight Jr., to reconsider his sweeping order from February that compelled the Police Department to stop routine videotaping of public gatherings. The judge made no decision on the city's request, and most of the arguments on both sides were reiterations of positions made in filings to the court.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the hearing returned the issue of police surveillance to the public eye, and in so doing suggested that many of the same questions that existed in the era when the suit was first filed -- a time of groups like the Black Panthers and Vietnam Veterans Against the War -- still exist.</p>
        <p>Gail Donoghue, special counsel for the city's Law Department, began the hearing by telling Judge Haight that he overstepped his judicial powers in February when he essentially made his own court the enforcer for police guidelines that govern the investigation of political activity. Ms. Donoghue said that by making the court the final arbiter of police surveillance issues, the judge had in fact begun to ''oversee operations of the Intelligence Division of the Police Department.''</p>
        <p>The guidelines were established in 1985 under a settlement in the Handschu case and include provisions that forbid the police from investigating political groups unless it is believed that some sort of unlawful activity is under way -- in which situation the police must apply for permission to the deputy police commissioner in charge of the Intelligence Division. The guidelines have restricted techniques that the department may use in monitoring people involved in everything from antiwar demonstrations to rides by the bicycle group Critical Mass.</p>
        <p>The current dispute arises from the fact that after the Sept. 11 terror attack the city asked the judge to relax the guidelines and allow more leeway to investigate political groups. While Judge Haight agreed to a somewhat milder set of guidelines, he later gave them teeth by ruling that his court could hold in contempt any police official who violated the rules.</p>
        <p>Ms. Donoghue said she found the ruling legally dubious; she also said that if the judge remained the sole authority to enforce the guidelines, his court would soon be inundated with ''minitrial after minitrial.''</p>
        <p>Speaking for the plaintiffs, Jethro M. Eisenstein said that Judge Haight did -- and should -- have the authority to enforce the guidelines as well to punish any officials who disobeyed them. He suggested that the city, in trying to vacate Judge Haight's power, was attempting to make the guidelines ''window dressing'' and not restrictive in any way.</p>
        <p>While there was much complex legal discussion, the heart of the case was plain. Mr. Eisenstein and his colleagues said there must be safeguards in place when the police seek to investigate political groups. Ms. Donoghue said that the police did not go snooping around capriciously but tried to keep the peace.</p>
        <p>''The Police Department has no interest in people's First Amendment activity,'' she said. ''When the Police Department polices public demonstrations, their concern is public disorder and public disorder alone.''</p>

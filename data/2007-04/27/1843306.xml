      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of art review April 20 about Althea Thauberger exhibit; she is Canadian; eight young German men shown in videoparticipated as part of their social service in lieu of military obligation</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A brief art review in Weekend last Friday about an exhibition by Althea Thauberger, at John Connelly Presents in Chelsea, misidentified Ms. Thauberger's nationality. She is Canadian, not German. The review also referred incorrectly to the participation of eight young German men in a DVD that is the exhibition's centerpiece. The participation by the men, who are contributing social service in lieu of military service, does in fact count as part of that social service. The review also misstated the length of the military service that is being replaced with social service. It is nine months, not seven months.</p>

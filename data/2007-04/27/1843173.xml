        <p>A vote in the New Hampshire Senate on Thursday cleared the way for the state to become the fourth to allow civil unions for same-sex couples, and the first to do so without a court order or a pending lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The Senate voted along party lines, 14 Democrats in favor and 10 Republicans against, passing a bill that gives couples in civil unions the same rights and benefits as married couples, and that recognizes legal same-sex marriages from other states or countries as civil unions.</p>

        <p>A vote in the New Hampshire Senate on Thursday cleared the way for the state to become the fourth to allow civil unions for same-sex couples, and the first to do so without a court order or a pending lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The Senate voted along party lines, 14 Democrats in favor and 10 Republicans against, passing a bill that gives couples in civil unions the same rights and benefits as married couples, and that recognizes legal same-sex marriages from other states or countries as civil unions.</p>
        <p>Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, said last week that he would sign the bill, saying it was a matter of promoting fairness and preventing discrimination. The bill passed the New Hampshire House this month. Its passage reflects a sea change in New Hampshire politics, which in 2006 elected Democratic majorities in both state chambers for the first time in more than a century.</p>
        <p>''It's a bill dealing with fairness and equality, and it also sends a strong message that discrimination will not be the policy of the state,'' said Senator Joseph A. Foster, a Democrat. ''We did not do it as result of some court someplace telling us to do so, but we did so because it's the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Foster said being a neighbor to Vermont, which has had civil unions for seven years, had convinced him that ''what civil unions do is it affects same-gendered couples who are in committed relationships, but I haven't seen any evidence that it affects anybody else.''</p>
        <p>Senator Robert Letourneau, a Republican, said opposing civil unions was not discriminatory.</p>
        <p>''We do put limits on what we allow in the state as far as other things,'' Mr. Letourneau said. ''You cannot marry your cousins; we don't let blind people drive; we don't let felons vote. I wasn't allowed to join the service because I had punctured eardrums. Was I discriminated against?''</p>
        <p>He said the law would be ''opening up a Pandora's box'' of repercussions, including pressures on schools to teach about gay men and lesbians, problems for businesses in providing benefits to same-sex couples and violations of the military's ''don't ask don't tell'' policy, because ''if you engage in a civil union it will be public record, and everybody will know because you told.''</p>
        <p>In addition to Vermont, Connecticut and New Jersey allow civil unions. Massachusetts is the only state that allows same-sex marriage. But New York's governor, Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, said this week that he planned to introduce legislation to allow same-sex couples to marry.</p>

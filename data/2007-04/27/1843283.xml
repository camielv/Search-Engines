        <p>The army said it was reviewing its decision to allow Prince Harry, the younger son of Prince Charles and the third in line for the throne, to serve with his army unit in Iraq. ''Prince Harry's deployment to Iraq is, as we've always said, under constant consideration,'' a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defense said. But, she added, ''it is still our intent that Harry will deploy as a troop leader.'' British news outlets have reported that the Defense Ministry has grown increasingly nervous about the security implications of such a move. Eleven British soldiers have been killed in Iraq in the past month, including two whose armored reconnaissance vehicle -- the same kind Harry would be using -- was hit by a roadside bomb.</p>

        <p>Ford Motor Company executives said Thursday that a smaller loss in the first quarter was proof that their corporate overhaul was working.</p>
        <p>They were buoyed as well by strong results overseas, and the reduction of hundreds of millions of dollars in operating costs under the plan they call the Way Forward.</p>
        <p>''We're at the very early stages of a very significant business turnaround,'' the chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said.</p>
        <p>But the quarter's results were also proof that Ford's main problem -- lagging sales in the North American market -- continued to worsen. Its loss grew by 40 percent, to $614 million, from the loss in 2006.</p>
        <p>The primary reason for the deepening loss was that Ford built and sold fewer high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. Those vehicles still dominate Ford's lineup, even though the company is focusing more attention on crossover vehicles like the Edge, introduced in December, and on its cars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulally preferred to take a broader view: over all, Ford's first-quarter loss fell to $282 million from $1.4 billion in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Although it was the seventh consecutive quarterly loss, the company said that it earned a record $402 million at its Premier Automotive Group, a collection of luxury marques including Jaguar and Land Rover. Ford was profitable in Europe, too, where its car lineup is selling well.</p>
        <p>''This is not just about North America,'' Mr. Mulally said. ''North America is very important, but we have a global portfolio.''</p>
        <p>His main task, though, according to analysts, remains repairing Ford's core business, the focus of an overhaul effort for more than 15 months.</p>
        <p>''North America is what got them in the fix they're in now,'' said Robert Schulz of Standard &amp; Poor's. ''Given that, the rest of the world doesn't matter.''</p>
        <p>And Shelly Lombard, a senior analyst with Gimme Credit, a firm that follows the bond market, said, ''We hate to be party poopers, but we just can't get that excited about Ford's results.''</p>
        <p>The Way Forward plan, introduced in January 2006 and accelerated last September, calls for the closing of 16 plants and the elimination of 44,000 jobs by 2012, with nine of the plants to be shut by 2008.</p>
        <p>Ford is developing new vehicles, including the boxy Flex crossover, which is due in showrooms next year, as well as a small car in the United States that it expects to sell around 2010.</p>
        <p>Under the recovery plan, Ford does not expect to post a North American profit until 2009. But Mr. Mulally and the chief financial officer, Donat R. Leclair, said Thursday that the company was on target, or even ahead of its plan.</p>
        <p>He largely attributed the wider loss in North America to the decision to cut production of larger vehicles.</p>
        <p>''A big part of that reduction in profit is just a nonrecurrence of last year's inventory build,'' Mr. Leclair said. ''We knew we had overproduced, in retrospect, trucks and S.U.V.'s in the first quarter last year.''</p>
        <p>Ford's sales in the United States fell 13.2 percent in the first quarter. Sales of its Explorer S.U.V. fell 25.7 percent, and those of the F-series pickup truck dropped 14.1 percent. By contrast, sales industrywide fell 1.3 percent.</p>
        <p>Along with the drop in light truck sales, Ford is pulling back on low-return sales to rental car companies, a step that it also being taken by General Motors.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, industrywide sales data showed that Toyota had passed G.M. to rank as the world's biggest carmaker, a status G.M. had held since 1931.</p>
        <p>Toyota's new place at the top of the world market might actually benefit Mr. Mulally in his turnaround effort, said Michael Useem, professor of management at the Wharton School of Finance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Useem said that Mr. Mulally -- who traveled to Japan in December to meet the Toyota chairman, Fujio Cho -- ''could say, in light of this symbolic turning, 'This is the time to get going.' '' Mr. Useem said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Useem, who returned this week from his own visit to Toyota in Japan, said he was concerned that Ford's corporate culture might be getting in the way of Mr. Mulally, who joined the automaker in September after 37 years at Boeing.</p>
        <p>''As you walk into Ford or even G.M. these days, the culture feels different,'' he said. ''It does not have that drive for perfection, the focus on continuous improvement, the attention paid to the small things that Toyota does.''</p>
        <p>Ford employees, he added, ''can't change the mental mapping'' that permeated the company in the last decade, when its sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks generated billions of dollars in profit.</p>
        <p>Even so, some Ford employees have found it hard to leave. On Thursday, the company said about 2,000 hourly workers had changed their minds about accepting incentives to retire early or give up their jobs.</p>
        <p>Ford officials said the decision by those employees to stay would not require another round of buyout offers because the company had initially hoped to persuade 35,000 workers to go, and 37,000 accepted the deals.</p>
        <p>The 2,000 who changed their minds merely put Ford back to its original goal, they said.</p>
        <p>Jerry Sullivan, president of Local 600 of the United Automobile Workers union in Dearborn, the largest U.A.W. outpost at Ford, said workers changed their minds for a variety of reasons. He said some may expect Ford to offer even richer enticements as part of national contract talks this fall, although he cautioned that such sweetened deals had not been discussed with the company.</p>
        <p>Others who hoped to leave Michigan found that they could not sell their houses because of the drop in real estate demand, could not afford homes in new cities, or had not done adequate financial planning for retirement, Mr. Sullivan added.</p>
        <p>Still more workers simply missed familiar routines. ''Old habits are hard to alter,'' he said, ''and they can't imagine not coming to work and seeing those friendly faces and sharing those old stories. Ford is not only a working environment, it provides a social outlet as well.''</p>

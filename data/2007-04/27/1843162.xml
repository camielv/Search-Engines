        <p>Ornamented with passages from Racine and long, earnest conversations at restaurant tables, Emmanuel Bourdieu's ''Poison Friends'' is atmospherically and unmistakably French. But André Morney (Thibault Vinçon), its charismatic central figure, represents a type that can be found in seminar rooms and campus cafes around the world, as well as in the novels of Iris Murdoch. Witty, cynical and erudite, André enthralls two younger, less confident students with his self-assurance and his merciless commitment to criticism. It is not just that he seems to have read and formed a perfectly coherent opinion about everything, or that he enjoys an easy rapport with a pompous and severe literature professor (Jacques Bonnaffé). To his acolytes, Eloi (Malik Zidi) and Alexandre (Alexandre Steiger), André is the heroic embodiment of literary dash and sophistication, a classroom Lord Byron who has already arrived in the exalted realm of knowledge and creativity they aspire to inhabit.</p>
        <p>Not that André actually writes, or believes that anyone else should. He is fond of quoting an epigram from the Austrian essayist Karl Kraus: ''Why do some people write? Because they are too weak not to write.'' Influenced by André's views and terrified of his disapproval, Alexandre abandons playwriting for acting, and Eloi, whose mother is a famous and controversial novelist (Dominique Blanc), discards the manuscript he has kept secret. When André humiliates another student for having the temerity to publish a story in a literary journal, Eloi and Alexandre go along with him, mistaking his sadism for the uncompromising pursuit of aesthetic justice.</p>

        <p>Ornamented with passages from Racine and long, earnest conversations at restaurant tables, Emmanuel Bourdieu's ''Poison Friends'' is atmospherically and unmistakably French. But André Morney (Thibault Vinçon), its charismatic central figure, represents a type that can be found in seminar rooms and campus cafes around the world, as well as in the novels of Iris Murdoch. Witty, cynical and erudite, André enthralls two younger, less confident students with his self-assurance and his merciless commitment to criticism. It is not just that he seems to have read and formed a perfectly coherent opinion about everything, or that he enjoys an easy rapport with a pompous and severe literature professor (Jacques Bonnaffé). To his acolytes, Eloi (Malik Zidi) and Alexandre (Alexandre Steiger), André is the heroic embodiment of literary dash and sophistication, a classroom Lord Byron who has already arrived in the exalted realm of knowledge and creativity they aspire to inhabit.</p>
        <p>Not that André actually writes, or believes that anyone else should. He is fond of quoting an epigram from the Austrian essayist Karl Kraus: ''Why do some people write? Because they are too weak not to write.'' Influenced by André's views and terrified of his disapproval, Alexandre abandons playwriting for acting, and Eloi, whose mother is a famous and controversial novelist (Dominique Blanc), discards the manuscript he has kept secret. When André humiliates another student for having the temerity to publish a story in a literary journal, Eloi and Alexandre go along with him, mistaking his sadism for the uncompromising pursuit of aesthetic justice.</p>
        <p>A coming-of-age comedy with the pace and structure of a thriller, ''Poison Friends'' casts a knowing, sympathetic eye around the fevered precincts of youthful literary and academic ambition, a realm of passion, jealousy and ambiguous motives. Why do some people write? To chase women, or fame, or friends. Most of the women in this movie are writers too, but with the exception of Eloi's mother they function more as prizes in the masculine arena of discipleship and rivalry than as dramatic agents in their own right. This may be a blind spot in the writing (Mr. Bourdieu wrote the screenplay with Marcia Romano) or, more likely, an authentic feature of the milieu he is depicting, but I would have liked to know more about what Marguerite (Natacha Régnier), a librarian who is first André's girlfriend and then Eloi's, thought of the whole scene.</p>
        <p>André may dominate and intimidate Eloi and Alexandre, but he has a lot to teach them nonetheless. Members of the audience inured to the compromises of adulthood -- or who have seen his type before -- may spot André as something of a poseur, not to say a complete fraud, long before his friends do. But Mr. Bourdieu's view of him is not quite so harsh. Yes, André is cruel, vain and insecure, but he is also generous, and the others may be using him even as he is manipulating them for his own amusement. This is especially true of Eloi -- Prince Hal to André's Falstaff -- whose diffidence starts to seem as much a self-protecting pose as André's swaggering arrogance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bourdieu, who has collaborated on several screenplays with the writer and director Arnaud Desplechin, shares Mr. Desplechin's ability to fill perfectly ordinary events with menace and uncertainty. ''Poison Friends'' is too modest and matter-of-fact to achieve the devastating emotional impact of Mr. Desplechin's best films, but Mr. Bourdieu allows an aura of psychological complexity to envelop what turns out to be a fairly schematic story.</p>
        <p>In retrospect the revelations and reversals may look a bit too neat -- too obviously written, André might say, with a sneer -- but as a group portrait of apprentice intellectuals the film has an almost documentary accuracy. It also has a degree of energy, an appetite for strong feelings and big ideas, notably missing in American movies about the young and overeducated, which tend to specialize in mumbled ironies and tiny epiphanies. André and his acolytes may be pretentious and self-dramatizing, but there is nothing slack about them, or about this film.</p>

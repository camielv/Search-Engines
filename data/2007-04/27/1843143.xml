        <p>With 157 feature films to choose from, moviegoers can be forgiven for opting to take a break from screenings at the Tribeca Film Festival. Fortunately, festival organizers predicted as much: they are offering a panoply of talks and events that take place beyond the cineplex. The Tribeca Talks series, at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, offers 12 panels on a range of topics. On Tuesday Don Cheadle and others will grapple with the question of whether movies like ''Blood Diamond'' can actually effect change; on Sunday Debra Messing and Rachel Dratch discuss whether women are funny; and on Wednesday the rapper and actor Ludacris (Chris Bridges) will talk about broader themes in music and movies. ''We draw from the films at the festival, but the series has a life of its own,'' said Annie Leahy, the Talks director. There are also activities tied to the screenings. In the Tribe ca Drive-In series, a luau precedes the outdoor showing of the film ''Surf's Up'' tonight, and a break-dancing performance takes place before tomorrow's screening of ''Planet B-Boy.'' Next weekend the Tribeca/ESPN Sports film festival will end with Sports Saturday, a free outdoor event with sports-related games and demonstrations. (Tribeca Talks through May 5, TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers Street; $25. Tribeca Drive-In, tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, World Financial Center Plaza; free. Sports Saturday, May 5, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., at North Moore Street between Greenwich and West Streets. Information: tribecafilmfestival.org.)</p>

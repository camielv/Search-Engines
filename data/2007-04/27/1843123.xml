        <p>It's best not to worry too much about the exact locations of the eerily desolate landscapes depicted in Carla Klein's paintings, with their expansive horizons, unpopulated terrain and moody, turbulent skies. The works, on view at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, are simply empty, anonymous spaces, sites between destinations in the Southwest that she photographed -- from the side of some road, from a truck-stop parking lot or from the passenger seat of a speeding car -- and then transformed into panoramic paintings. Each painting, however, bears some witness to its origins as a humble snapshot. White borders on the canvas represent areas where the photographic images were cropped, and black lines mark the borders, while droplets of paint refer to scratches on the negative. Sometimes she has even included telling details, like reflections on the car's windshield, the side rear-view mirrors or the top of the dashboard. But over all these paintings are about the fantastical, even dreamlike qualities of the American West, especially the desert, rendered at its most stark, dramatic, serene and severe through a restricted, high-contrast palette of black, blue, gray and white paint. The results (above, ''Untitled,'' 2007) seem simultaneously familiar and foreign, real and imaginary, pleasing to the eyes and eminently collectable. (Through May 5, Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, 212-414-4144, www.tanyabonakdargallery.com.)</p>

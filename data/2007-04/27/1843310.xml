        <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has joined the board of a holding company that owns a troubled commercial college in New York City, and will head a new educational oversight committee, the company announced yesterday. Mr. Kennedy, above, an environmental lawyer, is a director of the EVCI Career Colleges Holding Corporation, which owns Interboro Institute, a two-year business college that has come under scrutiny for improprieties involving student financial aid. In 2005, state education officials directed Interboro to reduce its size so it could better deal with the issue. The company said the problems were isolated, but its stock plummeted and it was sued by investors. Mr. Kennedy said visits to the college convinced him that it was an ''extraordinary'' school that outperformed ''virtually every school in the nation'' in helping disadvantaged minority students. EVCI also announced an agreement for a $17 million financial package with a private equity firm.</p>

        <p>Editorial on Bush administration's undermining of regulatory rules protecting workers by zealous ideologues like Edwin Foulke, Republican party official and anti-union stalwart who has worked tirelessly at OSHA to weaken agency's enforcement authority; says results are described in Times report on life-threatening lung disease suffered by workers at popcorn plants who inhale butter-flavor additive diacetyl; notes huge donations to Republicans from three biggest OSHA-regulated industries: transportation, agribusiness and construction</p>

        <p>The Bush administration has proved indefatigable at finding industry foxes to upend the regulatory chicken coops. The result has been an undermining of restraints on everything from strip miners to long-haul truckers and corporate executives intent on consumer-unfriendly mergers.</p>
        <p>One of the most zealous of the antiregulatory ideologues is Edwin Foulke, tapped by President Bush last year to run the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As South Carolina's Republican Party chairman and an anti-union stalwart, Mr. Foulke worked tirelessly to weaken the agency's enforcement authority on workplace safety. Now that he is OSHA's chief, he is moving even more aggressively away from regulations in favor of corporations' pledges to police themselves.</p>

        <p>The Bush administration has proved indefatigable at finding industry foxes to upend the regulatory chicken coops. The result has been an undermining of restraints on everything from strip miners to long-haul truckers and corporate executives intent on consumer-unfriendly mergers.</p>
        <p>One of the most zealous of the antiregulatory ideologues is Edwin Foulke, tapped by President Bush last year to run the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As South Carolina's Republican Party chairman and an anti-union stalwart, Mr. Foulke worked tirelessly to weaken the agency's enforcement authority on workplace safety. Now that he is OSHA's chief, he is moving even more aggressively away from regulations in favor of corporations' pledges to police themselves.</p>
        <p>The dangers of a do-next-to-nothing OSHA were described in searching detail by Stephen Labaton of The Times in a report focusing on a life-threatening lung disease suffered by workers at microwave popcorn factories who regularly inhale a butter-flavor additive, diacetyl. The problem first turned up seven years ago, with some workers needing lung transplants. Yet OSHA failed to mandate safety standards or step up plant inspections.</p>
        <p>An OSHA inspector sent to a plant three years after workers began getting sick certified that it complied with regulations -- and cited air sampling done four years earlier by an insurer. Another inspector was dispatched to conclude that even if there was a problem, nothing could be done. Why? Because a standard defining safe limits for diacetyl had never been written -- by OSHA.</p>
        <p>President Bush blessed the shameful retreat by OSHA early on, signing the Republican Congress's repeal of an ergonomics regulation for workers. Corporate gratitude has been clear.</p>
        <p>In the Bush years, Republicans have reaped most of $630 million in donations from the three biggest industries regulated by OSHA: transportation, agribusiness and construction. Those industries obviously like what they see and hear from Mr. Foulke, who can't emphasize enough that he ''firmly believes in limited government.''</p>

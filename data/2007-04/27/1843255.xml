        <p>Tony Stewart made comments Tuesday night likening Nascar to professional wrestling and accusing it of using caution flags to shape races.</p>
        <p>Stewart's comments, made on his satellite radio show, came after he skipped a postrace news conference in Phoenix last Saturday night. He dominated the Subway Fresh Fit 500, but was beaten after a late exchange of leads with the eventual winner, Jeff Gordon.</p>
        <p>Stewart, the two-time points champion of Nascar's premier series, said that he refused interviews Saturday night to retaliate against Nascar for what he considered unfair officiating, but also to avoid bashing Nascar publicly.</p>
        <p>Nascar does not force its drivers to meet with members of the news media, but it has postrace procedures in place for the top three finishers and the highest-finishing rookie.</p>
        <p>Officials threw four cautions for debris on the track at Phoenix International Raceway.</p>
        <p>''It's like playing God,'' Stewart said on his radio program. ''They can almost dictate the race instead of the drivers doing it. It's happened too many times this year.''</p>
        <p>Stewart said that fans were complaining about debris cautions, but Nascar was not listening.</p>
        <p>''I guess Nascar thinks, 'Hey, wrestling worked, and it was for the most part staged, so I guess it's going to work in racing, too,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>''I can't understand how long the fans are going to let Nascar treat them like they're stupid before the fans finally turn on Nascar. I don't know that they've run a fair race all year.''</p>
        <p>Jim Hunter, a Nascar spokesman, called Stewart's comments ''very, very disappointing.''</p>
        <p>Although Nascar has a policy that prohibits obscene language and gestures on television, it has no rule against criticizing its officiating.</p>
        <p>Hunter said that Nascar had no plans to punish Stewart for his remarks about officiating, which is done from a tower above the race track by a team of eight that includes Nascar's president, Mike Helton, and its competition director, Robin Pemberton.</p>

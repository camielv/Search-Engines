        <p>Ségolène Royal, the Socialist candidate in the French presidential election on May 6, accused Nicolas Sarkozy, her conservative opponent, on Wednesday of having ''apologized'' to President Bush for France's decision not to back the United States militarily in Iraq.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy's campaign team called her words ''lies.''</p>
        <p>''I am not for a Europe that aligns with the U.S.,'' Ms. Royal said on France 2 television. ''I have never been, and will never, go apologize to President Bush for the position of France on the issue of refusing to send our troops to Iraq.''</p>
        <p>The interviewer noted that Mr. Sarkozy's official position was that he had supported President Jacques Chirac's opposition to the war and to French participation in military operations in Iraq.</p>
        <p>''Yes, well, listen,'' Ms. Royal responded. ''He still did this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy's team issued a strongly worded statement on Thursday morning, repeating his position that the war in Iraq was a mistake and that he backed Mr. Chirac's decision to refuse to send French troops.</p>
        <p>The statement called for Ms. Royal to ''stop using lies and personal attacks to preserve the dignity and qualities of the presidential debate.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Royal repeated her criticism on Thursday evening, telling TF1 television, ''He may have changed his posture, but I think all the French were shocked by his move when he visited George Bush, denouncing French arrogance and apologizing for the French position.''</p>
        <p>While in the United States in September, Mr. Sarkozy, then the interior minister, sought to distance himself from what he considered France's clumsy method of diplomacy, but he repeated his opposition to the war. He met with President Bush at the White House and they posed for a photo, which prompted much commentary in the French news media.</p>
        <p>''We know that a meeting was negotiated,'' Arnaud Montebourg, a spokesman for Ms. Royal, said in an interview. ''This showed that in exchange, he had made verbal concessions showing he separated himself from French diplomacy.''</p>
        <p>Asked if the Socialist Party had any evidence that Mr. Sarkozy had ''apologized'' for not sending troops to Iraq, he replied: ''These are facts. How do you want Mr. Bush to shake the hand of a leader without some sort of opening on his part?''</p>
        <p>The battle between Mr. Sarkozy, who received 31 percent of the vote on Sunday in the first round of the presidential election, and Ms. Royal, who got 26 percent, is intensifying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy's opponents have often emphasized his perceived affinity for the United States. In January, a Socialist Party pamphlet called him an ''American neoconservative with a French passport.''</p>

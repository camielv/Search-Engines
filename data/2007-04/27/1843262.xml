        <p>Opens today in the New York metropolitan area.  Directed by Bruce Leddy  Not rated; 94 minutes</p>
        <p>In ''Sing Now or Forever Hold Your Peace,'' Bruce Leddy's ensemble dramedy about a seven-man college a cappella group reuniting after 15 years to perform at a classmate's wedding, midlife crisis is the prevailing refrain. At a Hamptons rehearsal weekend, an office technician (David Harbour) frets about age; a divorced lawyer (Reg Rogers) bemoans bachelorhood; a fired money manager (Alexander Chaplin) fears for his marriage. Also on hand are three wives, a girlfriend and a fetching Swedish nanny.</p>
        <p>''Sing Now,'' a ''Big Chill'' for today's 36-year-olds, aims to put wisdom and unrelenting quippery in a seaside light, buoyed with easily digested a cappella versions of songs by Coldplay, Phil Collins and their ilk. But its dramatic freight lurches, and intriguing characters (a sex savant, an Indian human beat box) are sold short; a thinning of the ranks might have helped.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there is Molly Shannon as the money manager's disgruntled wife, giving a selfless, robust performance. Bracingly astringent in an unlikable role, she almost turns a potential liability into the film's salvation.</p>
        <p>ANDY WEBSTER</p>
        <p>''Sing Now or Forever Hold Your Peace'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and nudity. The a cappella covers are strictly G.</p>

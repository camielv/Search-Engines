        <p>What does the phrase ''hula dancing'' bring to mind? For some it's the Elvis Presley movie ''Blue Hawaii.'' Or plastic flowers, cellophane skirts, perhaps even a coconut brassiere. It is unlikely to suggest the image of Hi'iaka, the patron goddess of Hawaii, dancing for her sister Pele, the goddess of volcanic fire, to introduce a sacred ritual. But that's where it all started, according to this solo show, written and performed by Keo Woolford, whose first name, he says, is pronounced ''like O.K. backwards.'' To Mr. Woolford, left, hula is more than Hollywood kitsch. It is an important aspect of his identity and that of his home state. His show, he said after a recent preview performance, ''is not a history lesson or educational device,'' though it does much to counteract the perception that Hawaii is merely a vacation fantasy land. As Mr. Woolford reveals his journey, from growing up in Hawaii to starring in ''The King and I'' on the West End to performing with the Hawaiian boy band Brownskin, his sense of humor is apparent throughout. Created with and directed by Roberta Uno, and produced by the Ma-Yi Theater Company, ''I Land'' features plenty of dancing too -- a combination of hula, hip-hop and even a dose of disco -- choreographed by the hula kuma (teacher) Robert Cazimero and Ana (Rokafella) Garcia. But the show's serious underpinnings are clear. ''We wanted to open this window, so that you would actually ask yourself the question, 'What do I now know about this world that I assumed I knew everything about?' '' Ms. Uno said. (Through May 13, the Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, 212-352-3101, theatermania.com; $38; $25 for students; $35 for 65+.)</p>

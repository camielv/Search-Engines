        <p>''Epitaph,'' Charles Mingus's two-hour suite for 31 musicians, is famous for its unwieldiness. It is long, intensive and complicated. Parts of it were performed at a doomed Town Hall concert in 1962, and all of it was played posthumously in 1989, after the sheet music was found among Mingus's papers, at a successful but still nerve-racking concert at Lincoln Center. On Wednesday night ''Epitaph,'' made still bigger by new material, had its third New York iteration, at Jazz at Lincoln Center's Rose Theater. It started shakily, but by the end it had made its case.</p>
        <p>Above all, ''Epitaph'' is packed with melodies. Parts of it became well known before 1989, through Mingus's recordings with smaller bands, including ''Better Git Hit in Your Soul'' and ''Peggy's Blue Skylight.'' Sometimes outside composers' music floats through its sections in mutated form -- including Jelly Roll Morton's ''Wolverine Blues,'' Thelonious Monk's ''Well, You Needn't'' and Vernon Duke's ''I Can't Get Started.''

        <p>''Epitaph,'' Charles Mingus's two-hour suite for 31 musicians, is famous for its unwieldiness. It is long, intensive and complicated. Parts of it were performed at a doomed Town Hall concert in 1962, and all of it was played posthumously in 1989, after the sheet music was found among Mingus's papers, at a successful but still nerve-racking concert at Lincoln Center. On Wednesday night ''Epitaph,'' made still bigger by new material, had its third New York iteration, at Jazz at Lincoln Center's Rose Theater. It started shakily, but by the end it had made its case.</p>
        <p>Above all, ''Epitaph'' is packed with melodies. Parts of it became well known before 1989, through Mingus's recordings with smaller bands, including ''Better Git Hit in Your Soul'' and ''Peggy's Blue Skylight.'' Sometimes outside composers' music floats through its sections in mutated form -- including Jelly Roll Morton's ''Wolverine Blues,'' Thelonious Monk's ''Well, You Needn't'' and Vernon Duke's ''I Can't Get Started.'' Some other sections, more associated solely with ''Epitaph,'' are stubborn with originality.</p>
        <p>''The Children's Hour of Dream,'' which comes in the middle of the second half of the concert, was a good example. It is a strong synthesis of classical composition and jazz, full of ominous rumblings, orchestrated-brass brayings, sweet and sour reed-section harmonies, and written parts for two classical percussionists. On Wednesday it was a complicated task beautifully executed.</p>
        <p>As opposed to most ambitious long-form works in jazz, a great deal of ''Epitaph'' was extremely well practiced. Most of the musicians on Wednesday have been involved in either the Mingus Big Band, the Mingus Orchestra or Mingus Dynasty, three groups overseen by the composer's widow, Sue Mingus. And so they have had years to develop some of the more difficult pieces -- if only in more slimmed-down arrangements -- and to smooth their edges. Such was the case with ''The Children's Hour of Dream'' and the ballad ''Noon Night.''</p>
        <p>But some other parts ran into trouble, especially during the first half of the concert. There were rough patches when the music was most full of incident: shifts or overlappings between melodic strains; parts skidding to a stop, tempos picking up gradually, constant cross-talking between extreme-register instruments. The trouble wasn't so surprising in a band this big: two pianists, two bassists (Christian McBride and Boris Kozlov), a drummer and two percussionists, not to mention bassoon, contrabass clarinet and tuba.</p>
        <p>But more to the point, it wasn't so surprising in music so unusual for jazz, veering between blues language, Ives-like polytonality and tone poems with fast phrases and vertiginous jumps in register made to challenge good musicians.</p>
        <p>The trumpeters Lew Soloff and Jack Walrath, from the 1989 version of ''Epitaph,'' were in the 31-piece band; so was the conductor, Gunther Schuller, who had an important role in shaping that full premiere.</p>
        <p>Some further reconstructive work has been done since then. The dark, thorny ''Inquisition,'' adapted from a piece in the original ''Epitaph'' called ''Moods in Mambo,'' was newly woven in, as well as another Mingus piece, ''This Subdues My Passion.'' And with few other changes from the 1989 version -- ''Better Git Hit in Your Soul'' was performed here with full orchestra, whereas a sextet played it back then -- a complicated and occasionally brilliant piece of jazz repertory saw another day, and became a little more venerable.</p>
        <p>''Epitaph'' will be performed again tonight in Cleveland, on May 16 in Los Angeles and on May 18 in Chicago. Details can be found at mingusmingusmingus.com.</p>

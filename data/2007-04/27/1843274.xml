        <p>Paintings and Drawings From the 1950s &amp; 1960s  Ubu Gallery  416 East 59th Street, Clinton  Through May 12</p>
        <p>The art of the German Surrealist Richard Oelze may be a taste you never acquire, but his obsessive union of the fleshy, the feathery and the geological into soft, decaying, Piranesi-esque grottos is worth knowing about. It is doubly so if your interests already run to German artists like Hans Bellmer, Wols, Konrad Klapheck or Erwin Pfrang. This exhibition of 22 paintings and 19 drawings from the 1950s and '60s is the first in this country devoted to Oelze (1900-1980).</p>

        <p>Paintings and Drawings From the 1950s &amp; 1960s  Ubu Gallery  416 East 59th Street, Clinton  Through May 12</p>
        <p>The art of the German Surrealist Richard Oelze may be a taste you never acquire, but his obsessive union of the fleshy, the feathery and the geological into soft, decaying, Piranesi-esque grottos is worth knowing about. It is doubly so if your interests already run to German artists like Hans Bellmer, Wols, Konrad Klapheck or Erwin Pfrang. This exhibition of 22 paintings and 19 drawings from the 1950s and '60s is the first in this country devoted to Oelze (1900-1980).</p>
        <p>He served in the German Army in both world wars, which may explain the pessimistic tenor of his art. Between them, he studied at the Bauhaus, encountered the work of Max Ernst, Salvador Dalí and René Magritte and lived in Paris long enough to meet the Surrealists. He participated in numerous Surrealist exhibitions, including the Museum of Modern Art's 1936 ''Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism.''</p>
        <p>His 1936 painting ''Expectations'' has been in the Modern's collection since 1940. It shows a crowd of people -- mostly men in fedoras and overcoats -- with their backs turned, staring across some trees toward a dark sky. The debt to Ernst and Magritte is clear; so is the striking resemblance to scenes from the 1951 sci-fi classic ''The Day the Earth Stood Still.''</p>
        <p>After World War II, Oelze's art seems to have imploded. A few works depict isolated figures, human and otherwise, that are actually aggregates of birds or other creatures. In ''Imaginary Portrait,'' an unusually intact, bright-eyed, baby-faced man emerges from a cloud of soot.</p>
        <p>But mostly the animate and inanimate collapse into strange, pulpy edifices and landscapes composed of little, fistlike mounds of flesh that are pocked with hooded eyes, stubby profiles or nonspecific protuberances; sometimes faces and figures are discernible. These organic facades vary in density from fog-bound, land-locked solidity to levitating, torn-paper thinness, with sky showing between the cracks.</p>
        <p>But they are primarily velvety accumulations of marks and textures, gauzy and layered like a series of scrims, a kind of eyes-wide-open automatism in which Oelze explored his dreams and his obvious loneliness while revealing the world's fertile rottenness.</p>
        <p>From an American standpoint, Oelze's art might be linked, in three very different directions, to that of Pavel Tchelitchew, Myron Stout and Lee Bontecou. It is wonderful to be able to add his smooth-on-the-outside, jagged-on-the-inside career to the ever more complex puzzle of postwar art.</p>

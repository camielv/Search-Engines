        <p>Bill Callahan  ''Woke on a Whaleheart''  (Drag City)</p>
        <p>A few years ago the Italian-Icelandic singer Emiliana Torrini recorded an exquisite song called ''Honeymoon Child.'' Accompanied by nothing besides a flickering guitar she murmured, ''You are a true honeymoon child, conceived on an island in the sun/Heels dug in the white sand, loved and adored by everyone.''</p>

        <p>Bill Callahan  ''Woke on a Whaleheart''  (Drag City)</p>
        <p>A few years ago the Italian-Icelandic singer Emiliana Torrini recorded an exquisite song called ''Honeymoon Child.'' Accompanied by nothing besides a flickering guitar she murmured, ''You are a true honeymoon child, conceived on an island in the sun/Heels dug in the white sand, loved and adored by everyone.''</p>
        <p>Listeners who read the credits might have noticed that the song was written by Bill Callahan, the indie-rock singer-songwriter who records as Smog. Or used to. His new album, ''Woke on a Whaleheart,'' is the first one released under his own name. It includes his own version of ''Honeymoon Child,'' which tugs the story in a different direction. Where Ms. Torrini sounded affectionate, Mr. Callahan sounds as if he's reserving judgment for a while, or forever. He has perfected a singing-talking hybrid that can make him sound like a (nearly) dispassionate narrator. Near the end of ''Honeymoon Child,'' there's an ominous but mysterious twist: ''Mr. Bones from town said he saw you the other day/Said you'd changed but he wouldn't say how.'' That can't be good news. Can it?</p>
        <p>In the years since his 1990 debut album, ''Sewn to the Sky,'' Mr. Callahan has ruthlessly revised and edited his approach, discarding much of the noise -- lo-fi distortion, extra instruments -- so that listeners can (or have to) concentrate on those obstinate chord progressions and that obstinate voice.</p>
        <p>Still, by Mr. Callahan's standards, ''Woke on a Whaleheart'' is an exuberant album; it includes a skewed gospel song (''The Wheel'') and an unexpectedly forthright, if long-winded, love song (''From the Rivers to the Ocean''). ''Day'' seems to be a bitter (if vague) protest song, but the stern opening line -- ''Some people are a sickness on this land'' -- soon gives way to a playful instruction: ''Learn from the animals/Monkeys do, monkeys do, monkeys do piggish things too.''</p>
        <p>There are times when Mr. Callahan's deliberate, word-centric approach seems merely perverse instead of brave, and somehow the album seems much shorter than its 40 minutes, as if it's only a sketch for what's next. So: what's next?</p>

        <p>Robert Smith, the former head of the Republican Party in Onondaga County, says a top Senate Republican official repeatedly threatened the job security of a candidate seeking an upstate Senate seat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith's comments raised questions about what role, if any, Senate Republicans played in the subsequent firing of the candidate, Thomas V. Dadey Jr., from his job at a large state contractor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dadey challenged Senator Nancy Larraine Hoffmann in a 2004 Republican primary for her seat, which represents parts of Syracuse, in Onondaga County. Although Mr. Dadey lost, he remained on the ballot on the Conservative Party line in the general election and was blamed for contributing to Ms. Hoffmann's ultimate defeat -- and the loss of a seat for Senate Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said he had been repeatedly told by Steven M. Boggess, the secretary of the Senate and a top assistant to Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, that Mr. Dadey's political activity would jeopardize his job at a large engineering firm, Clough Harbour &amp; Associates.</p>
        <p>''I was specifically told that Mr. Dadey's employer was a major state contractor,'' Mr. Smith said in an affidavit. ''It was clear to me that they were threatening Mr. Dadey's employment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dadey was fired in January 2006 by Clough Harbour, as he was considering another run for the same Senate seat. He sued the company, claiming it had unlawfully fired him for political activity that was protected under state labor law.</p>
        <p>His letter of dismissal said the firm could no longer employ Mr. Dadey, ''as your political activities may have an adverse impact'' on the firm's business.</p>
        <p>Clough Harbour declined to comment, but in court filings the company has denied the allegations in Mr. Dadey's suit.</p>
        <p>John A. McArdle, a spokesman for the Republican leadership in the Senate, called the allegations ''nonsense,'' adding, ''It's not even worth commenting on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith has been an outspoken critic of Mr. Bruno's leadership since he stepped down as chairman of the Onondaga County Republicans last year. He was deposed by Mr. Dadey's lawyers, though he has not signed the subsequent affidavit. Mr. Smith confirmed its accuracy in an interview, but said he wanted to make clear that Mr. Boggess never directly said he was going to have Mr. Dadey fired.</p>
        <p>''Did he ever call me and say we're going to get him fired? No,'' Mr. Smith said. ''But he was very clear.''</p>
        <p>The affidavit was obtained by The New York Times from Mr. Dadey.</p>
        <p>In it, Mr. Smith describes several phone conversations with Mr. Boggess starting in September 2005, while Mr. Dadey was considering running again.</p>
        <p>''He repeatedly asked me if Mr. Dadey knew what was at stake,'' Mr. Smith recalled, adding, ''he repeatedly focused on Mr. Dadey's responsibility to 'provide for his children.' ''</p>
        <p>The conversations continued through January of last year.</p>
        <p>''In virtually every discussion, the issue of Mr. Dadey's employment with Clough Harbour came up,'' Mr. Smith said, adding that he recalled Mr. Boggess saying, ''does Mr. Dadey understand he's going to lose his job?''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Dadey was fired, Mr. Smith said, he called Mr. Boggess, who ''immediately said, 'We didn't do it.' '' But Mr. Smith also said that Mr. Boggess told him he had attended a dinner with Clough Harbour's chief executive, Raymond Kinley, Jr., who told him, ''It's done.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said he later told Mr. Bruno what had happened, but the majority leader appeared to be unaware of Mr. Dadey's firing.</p>
        <p>''Are you sure?'' Mr. Bruno replied. ''Steve needs to hear this.''</p>

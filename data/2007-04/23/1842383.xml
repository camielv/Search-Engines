        <p>'Disturbia' Rules the Box Office</p>
        <p>''Disturbia'' (distributed by Paramount) remained No. 1 at North American box offices over the weekend, taking in $13.4 million in its second week in theaters. But ''Blades of Glory'' (Paramount), whose $7.8 million brought its cumulative total to $101 million in its fourth week, dropped a notch, relinquishing second place to a newcomer, ''Fracture'' (New Line), a thriller starring Anthony Hopkins, left, and Ryan Gosling. It took in $11.1 million, according to the estimates of the box-office tracking company Media by Numbers. Fourth place and $7.6 million went to another new release, ''Vacancy'' (Sony/Screen Gems), with Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson as a couple trapped in a deadly motor inn. Finishing off the top five with $7 million in its fourth week was ''Meet the Robinsons'' (Buena Vista).</p>
        <p>Princess of Wales Inspires Ballet</p>
        <p>A Russian theater company plans a ballet based on the life and death of Diana, Princess of Wales, Agence France-Presse reported. Citing the newspaper Izvestia, the news agency reported that the Premera company had hired the British dancer and director Gillian Lynne to choreograph the work, tentatively scheduled to open in the fall in Moscow at the Stanislavsky-Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theater. The lead role will be performed by the renowned Russian dancer Ilze Liepa.</p>
        <p>Commission Approves Chicago Spire</p>
        <p>The Chicago Spire, above, a 2,000-foot tower designed by Santiago Calatrava, has been approved by the Chicago Planning Commission. The structure, with 1,200 residences, would be on North Lake Shore Drive, where the Chicago River meets Lake Michigan. It still needs the approval of the City Council. Construction would begin this spring, with completion in 2010.</p>
        <p>CBS Sues Over Imus Broadcasts</p>
        <p>CBS has filed a federal lawsuit against a small California radio station, KCAA-AM, for broadcasting reruns of the Don Imus program after his firing for sexist and racist comments about the Rutgers University women's basketball team, The Associated Press reported. The suit, which seeks a temporary restraining order and $150,000 for each violation, was filed in Riverside, Calif., and argues that the license holder and the station, reaching areas east and south of Los Angeles, violated copyright protection. The station, which had carried Mr. Imus's morning show since 2003, began to broadcast old shows last Monday along with listener calls, mail and e-mail reacting to the controversy. CBS said it had asked the station to stop. Brian Oxman, a lawyer for the station, said it was trying to educate the public. Its chairman, Fred Lindgren, wrote to lawyers for CBS to say that KCAA plans to continue the broadcasts through Friday before destroying its Imus materials and tapes. A court hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>'39 Steps' to Cross The Atlantic</p>
        <p>With four actors playing its 150 roles, the prize-winning London adaptation of the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock thriller ''The 39 Steps'' is bound for Broadway after a stop in Boston, Theatre.com reported. The comical stage version, which promises to include everything from a chase aboard a speeding train called the Flying Scotsman to an escape from Scotland's Forth Rail Bridge and a plane crash, is to have its United States premiere at the Huntington Theater in Boston from Sept. 14 to Oct. 14 before moving to Broadway. The show, adapted by Patrick Barlow and directed by Maria Aitken, won this year's Laurence Olivier Award for best new comedy.</p>
        <p>Sorry, No Concert</p>
        <p>Citing hoarseness, the tenor Plácido Domingo, 66, canceled a concert at the last minute in Lisbon on Saturday night, Agence France-Presse reported. Appearing onstage before an audience of 2,000 in the Atlantic Pavillon, he said he was suffering from ''persistent hoarseness'' and would be unable to sing.  Guns N' Roses has called off its performances in South Africa because its bass guitarist, Tommy Stinson, fell down a flight of stairs and injured his hand, Agence France-Presse reported. Along with its lead singer, Axl Rose, the band had been scheduled to perform in Johannesburg on Friday and in Cape Town on May 1.</p>
        <p>An Airline as Film Editor</p>
        <p>British Airways has taken the scissors to the latest James Bond film, ''Casino Royale,'' cutting a cameo appearance by Richard Branson, below, the chairman of a rival airline, Virgin Atlantic, and obscuring the tail fin of a Virgin plane, The Associated Press reported. ''We have full control over what is shown,'' a British Airways spokesman said. Mr. Branson is seen in the film as he turns around after walking through a metal detector at Miami International Airport. His airline provided the producers of ''Casino Royale'' with a plane seen in the film. Paul Charles, a spokesman for Virgin Atlantic, said, ''We think passengers should see the whole film and nothing but the whole film.'' Last year, Virgin Atlantic provided the authorities in the United States and Britain with information that involved British Airways in an investigation of possible price-fixing in passenger fares and fuel surcharges.</p>

        <p>Auction Benefits Hurricane-Hit Musicians</p>
        <p>A Gibson Les Paul guitar donated by The Edge, below, of U2 fetched $240,000 from an anonymous buyer at an auction on Saturday to benefit musicians who lost their possessions in Hurricane Katrina, Reuters reported. In all, the sale at the Hard Rock Cafe in Manhattan raised $2.3 million, including a 20 percent buyer's fee, for Music Rising, a charity established by The Edge and other musicians after the hurricane in 2005. Among the more than 200 items that were sold were Jimi Hendrix's 1966 Red Fender Mustang guitar, which brought in $400,000; former President Bill Clinton's saxophone ($54,000); and a pair of John Lennon's round, blue-tinted sunglasses ($30,000).

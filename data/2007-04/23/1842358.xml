        <p>9 P.M. (13, 49) SUMMER OF LOVE -- The summer of 1967 has been romanticized as a time of peace and understanding, but many of the thousands of young people who descended on the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco at the time found that the hippie experience was already disappearing. This ''American Experience'' segment shines some light on a cultural phenomenon that many still can't explain.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (TLC) LITTLE PEOPLE, BIG WORLD -- The day-to-day trifles and triumphs of family life are filled with unusual milestones for the Roloffs, a family made up of both little and average-size people. Tonight at 8 the patriarch, Matt Roloff, makes a motivational speech at a Pennsylvania college, and at 8:30 the twins -- Zach, of average height, and Jeremy, who is not quite 4 feet tall -- turn 16.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (BBC America) WAKING THE DEAD -- America doesn't have the copyright on television investigative teams. Chief Inspector Boyd (Trevor Eve, above left) and his crew reopen cases long considered unsolvable and tie up the loose ends. In the American premiere of the series's sixth season, the death of a teenage boy found with his brother's ear in his stomach leads the team into the world of Irish Gypsies.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (CBS) TWO AND A HALF MEN -- Alan's (Jon Cryer) new friend, a gay single father, has the brothers re-evaluating their sexual identities. Jake (Angus T. Jones), however, is sure he has a crush on the friend's daughter.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (History Channel) CITIES OF THE UNDERWORLD -- The premiere of this series highlights the more dangerous days of the now scenic city of Edinburgh. While a contemporary visit might lead to nothing worse than a bad hangover from good Scotch, the host Eric Geller discovers that Edinburgh's past may have included body snatchers, illegal hooch and plague victims buried alive.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Food Network) DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES -- Guy Fieri already has a show, ''Guy's Big Bite,'' on his résumé. But now this chef takes his tats and his bleached-blond hair on the road to sample greasy-spoon fare from coast to coast.</p>
        <p>10:01 P.M. (NBC) THE REAL WEDDING CRASHERS -- Pulling pranks at a wedding sounds like a sure way to turn a bride into a bridezilla. But in this new reality series, the happy couples are in on the joke. The people behind the movie ''Wedding Crashers'' and MTV's ''Punk'd'' combine their M.O.'s and send a troupe of five improv actors into a wedding ceremony to wreak havoc among the guests. The first installment is set in Las Vegas of course.</p>

        <p>A nurse who had tried to save some of the babies was also injured, with burns to the arms and face, Mr. Champara said in a telephone interview. Nineteen others were being treated for smoke inhalation and were not thought to be in critical condition, he said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 24, 2007, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, a brief article yesterday about a deadly orphanage fire in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo referred incorrectly in some copies to the location of Ljubljana, the city in the dateline, where the article was reported and written. It is in Slovenia, not Slovakia.</p>

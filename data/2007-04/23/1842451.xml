        <p>The governor unveiled his priorities for the rest of the legislative session this week, but lawmakers offered up their own wish list items. Among the more notable was one by Senator Dean G. Skelos, left, a Long Island Republican and the deputy majority leader, who said he would introduce legislation to bring back tax incentives for hybrid electric vehicles. On another front, Assemblymen Keith L. T.

        <p>Two men were killed in shootings in Brooklyn and Queens yesterday morning, the police said. In Queens, a 22-year-old man was shot once in the chest at Martense Avenue and 104th Street shortly before 1:30 a.m., the police said. There were no arrests yesterday, and the victim's name was not released. In Brooklyn, a fight that began in Nostrand Donut Shop spilled outside, and a 20-year-old man, whose name was not released, was fatally shot in the chest, the police and witnesses said. The shooting occurred at Church Street and Nostrand Avenue shortly before 6 a.m. ''I heard an argument, fighting in the doughnut shop, and then it went outside,'' said Khaled Saleh, 38. ''I heard the shot, like a small gun, one shot. One shot, that's his life.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 27, 2007, Friday  A report in the Metro Briefing column on Monday about the deaths of two men in shootings in Brooklyn and Queens referred incorrectly to the location of the Brooklyn shooting. It took place at Nostrand Avenue and Church Avenue, not Church Street.</p>

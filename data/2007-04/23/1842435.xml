        <p>When John Walls, a lifelong Giants fan, read that Jean Strahan, ex-wife of the superstar defensive end Michael Strahan, was having a garage sale at her stately mountainside mansion, he rushed here with his family in hopes of scoring some memorabilia.</p>
        <p>He, like dozens of others, left disappointed.</p>
        <p>''Junk, junk and more junk'' is how Mr. Walls, 45, a consultant from Rahway, N.J., described the weekend sale, which by Sunday was mostly down to artificial plants, size 4 women's jeans, dog toys and pink baby clothes.</p>
        <p>At the $3.6 million three-story, century-old house that the Strahans bought together in 2000, Mrs. Strahan, 41, chatted with customers, breezing in and out, fetching more items to sell. She also helped her 2-year-old twin daughters, Isabella and Sophia, as they sold lemonade and chocolate chip cookies between the white pillars near the front door. All three wore matching pairs of pink Crocs on their feet, and the twins sported pink dresses adorned with palm trees.</p>
        <p>''If you're looking for baby clothes or dog toys, this is the place,'' Mrs. Strahan said. ''There is no memorabilia.''</p>
        <p>She added that what had fetched the highest price so far was a batch of ''Star Trek'' merchandise belonging to a neighbor that sold on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The only sports-related items were a dog chew toy shaped like a football and a dog crate with a Giants sticker on the side. The chew toy was priced at 50 cents, the kennel $5.</p>
        <p>The Strahans, who married in 1999, went through a very public divorce in 2005. The contents of a bookshelf at the sale hinted at a tumultuous relationship. Nestled between volumes on rearing twins was a book titled ''Divorce and Fatherhood: The Struggle for Parental Identity.'' Another was simply titled ''Stress.''</p>
        <p>Donna Hernandez, 49, a retired police captain who lives in Belleville, N.J., said curiosity brought her to the sale. She left it, she said, with the impression that problems transcend tax brackets.</p>
        <p>''Knowing that these people with millions of dollars are selling such small items, like their children's clothing, I see it as sad,'' she said, having walked past a plastic tub of used children's socks selling for a quarter a pair.</p>
        <p>Albert Marshall, 59, of Montclair, who paid $40 for an air-conditioner that had been priced at $60, said he had come to see the view from the multimillion-dollar house, a panorama of the Manhattan skyline towering in the sunny distance. ''I'd give anything to have a view like that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Peter Frank, 59, who lives in the neighborhood, said that garage sales on the block were ''highly unusual,'' but added that he would miss the Strahans. Mr. Strahan no longer lives in the house, and Mrs. Strahan says she plans to move with her daughters to another home.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Strahan, who was awarded more than $15 million in the divorce, said she would donate any unsold items to charity. She added that the sale was ''very busy'' and that she had not kept track of the proceeds and was just happy to be clearing out the house.</p>
        <p>Kerry Quinn, 43, of South Orange, N.J., said the ''lure of celebrity'' had brought him to the sale, where he bought a pair of plant trellises for his front porch.</p>
        <p>''And I'm going to remind everybody where they came from,'' he said.</p>

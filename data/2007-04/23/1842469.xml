        <p>Two police supervisors are being investigated after officers accused them of referring to them as ''hos'' or a ''nappy-headed ho,'' the police said. One instance took place in the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn on April 15. The supervisor in that case has been transferred and stripped of supervisory duties, said Chief Michael Collins, a police spokesman. Chief Collins said the supervisor was accused of having addressed a group of officers jokingly as ''hos.'' The supervisor was identified by Bonita Zelman, a lawyer for the accusers, as Sgt. Carlos Mateo. In the second case, a Queens narcotics detective, Aretha Williams, said yesterday at a news conference that a sergeant recently told her, ''Don't give me no lip, or I'll have to call you a nappy-headed ho.'' The police, who did not release the sergeant's name, said that case would be reviewed this week. The radio host Don Imus was fired recently by CBS Radio for his on-air description of members of the Rutgers University women's basketball team as ''nappy-headed hos.'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in a statement yesterday, ''This language is unacceptable under any circumstances and even more egregious when it comes from individuals in a position of authority.'' A representative of the Sergeants Benevolent Association contacted last night said he knew nothing about the accusations and declined to comment.</p>

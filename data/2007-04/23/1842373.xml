        <p>The study was conducted through random telephone interviews with 1,925 Arbitron diary keepers, and it lumped together satellite subscribers, recent Internet-radio listeners and anyone who had ever downloaded a podcast.</p>

        <p>As a group, fans of digital radio do not listen to traditional radio less than everyone else. In fact, they listen to slightly more, according to a study recently released by Arbitron and Edison Media Research.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted through random telephone interviews with 1,925 Arbitron diary keepers, and it lumped together satellite subscribers, recent Internet-radio listeners and anyone who had ever downloaded a podcast.</p>
        <p>The data suggest that, generally speaking, fans of digital radio are seeking to supplement, not replace, traditional radio. ''Heavy users of digital media don't think, 'If I'm doing this more, I'm doing the other thing less,' '' said Bill Rose, an executive with Arbitron.</p>
        <p>Another study released by Arbitron in February showed that the average satellite radio subscriber listened to less AM/FM radio than the average consumer. But traditional radio was still the largest single component in such people's auditory diet, edging out satellite radio (one and a half hours daily) or Internet radio (an hour and 10 minutes).</p>

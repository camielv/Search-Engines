        <p>Of how many pop and jazz singers can it be said that as soon as they open their mouths, you can rest in complete confidence that every note will be hit squarely in the middle? From a position of such security, the singer can then go on to play with pitch, dipping and bending notes and adding filigree, but always with the ear and discipline of a musician who knows that a quarter-tone deviation is exactly 0.25, no more, no less.</p>
        <p>Sarah Vaughan had that kind of musicality, and so does Dianne Reeves, who gave four concerts this weekend at the Allen Room in Frederick P. Rose Hall. Although Ms. Reeves makes a mighty sound, it is only distantly related to the kind of gospel in a which a performer becomes carried away. Ms. Reeves doesn't. Like Vaughan, she has the resources of an opera singer who has chosen jazz. Her voice is clear and robust; it is an instrument that celebrates itself through its sheer power. As she performed with her trio -- Billy Childs on piano, Reginald Veal on bass and Gregory Hutchinson on drums -- at Friday's early show, you had the sense of a classical singer communing with a chamber group on a high musical plane.</p>

        <p>Sarah Vaughan had that kind of musicality, and so does Dianne Reeves, who gave four concerts this weekend at the Allen Room in Frederick P. Rose Hall. Although Ms. Reeves makes a mighty sound, it is only distantly related to the kind of gospel in a which a performer becomes carried away. Ms. Reeves doesn't. Like Vaughan, she has the resources of an opera singer who has chosen jazz. Her voice is clear and robust; it is an instrument that celebrates itself through its sheer power. As she performed with her trio -- Billy Childs on piano, Reginald Veal on bass and Gregory Hutchinson on drums -- at Friday's early show, you had the sense of a classical singer communing with a chamber group on a high musical plane.</p>
        <p>The other great influence on Ms. Reeves is Betty Carter, whose angular, tonal improvisations went much farther into the ozone than does Ms. Reeves, whose scatting never loses sight of the song under examination. Shying away from the abstract, she understands that the frequently misunderstood and misused concept of scat doesn't mean supplying doodly-doodly-doo filler that sounds jazzy. It means stretching a song into the realm where the voice becomes a jazz instrument, in her case most often a trumpet, and inventing her own instrumental solos. She does it with such skill and taste that you never have the feeling of the singer's wandering into a no man's land. Her improvisations add meaning and a deeper sense of emotional connection.</p>
        <p>Her ambitious first set on Friday leaned toward bossa nova, with Jobim's ''Triste'' and ''Once I Loved,'' both given full-bodied articulation. The elegant, percussive song ''A Child Is Born'' churned with African clicks and beats. Leonard Cohen's ''Suzanne'' became a mystical fantasia built around Mr. Child's splaying keyboard.</p>
        <p>The set ended with McCoy Tyner's ballad ''You Taught My Heart to Sing,'' a love song that Ms. Reeves turned into a personal expression of her relationship to music. ''The miracle of you/Will last my whole life through/You're all I keep remembering/You taught my heart to sing,'' goes the lyric of the ballad, in which Ms. Reeves became a songbird infused with the music in the air; she slowly walked off the stage improvising in a state quiet rapture.</p>
        <p>Since I first saw her, more than two decades ago in a club where she was introduced by Harry Belafonte, Ms. Reeves has steadily developed from a shy, closed-off performer into one of the greatest living jazz singers. There was a period when it looked as if the tradition of Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday was behind us. But with the appearance of singers like Ms. Reeves, and the remarkable Lizz Wright, those shoes are beginning to be filled. Hallelujah!</p>

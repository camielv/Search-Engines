        <p>Gov. Jon S. Corzine showed signs of improvement yesterday, his doctors and aides said, eating solid food for the first time since he was seriously injured in a car accident 10 days ago, conversing with his family and watching part of the New Jersey Devils playoff hockey game on television.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine remained in critical but stable condition in the trauma intensive care unit of Cooper University Hospital in Camden, N.J., where he was receiving pain medication as he recovered from severe chest injuries, including a broken breast bone and fractured ribs, and a broken thigh bone. Mr. Corzine was on a ventilator until Friday afternoon, and has been breathing without assistance since then.</p>

        <p>Gov. Jon S. Corzine showed signs of improvement yesterday, his doctors and aides said, eating solid food for the first time since he was seriously injured in a car accident 10 days ago, conversing with his family and watching part of the New Jersey Devils playoff hockey game on television.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine remained in critical but stable condition in the trauma intensive care unit of Cooper University Hospital in Camden, N.J., where he was receiving pain medication as he recovered from severe chest injuries, including a broken breast bone and fractured ribs, and a broken thigh bone. Mr. Corzine was on a ventilator until Friday afternoon, and has been breathing without assistance since then.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, doctors removed a drainage tube on the right side of Mr. Corzine's chest that had been inserted to clear fluid outside his lungs, according to Dr. Steven E. Ross, head of the hospital's trauma division. A second drainage tube remained in the left side of his chest.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ross said that the governor had shown signs of an upper respiratory infection, but that it had responded well to antibiotics.</p>
        <p>''He shows no evidence of any other complications,'' Dr. Ross said in a written statement, adding that he was encouraged by the governor's ability to eat solid food and talk easily with his family and the medical staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's aides said that he ate mashed potatoes with gravy yesterday and that he asked his family to turn on the Devils game, which New Jersey won, moving to the second round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's communications director, Anthony Coley, said administration officials had inquired about setting up an office in the governor's room once he recovers enough to resume his duties. Mr. Corzine is still receiving significant amounts of pain medication, according to Mr. Coley, and it is unclear when he will be able to conduct official business.</p>

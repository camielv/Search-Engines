        <p>Creationists who can carry a tune might check out the old song -- ''You Can't Make a Monkey Out of Me'' -- as it's sung with Bible-thumping fervor at the opening of the Broadway revival of ''Inherit the Wind.'' This half-century-old melodrama about populist attacks on evolution might itself be consigned fossil status but for the current events of 2007. With Darwinism still controversial for many Americans and science ever an easy target for stem-winding politicians, this play's the thing. It is a fictitious riff on the 1925 Scopes ''monkey trial'' in small-town Tennessee that attacked the teaching of evolution as an affront to literal interpretations of the Bible. It's a bracing take on Bruegelesque Americana, down to the torchlight parade of furious Christian protesters.</p>
        <p>The courtroom showcases Christopher Plummer and Brian Dennehy as stand-ins for the trial's actual antagonists, Clarence Darrow, the secularist spellbinder in defense of Darwin, and William Jennings Bryan, the sadly perennial presidential candidate Bible-quoting with a grin and playing to the crowd. For all their clashing, they are dramatized by the end as close as any two crusading humans can be. They are as beguiling, in a way, as another couple freshly arrived in New York -- the Australopithecus twosome who left their footprints in the mud of Tanzania 3.5 million years ago. This dramatic pair of antecedents are vividly recreated, with one protohuman's hairy arm draped protectively across the shoulder of the other, in a life-size tableau in the American Museum of Natural History's new exhibition on evolution. They are no less theatrical than Plummer &amp; Dennehy, packing in audiences to muse on human origins via kaleidoscopic updates from paleontology and genomics.</p>

        <p>No tough questions are ducked, right down to whether it could be humanlike art or a weird anomaly that drives each male bowerbird to dramatic extremes in building individualized, unpredictably grandiose mating nests. (''It can take years before a bowerbird wins over his audience,'' relates the video narrative, underlining performers' eternal craving to be boffo.)</p>
        <p>The DNA exhibit shows how the chimpanzee's DNA has been conclusively shown to be 98.8 percent the same as the visitor's DNA. Hey, that's no show stopper for the monkey-song chorus -- it still allows a one in 100 chance they're right.</p>

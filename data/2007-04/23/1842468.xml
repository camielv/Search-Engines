        <p>At 76 years old, George Steinbrenner does not roar the way he used to. But as the Yankees stagger into Steinbrenner's territory for a series with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, the principal owner cannot be pleased.</p>
        <p>The Boston Red Sox completed a three-game sweep of the Yankees, using five home runs to take the series finale on Sunday, 7-6, at Fenway Park. The rookie Chase Wright became the second pitcher in baseball history to allow four consecutive homers, but the Yankees actually led after he was finally removed. The fifth home run did them in.</p>
        <p>That was a three-run shot by Mike Lowell, who hit one of the homers against Wright. With no outs in the seventh, Lowell lifted a slider from Scott Proctor to a ledge just beyond the top of the Green Monster, under the light pole, for the deciding home run.</p>
        <p>It turned a one-run Yankees lead into a two-run Boston lead, and the Red Sox held on with a rolling grab by second baseman Pedroia, who robbed Josh Phelps of a game-tying hit by spearing a liner up the middle to end the top of the eighth inning.</p>
        <p>''You hate to call it a great ballgame when you lose, but that kid at second base made a great play on Phelps,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ''There's not much you can do about it.''</p>
        <p>For the Red Sox, it was all enough to make a winner of Daisuke Matsuzaka, who struck out seven but allowed six runs on eight hits in seven innings. Jonathan Papelbon earned the save by retiring Alex Rodriguez (1 for 4) on a fielder's choice grounder to end the game.</p>
        <p>''It's a little easier to enjoy when it's over,'' Red Sox Manager Terry Francona said. ''It's one of things where you say, That was cool.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees sensed a mismatch before the game, with the pricey Matsuzaka facing Wright, who was still in the minor leagues a week ago.</p>
        <p>''It'd be an enormous ballgame for us,'' Torre said. ''Obviously, with a kid going in his second major league start in Fenway Park, it doesn't seem likely. But I don't buy into it always going the way it's supposed to go in the minds of a lot of people.''</p>
        <p>What was most important, Torre said, was that the Yankees take good at-bats early against Matsuzaka. They did that in the first inning, starting with the ever-patient Bobby Abreu, who worked a two-out walk after being down in the count, 1-2.</p>
        <p>Matsuzaka then drilled Rodriguez above the left elbow with his first pitch, putting the hottest hitter in the majors on first base for Jason Giambi, who struck out three times on Saturday.</p>
        <p>This time, though, Giambi drove an outside changeup to deep left center for a double, scoring the runners to give the Yankees a 2-0 lead for the second game in a row.</p>
        <p>But, as it happened on Saturday with Jeff Karstens, a young Yankees starter could not protect the lead. The Yankees actually boosted their edge to 3-0 in the third, on a bloop single by Giambi that ticked off the glove of Dustin Pedroia, the backpedaling second baseman.</p>
        <p>But Wright earned his piece of infamy in the bottom of the inning. After two quick outs, including the dangerous David Ortiz, Wright served up a homer high into the Green Monster seats by Manny Ramírez. Three more blasts would follow.</p>
        <p>Wright got ahead of J. D. Drew, 1-2, before leaving a slider up. Drew pounded it into the stands above the Red Sox bullpen in center field. Wright turned to the scoreboard to watch the replay, but he could not avoid what happened next.</p>
        <p>Lowell smashed a 1-1 pitch over the Monster, and Jason Varitek did the same to a 1-0 pitch. Wright got a new baseball and slammed it into his glove.</p>
        <p>Only one other pitcher, Paul Foytack of the 1963 Los Angeles Angels, had ever allowed homers to four consecutive batters. But Foytack, at least, was pulled after the fourth home run.</p>
        <p>With Colter Bean just starting to loosen in the Yankees' bullpen, Wright stayed in to face Wily Mo Peña with the ballpark buzzing. The fans gasped as Peña dribbled a foul grounder -- what, not a home run? -- and Wright finally ended the barrage with a strikeout.</p>
        <p>''It was a whirlwind right there,'' Wright said. ''That's what happens when you leave pitches up in the zone. Those guys are going to do that to you.''</p>
        <p>He would face no more hitters, giving way to Bean, who pitched two scoreless innings in his fourth major league appearance. The Yankees' offense, meanwhile, dulled the impact of all those homers.</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter led off the fifth with a homer, his first of the season. It also gave Jeter a hit in 53 of his last 55 games.</p>
        <p>If he hits safely the next two nights in Tampa Bay, Jeter will have hits in 54 of 56 games, a highly unusual run of success.</p>
        <p>Joe DiMaggio hit in a record 56 consecutive games in 1941. According to Trent McCotter of the Society for American Baseball Research, only one other player has ever had two or fewer hitless games in a span of 56, Ed Delahanty for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1899.</p>
        <p>The score was tied, 4-4, and the Yankees went ahead in the sixth after Robinson Canó and Doug Mientkiewicz singled to lead off the inning. Canó scored on a double play grounder Melky Cabrera to give the Yankees a 5-4 lead.</p>
        <p>They handed it to Andy Pettitte, who worked in relief for the second time this season on a day he would normally throw in the bullpen. Pettitte pitched a scoreless sixth, but Proctor could not do the same in the seventh.</p>
        <p>When he left the game, the lead went with him, and the Red Sox soon finished off their sweep.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Hideki Matsui (hamstring) batted nine times in a simulated game in Tampa, Fla., on Sunday, and he will rejoin the Yankees for their game with the Devil Rays on Monday.  While Jorge Posada said he did not have much strength in his bruised left hand, he added that he hoped to be ready Monday.  Chase Wright became the fourth Yankee to allow four home runs in an inning, joining Randy Johnson (2005), Scott Sanderson (1992) and Catfish Hunter (1977).</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 24, 2007, Tuesday  A sports picture caption in some copies yesterday about Boston's 7-6 victory over the Yankees referred incorrectly to a home run by Mike Lowell of the Red Sox. The photograph showed the celebration after his three-run homer that put Boston ahead in the seventh inning -- not after his third-inning home run, which tied the score at 3-3.</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 25, 2007, Wednesday  A sports article in some copies on Monday about Boston's 7-6 victory over the Yankees referred incorrectly to Derek Jeter's hitting, and referred imprecisely to a home run by Manny Ramírez as part of a third-inning string of four consecutive homers by Red Sox batters. Jeter's fifth-inning home run gave him at least one hit in 52 of his last 54 regular-season games in which he had an official at-bat -- not 53 of 55 games. And the home run by Ramírez went out of Fenway Park, not high into the Green Monster seats.</p>

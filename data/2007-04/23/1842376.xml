      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>NEWSPAPER SPONSORSHIP -- Many newspapers, in the face of lost advertising revenue, have taken steps they might not have taken when times were flush. But at The Philadelphia Inquirer, even a joint venture with an advertiser that, in other times, might raise questions about editorial integrity is being rethought. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>TRIBUNE LAYOFFS -- The Tribune Company is expected to announce staffing reductions as early as today at its flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, as well as its largest circulation newspaper, The Los Angeles Times. [C6.]</p>
        <p>PC GAME RENAISSANCE -- Not so long ago, PC games were the mainstay of video gaming, but they have slumped in recent years, overshadowed by a new generation of game consoles. Now they are showing signs of a comeback. [C1.]</p>
        <p>A PRIVATE EQUITY ALTERNATIVE -- Time was that former media executives were offered consulting contracts, partnerships at private equity firms or book deals. Now, they're being offered a blank check. [C1.]</p>
        <p>IN THE BOSS'S IMAGE -- Even Warren E. Buffett does not know who will one day succeed him as chief investment officer of Berkshire Hathaway. But he, or she, will probably be a lot like Louis Simpson, who has long overseen the investment portfolio of Geico. [C1.]</p>
        <p>GREEN READING -- Buoyed by the success of ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' the film documentary of Al Gore's environmental lecture, publishers are increasing their offerings of ''green'' content, like the Washington Post's new Web site sprig.com, managed by Goli Sheikholeslami, above. E-Commerce Report: Bob Tedeschi. [C8.]</p>
        <p>FILING ELECTRONICALLY, AND LATE -- Because of a computer slowdown, thousands of users of Intuit's TurboTax software were unable to file returns at the deadline last week, raising a storm of anger and reigniting a debate over whether taxpayers should be pay fees to Intuit and other companies for handling the electronic returns in the first place. [C8.]</p>
        <p>COMMERCIAL RADIO WITHOUT ADS -- Facing increasing competition from satellite radio and iPods, Clear Channel Communications is trying something radically different at a commercial radio station in Texas: getting rid of the commercials. [C2.]</p>
        <p>DOWNLOADED MUSIC, WITH ADS -- For years, music labels have been trying to prevent fans from downloading their songs on peer-to-peer file-sharing networks. But Allan Klepfisz, left, president of a start-up called Qtrax, wants to encourage people to listen to music that way -- provided they view some advertising first. [C5.]</p>
        <p>AD CONFERENCE WRAP-UP -- A look back at some of the highlights, lowlights and sidelights of the 2007 management conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, known as the Four A's, held in Florida last week. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C7.]</p>
        <p>WIKIPEDIA AS NEWS SOURCE -- For a few days last week, the online encyclopedia Wikipedia served as a crucial news source for hundreds of thousands of people on the Internet trying to understand the shootings at Virginia Tech University. [C4.]</p>
        <p>REBUKE BY MEDICAL JOURNAL -- The New England Journal of Medicine has reportedly banned a prominent Columbia University cardiologist from reviewing submissions by other researchers or having his own commentary published. [C6.]</p>
        <p>BACK IN PRINT -- Three months after two journalists left The Washington Post to start a new-media venture, their political coverage has found its way back to a national newspaper -- USA Today. [C6.]</p>

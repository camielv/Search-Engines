        <p>Three months after two journalists left The Washington Post to start a new-media venture, their political coverage has found its way back to a national newspaper: USA Today.</p>
        <p>USA Today said Friday that it would begin using articles produced by the start-up, The Politico, a mostly online news operation staffed by journalists who have worked for news outlets like Time, The Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press.</p>

        <p>Three months after two journalists left The Washington Post to start a new-media venture, their political coverage has found its way back to a national newspaper: USA Today.</p>
        <p>USA Today said Friday that it would begin using articles produced by the start-up, The Politico, a mostly online news operation staffed by journalists who have worked for news outlets like Time, The Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>USAToday.com has already added a scroll box with Politico headlines on its Political News  page; clicking on a headline takes a reader to the article on Politico.com. Kinsey Wilson, co-executive editor of USA Today, said that starting today The Politico would also provide at least 15 articles a week for the newspaper's Web pages, and occasionally for its printed editions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson, who used to be editor in chief of the paper's Web site, emphasized that the arrangement was not a cost-cutting effort. USA Today, published by Gannett, is the biggest paper in the country by circulation, but its newsroom is set up to put out a paper only five days a week, he said. ''We need to deepen our coverage online, where there is an expectation of 24-hour timeliness,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If the paper's Washington reporters are worried about being upstaged by writers with bigger bylines, they are not saying; phone messages left for six of them on Friday were not returned.</p>
        <p>Kathy Kiely, who covers Congress for USA Today, said she did not feel threatened. ''I think it's a plus for the paper,'' she said, adding, ''This is a time when a lot of publications are cutting back on their reporting resources, so the idea that we would be adding resources, even indirectly, is a wonderful thing.''</p>
        <p>Jim VandeHei, The Politico's executive editor who founded the venture with John F. Harris, a colleague from The Post, said that the deal gave his 25 reporters a forum to reach readers ''not just inside the Beltway, but coast to coast.'' USAToday.com attracts more than nine million visitors a month, according to Nielsen/NetRatings.</p>

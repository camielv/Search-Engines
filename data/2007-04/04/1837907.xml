        <p>Two representatives from Spalding were at the Nets' practice facility yesterday as players tested the company's synthetic basketballs.</p>
        <p>The N.B.A. started this season with a new synthetic ball that players complained was too slippery and gave them cuts on their hands. The league switched back to the traditional leather ball in January.</p>
        <p>Nets point guard Jason Kidd, one of the biggest critics of the synthetic ball used earlier in the season, seemed pleased that the league was looking for input.</p>
        <p>Still, Kidd was not necessarily a fan of change. ''Anytime you get equipment change and you've been in the league for a while, you hope they wait until after you're done,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sixteen teams have tested the new balls, but the N.B.A. is expected to stick with the leather ball next season.</p>

        <p>Mike Conley Sr., the father of Ohio State's Mike Conley Jr. and the probable agent for his son's teammates Greg Oden and Daequan Cook, said that the three freshmen would probably decide in the next two weeks whether they would leave early to enter the N.B.A. draft.</p>
        <p>Conley Sr. said that he had not talked to the three players or to Ohio State Coach Thad Matta since the Buckeyes lost to Florida, 84-75, in the N.C.A.A. title game Monday night.</p>

        <p>Oden is projected as the No. 1 overall pick. Conley and Cook, who was not even a starter for the Buckeyes, are projected as possible first-round picks. They have until midnight April 28 to declare.</p>
        <p>Conley Sr. said that his son had maintained that he would not leave college until he was a probable lottery pick, which they figured would take at least three years.</p>

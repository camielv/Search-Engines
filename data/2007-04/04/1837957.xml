        <p>After more than 100 years, Lodge, a maker of cast-iron cookware, has added a new line, the Signature Series, with stainless steel handles. That may not sound like much, but it means that the handles stay cooler for stovetop cooking and that the look is more 21st-century.</p>
        <p>The performance of the pans is everything you expect from cast iron and they are every bit as heavy as the regular Lodge pans. The line includes Dutch ovens (4.5- and 7-quart $129.95 and $149.95), a 2.5-quart covered casserole ($129.95), straight-sided skillets that are more like sauté pans (10 and 12 inches, $89.95 and $99.95), and a 12-inch grill pan ($109.95).</p>

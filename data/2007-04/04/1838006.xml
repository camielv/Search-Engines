        <p>This year, the New Jersey Senate is facing its biggest turnover in two decades, with nearly a third of its 40 members saying they plan to retire.</p>
        <p>But when the senators do leave Trenton, they will take not just their years of public service with them, but in some cases a pension that has been inflated by other public jobs.</p>
        <p>At least 5 of the 12 retiring senators have held other government jobs at the same time as their legislative posts, which currently pay $49,000 a year -- potentially qualifying them for additional pension pay.</p>
        <p>The most prominent is Sen. Wayne R. Bryant, a Camden County Democrat, who on Tuesday appeared for the first time in Federal District Court here to face corruption charges. One of the charges is that he stockpiled government jobs requiring little or no work over the past three years to increase his pension to about $81,000 from $28,000.</p>
        <p>Holding multiple government jobs is hardly uncommon in New Jersey, with its patchwork of hundreds of municipal and county governments, school districts and regional authorities. And the total fiscal impact of those multiple pensions is minuscule compared with the system's multibillion-dollar shortfall, which stems from a dearth of state contributions coupled with some questionable financial practices over the past decade.</p>
        <p>But the widespread practice of state and local workers in New Jersey holding multiple jobs that increase their pensions is still, some analysts say, a troubling example of the state's overly generous pension rules. And some good-government watchdogs assert that as long as state legislators are among those receiving such enhanced benefits, they will have a vested interest in preventing serious changes to the strained system.</p>
        <p>''We need to build a culture of service as opposed to political careerism where politicians sometimes leverage political power into personal private gain,'' said Heather Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Citizens' Campaign, a nonprofit advocacy group.</p>
        <p>As it stands, 21 of 120 legislators now hold other elected positions, and 15 others hold other government jobs, according to legislative researchers in Trenton. In some other places, public wrath has boiled over when legislators approved increases that would also fatten their own pensions. In Milwaukee County, officials who decided to increase pensions for county employees -- themselves included -- were forced to resign. An aide who helped devise the package pleaded no contest to charges of misrepresenting the pensions' cost, paid a fine and served a short sentence in a work-release facility.</p>
        <p>In San Diego, the city attorney, Michael Aguirre, has been trying to nullify hundreds of millions of dollars worth of pension benefits, which he says were illegally approved by pension officials who stood to receive the increases themselves. A conflict-of-interest law in California prohibits officials from having a financial interest in any contracts that they make in their official capacities.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, none of the retiring legislators who have had multiple jobs returned calls on Tuesday to talk about the pension system.</p>
        <p>There is Senator Martha W. Bark, a Burlington County Republican, who is, according to published reports, under investigation by the attorney general's office into allegations that she held two no-show county jobs that paid her $330,000 over six years.</p>
        <p>There is Sen. Joseph V. Doria Jr., a Democrat who is also the longtime mayor of Bayonne. He makes $72,000 a year from his municipal job, according to state payroll records.</p>
        <p>Two other retiring senators, Robert J. Martin, a Republican from Morris County, and Leonard T. Connors Jr., a Republican from Ocean County, have had other government jobs, but not for much additional pay.</p>
        <p>Still, another prominent senator may soon join them: Sharpe James, who is eligible for a public pension from his long tenure as the mayor of Newark. Mr James also works as an administrator for Essex County College. Federal agents have been investigating Mr. James's use of city-issued credit cards to cover travel expenses for himself, his bodyguards and other city officials when he was mayor.</p>
        <p>In the Assembly, two of the seven who have said that they will retire this year have had other government jobs in their careers -- including Assemblyman Charles T. Epps Jr., a Democrat who is the superintendent of schools in Jersey City.</p>
        <p>Mr. Epps, who made $207,000 in 2005 from his schools job, was elected in 2005, but has been criticized by school board members and others for being unable to devote as much time as necessary to the state-run district.</p>

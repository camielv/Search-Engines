        <p>Elizabeth Edwards, who began her cancer treatments late last week, said Tuesday evening that she had received encouraging news from her physician and was determined not to let public curiosity and concern over her illness overshadow her husband's presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>''I honestly believe in candor and in full disclosure, transparency and all that stuff,'' Mrs. Edwards, 57, said in an interview here. ''On the other hand, at some point, it becomes an impediment to getting the actual message across.''</p>

        <p>Elizabeth Edwards, who began her cancer treatments late last week, said Tuesday evening that she had received encouraging news from her physician and was determined not to let public curiosity and concern over her illness overshadow her husband's presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>''I honestly believe in candor and in full disclosure, transparency and all that stuff,'' Mrs. Edwards, 57, said in an interview here. ''On the other hand, at some point, it becomes an impediment to getting the actual message across.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks after announcing that her cancer had returned, John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat, and his wife made their first trip back to Iowa. They barely mentioned her illness during a public forum with nearly 1,000 voters at a Cedar Rapids high school, but Mrs. Edwards discussed her treatment regimen after the campaign event.</p>
        <p>After visiting her doctor last Friday in Chapel Hill, N.C., Mrs. Edwards said she learned that her cancer was more likely than previously expected to be controlled by drugs that control excessive hormone levels. She said that her doctor initially believed she had a ''triple negative'' form of cancer, which would be harder to treat this way, but that additional testing revealed otherwise.</p>
        <p>''It was very good news,'' Mrs. Edwards said, talking Tuesday about her treatment for the first time. ''It means that the available medicines to treat me are a larger buffet.''</p>
        <p>Sitting in a home economics room here, she pointed to a dark bruise on her left hand, from her first intravenous treatment on Friday. She is taking Femara, an aromatase inhibitor, she said, and her regimen consists of a daily pill and a monthly, 15-minute IV treatment. She is also part of a medical research study.</p>
        <p>Since announcing their decision to continue with Mr. Edwards's presidential bid, she said she feared that the campaign message could be overtaken by questions of her health. So she wrote a posting on the campaign blog this week, thanking her admirers for their concern, but asking them to turn their attention to advocating for cancer research or improving health care policy.</p>
        <p>At the campaign event here, where people waved signs expressing their support for her, Mrs. Edwards did not discuss her illness. She urged Iowa voters, who open the presidential nominating season next January, to ''pay attention to what the candidates are saying.''</p>
        <p>''I'll be constantly trying to change the subject to the bigger issues,'' Mrs. Edwards said, a smile growing across her face. ''I don't just want to be the wife with cancer.''</p>

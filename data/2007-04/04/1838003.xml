        <p>The Justice Department took steps yesterday to shut down a big piece of the Jackson Hewitt tax-preparation empire, charging that more than 165 of its stores enabled tens of thousands of middle- and lower-income people to fraudulently obtain $70 million by falsifying their federal tax returns.</p>
        <p>The agency filed four related civil lawsuits seeking to halt business at the stores, which are franchises in Detroit, Chicago, Atlanta and the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina. Their principal owner and operator is a Pakistani-born businessman, Farrukh Sohail.</p>
        <p>While the lawsuits do not name the corporate headquarters of Jackson Hewitt Tax Services as a defendant, they raise questions about oversight by the publicly traded company of one of its largest franchisees.</p>
        <p>Based in Parsippany, N.J., Jackson Hewitt is the nation's second-largest income tax preparer, after H&amp;R Block, and promotes itself as a low-cost tax return service.</p>
        <p>Operators of franchises prepare returns using Jackson Hewitt's ''Profiler'' software and then send the returns to the main Jackson Hewitt center for approval and filing to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
        <p>Asked yesterday at a news conference if the I.R.S. was investigating other parts of Jackson Hewitt, Mark Everson, the I.R.S. commissioner, said that ''what we're talking about today speaks only to these five entities,'' referring to the five corporations wholly or partly owned by Mr. Sohail that ran the more than 165 franchises.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department filed the four lawsuits in federal courts in Michigan, Illinois, North Carolina and Georgia, naming the five corporations, Mr. Sohail and an additional 24 employees as defendants, including Mr. Sohail's wife, Saher.</p>
        <p>The corporations named were So Far Inc., which runs about 55 outlets in the Detroit area; Smart Tax of North Carolina, with more than 30 outlets in the Raleigh-Durham area; Smart Tax of Georgia, with more than 40 outlets in the Atlanta area; and Smart Tax and Ask Tax of Illinois, with nearly 30 franchises in the Chicago area. A Justice Department news release said more than 125 retail outlets owned by Mr. Sohail were involved, but the actual number, as detailed in the complaints, is 166.</p>
        <p>Notably, the Georgia complaint suggests that Jackson Hewitt was at least somewhat aware of what was going on. It says that in 2005 Mr. Sohail ''was visited by a Jackson Hewitt Tax Services Inc. employee, who informed Sohail that Santa Barbara Bank had told Jackson Hewitt corporate headquarters that Sohail's Smart Tax/Jackson Hewitt stores were filing too many fraudulent returns.''</p>
        <p>Jackson Hewitt did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment. The company's shares plunged 18 percent yesterday, or $5.87, to $26.53.</p>
        <p>The I.R.S. and Justice Department typically increase their crackdown on fraudulent tax-return preparers close to the federal filing deadline, which is April 17 this year.</p>
        <p>But the concerted move against the franchises owned by Mr. Sohail, which the Justice Department described in a statement as having engaged in ''a pervasive and massive series of tax fraud schemes,'' is unusually large and sweeping. His outlets prepared over 105,000 returns last year, many of them fraudulent, the agency said. The Justice Department is seeking court orders to shut the stores under investigation.</p>
        <p>They are part of the Jackson Hewitt empire of 6,500 outlets, which prepared a total of 3.7 million tax returns last year. Founded in 1982, Jackson Hewitt was acquired by Cendant, the franchiser of Days Inn motels and Century 21 real estate office, in 1998 -- the year Mr. Sohail opened his first Jackson Hewitt franchise, in Detroit -- as Cendant was embroiled in a huge fraud. It became a publicly traded company in 2004</p>
        <p>The lawsuits cite poor training, scant oversight and the ignoring of whistle-blowers at Mr. Sohail's stores. They also describe a factory-like atmosphere where employees were encouraged to churn out returns in exchange for bribes, to accept scant or false documents like W-2 forms and to falsify taxpayer data needed to receive the earned- income tax credit, a federal assistance program.</p>
        <p>In one Chicago store, a 14-year-old girl was hired as a ''recruiter'' to drum up business, according to the Illinois complaint. Also in a Chicago outlet, returns were filed for homeless customers with no income or withholdings and people with undocumented Social Security numbers, the Illinois complaint stated.</p>
        <p>A Chicago outlet also abused the fuel tax credit, in one case filing a 2004 federal return for a barber who earned $14,000 but claimed a $50,000 tax credit for 25,000 gallons of fuel. The customer ''would have driven 500,000 business miles during the year -- which comes to 1,370 miles each day, seven days a week, leaving little if any time to cut any hair,'' the Illinois complaint said. A Georgia outlet removed all photocopiers, preventing the copying and verification of documents like W-2s, as a cost-cutting measure.</p>
        <p>The complaints quoted Mr. Sohail as saying that his return preparers ''are only short term.''</p>
        <p>''All they need is to be able to do data entry. A monkey can do this.''</p>
        <p>Efforts to reach Mr. Sohail, who federal officials said lived in Atlanta, were not successful. The agency also declined to comment upon why franchises he owned in Birmingham, Ala., were not sued.</p>
        <p>Jackson Hewitt has grown unusually fast, nearly doubling in size over the last five years thanks to its business model of granting licenses for independently owned and operated franchises like those of Mr. Sohail.</p>
        <p>''A key factor in our growth is the emphasis we place on recruiting, training, developing and supporting our franchisees,'' the company says on its Web site.</p>
        <p>Mr. Everson said that ''larger entities have an obligation to set a standard'' for their franchisees. The Justice Department and the I.R.S. have in the past held larger entities, including the accounting firm KPMG and the law firm of Jenkens &amp; Gilchrist, now defunct, responsible for the tax-related violations of their subsidiaries, affiliates or branch offices.</p>

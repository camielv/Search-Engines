        <p>Editorial warns that deterioration of Chicago's elevated train system threatens city's quality of life and economy; says public officials across country must balance forbidding upfront cost of financing mass transit against long-term and extremely diffuse benefits; says Congress should raise federal gas tax, which contributes money for public transporation systems, at a minimum bringing it in line with inflation</p>

        <p>Americans made 10.1 billion trips on public transportation last year, the highest that ridership has risen in nearly half a century. That's good for congestion on the roads as well as the pollution that goes with it. But any mass-transit renaissance will come to a grinding halt unless a commensurate investment is made in upkeep and expansion.</p>
        <p>As Libby Sander reported recently in The Times, Chicago's elevated train system, known as the El, appears to be near a breaking point. The second-largest public transit system in America after New York's is suffering from rising commute times as the century-old system deteriorates.</p>
        <p>Public transit systems are financed through a combination of federal and local money, so parochial priorities play a big role in underinvestment. For instance, the Chicago Transit Authority's financing formula hasn't changed since 1983. But at the same time, the federal gas tax -- which contributes money for public transportation systems as well as highways -- hasn't changed since 1993. That means it hasn't even kept up with inflation in maintenance and construction costs, much less rising demand.</p>
        <p>Part of the trouble with financing for mass transit is that the upfront costs always appear prohibitively large (for the next five years, Chicago's regional authority is seeking $10 billion in state and local money) while the benefits are long term and extremely diffuse. As a result, projects often linger. Planners have been trying to build New York's Second Avenue Line since the 1920s.</p>
        <p>Worse still, when money is scarce it is insidiously easy to delay maintenance.</p>
        <p>Once a system begins to break down, it can hurt the quality of life and economic growth of a city. And it isn't just a problem for city dwellers. Buses and rail systems serve rural areas as well. Government officials around the country should take heed of Chicago's problems. Meanwhile, Congress should at a minimum bring the gas tax in line with inflation.</p>

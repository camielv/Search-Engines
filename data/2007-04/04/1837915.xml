        <p>The body of a missing Newark woman was found inside a metal garbage can in a vacant lot near a construction site on Brookdale Avenue on Monday night, the Essex County prosecutor's office said yesterday. Relatives reported the woman, Kasie DeJarnette, 38, missing last month, said Paul M. Loriquet, a spokesman for the prosecutor. She appeared to have died from asphyxiation, he said, but the case would not be ruled a homicide until after a medical examiner's evaluation.</p>

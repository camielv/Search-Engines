        <p>LLOYD C. BLANKFEIN, the head of Goldman Sachs, may be the highest-paid executive on Wall Street, but on the golf greens, he is just another humble hacker.</p>
        <p>Golf is a favorite pastime of the finance crowd, offering not just an escape from the office but a chance for open-air networking and friendly competition. As spring summons many of the power hitters to the fairway, a look at their golf handicaps suggests that some will be spending much more time in the sand traps than others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blankfein's handicap index is 32.1, according to the United States Golf Association. A lower handicap indicates a better golf game, and Mr. Blankfein's rating is well above those of the chiefs at rival firms like Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers.</p>
        <p>At the opposite end is Eric Gleacher, chairman of Gleacher Partners. At a toothpick-thin 2.2, Mr. Gleacher's handicap is one of the lowest on Wall Street. ''I have been playing competitive golf since I was 13,'' he said, adding that he plays as often as he can, but mainly on weekends. ''I work full time.''</p>
        <p>The golf association computes handicap indexes based on players' scores from clubs nationwide, adjusted to reflect the relative difficulty of each course. The scores are publicly available on the Web through the association's Golf Handicap Information Network.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gleacher is a member at four exclusive courses on Long Island: Maidstone Club in East Hampton; National Golf Links of America and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, both in Southampton; and Deepdale Golf Club in Manhasset.</p>
        <p>Through a spokesman, Mr. Blankfein, who belongs to the East Hampton Country Club and the Manhattan Woods Country Club in West Nyack, N.Y., declined to comment on his game. The spokesman said he did not even know that Mr. Blankfein golfed.</p>
        <p>Theodore J. Forstmann (right), of the private investment firm Forstmann Little &amp; Company and chairman of the sports and media marketer IMG, has long been known as a top golfer on Wall Street, and is a friend of the professional Vijay Singh.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Maounis, former head of Amaranth Advisors, may be out of practice. Since his hedge fund collapsed last fall, he hasn't registered a round with the U.S.G.A.</p>

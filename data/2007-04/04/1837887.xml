        <p>About two thousand lawyers and opposition supporters chanting ''Go, Musharraf!'' and other slogans against President Pervez Musharraf protested outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad as the country's suspended chief justice, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, left, appeared before a panel of judges to defend himself on charges of misuse of power. Similar protests were held in other cities. The panel adjourned the private proceedings until April 13. Mr. Chaudhry's lawyers urged an open hearing. Demonstrations and lawyers' strikes have erupted around the country since General Musharraf's decision on March 9 to suspend the independent-minded Mr. Chaudhry. Opponents say General Musharraf suspended him to weaken the judiciary. At the protest in Islamabad, flags of an alliance of religious parties and flags of the political parties of the exiled prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif fluttered in abundance.</p>

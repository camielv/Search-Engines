        <p>GANESHA, the multiarmed, one-tusked, elephant-headed son of Shiva, is one of the most beloved gods in the Hindu pantheon and the presiding deity at the Hindu Temple Society of North America in Flushing, Queens.</p>
        <p>The temple society (Sri Maha Vallabha Ganapati Devasthanam) and community center have been hubs for many Hindus in this part of the world since 1977. The center has halls for weddings, an auditorium (where I recently caught a Balinese dance concert) and, in the basement, a canteen serving some of the best dosas in the city.</p>
        <p>Dr. Uma Mysorekar, the president of the temple, said the canteen began in 1993 when a special cook was hired to prepare the naivedyams, the food offerings to the deities, which are a part of every temple ritual. Soon enough the chef was cooking for devotees who would spend the entire day at the temple. Now, the canteen is open to anyone. Weeknight crowds are sparse, but the place is packed all day on weekends.</p>
        <p>It is amazing what the cooks can conjure up with little more than lentil-rice flour, loads of butter and a giant, searing hot griddle. Tubular paper dosas are vellum thin and shatteringly crisp. As long as a grown man's arm, they are bigger even than the cafeteria-style plastic trays that are provided for ferrying the food from counter to table.</p>
        <p>Pondicherry dosas are folded into flat, equilateral triangles much bigger than the plates they are served on. The regular pondicherry dosa is stuffed with a thin layer of delicious mustard-seed-flecked potato mush, the pondicherry masala dosa with an invigorating mix of cilantro leaves and sliced green chilies that pack a lip-numbing punch. (The mango lassis are excellent coolants should a flash of chili heat blindside you.)</p>
        <p>Mysore dosas are packed with melted onions and mushed cauliflower -- an appreciation of south Indian cuisine requires a love of mush -- and have a folded crepe-like shape. So do the onion-packed onion rava dosas. (An affinity for onions must go along with that mush love.)</p>
        <p>The butter dosa is topped with a sizable knob of unmelted butter. But I'll save my death-by-dairy calories for the ghee roast, the best of the distinguished dosa lineup and, Dr. Mysorekar noted, a canteen specialty.</p>
        <p>Shaped like a dunce cap and standing about a foot off the plate, it is crisp and pliant at the same time and more buttery than butter, enough so that when you tear off pieces (right hand only, please) your fingers will glisten with ghee.</p>
        <p>All dosas -- in fact, most of the dishes on the sprawling menu -- are served with a mild coconut chutney and a faintly spicy sambar. (Do not -- do not -- let your friends goad you into tasting one of the giant chilies you may find in your sambar.)</p>
        <p>The sambar with the pancake-like uttapams (mixed vegetable, tomato or onion and chili) is sweeter, and loaded with potatoes and peas.</p>
        <p>The chutneys and sambars never made me swoon, but friends who just returned from a trip that included three months in southern India assured me they were on par with what they ate at temples there.</p>
        <p>Other dishes can be hit or miss. I'm sure the samosas would be better fresh from the deep fryer. But it feels piddling to complain when the dosas are so good, the food so inexpensive (nothing is more than $5.50) and the volunteer staff so welcoming to dosa-eating outsiders.</p>
        <p>Except for the statue of Ganesha opposite the kitchen, the canteen reminded me of the church basement where I was supposed to be absorbing the tenets of Catholicism as a child. The friend who told me about the canteen said it reminded him of the Hebrew school he attended in Toronto.</p>
        <p>If the canteen is short on ambiance, the temple isn't. It is filled with arresting smells -- the incense is strong -- and beautiful flower-draped shrines to pot-bellied Ganesha on his lotus flower throne. I watched a man crack coconuts for offerings at a designated coconut-breaking station. Break open the coconut and break open your ego, the thinking goes, making you more open to God.</p>
        <p>It was almost all too much to take in. Almost. My one-handed dosa-tearing technique needs work. I don't speak a lick of Tamil.</p>
        <p>But I did pick up ''Prasadam: Food of the Hindu Gods'' at the temple bookstore to help me get a handle on what festivals are held when and what specialties the kitchen will be preparing for them. Because with everyday dosas this good, I'd love to see what is served at a party.</p>
        <p>Temple Canteen  Hindu Temple Society of North America, 143-09 Holly Avenue (Bowne Street), Flushing, Queens; (718) 460-8493.</p>
        <p>BEST DISHES -- Dosas, particularly the ghee roast, paper, pondicherry and mysore masala.</p>
        <p>PRICE RANGE -- 50 cents to $5.50.</p>
        <p>CREDIT CARDS -- All major cards.</p>
        <p>HOURS -- 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily.</p>
        <p>WHEELCHAIR ACCESS -- Accessible through the Smart Street entrance, which leads to an elevator. (Signage at the temple is more than thorough.)</p>

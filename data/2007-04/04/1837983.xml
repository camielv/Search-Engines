        <p>What is so impressive about Matthew Dowd's public confession of having misplaced his faith in the president is that it highlights the fact that George W. Bush does not and will not admit to any mistakes on his part. It also highlights the paradox in democracy.</p>

        <p>Re ''Ex-Aide Details a Loss of Faith in the President'' (front page, April 1):</p>
        <p>What is so impressive about Matthew Dowd's public confession of having misplaced his faith in the president is that it highlights the fact that George W. Bush does not and will not admit to any mistakes on his part. It also highlights the paradox in democracy.</p>
        <p>We want a leader to lead and to attend to the will of the people at the same time. But you cannot have it both ways. Mr. Bush has certainly been a leader. But what do you do when the leadership is flawed?</p>
        <p>In England, the party in power can be immediately voted out by Parliament when confidence in it has been lost. But here we have to wait four or six years until we can change the government. In that time, a lot of damage can be and has been done.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Matthew Dowd's emotional pain could be felt through the printed word. His loss of faith speaks to our being more cautious, questioning and staying informed to prevent blind following of any politician.</p>
        <p>He spoke of working for more gentleness in the election process. I would just be happy with honesty that stays with issues versus character assassination.</p>

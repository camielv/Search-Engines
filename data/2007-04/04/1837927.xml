        <p>FEW FIRMS exemplified the previous deal-making boom better than Drexel Burnham Lambert, whose rise and fall in the 1980s was described by James B. Stewart in ''Den of Thieves.'' While that era was marked by criminal prosecutions, notably of Michael R. Milken and Ivan F. Boesky, not all of the players were ''thieves.'' Many know that Mr. Milken has become a philanthropist supporting cancer research, and that Rudolph W. Giuliani, who prosecuted him, is running for president. Here are others from Mr. Stewart's book, with updates:</p>
        <p>Martin A. Siegel  PRISON, AND A STALLED RETURN  As an investment banker, he was a star at Kidder Peabody, then Drexel, before pleading guilty to conspiracy and tax evasion. He received a two-month prison sentence, thanks to his cooperation with the government. He resurfaced in the mid-1990s as an adviser to the Ideon Group. But when the board found out about the hire, it insisted that his contract not be renewed.</p>
        <p>Herald L. Ritch  NEVER LEFT THE GAME  Then a rising star, he is now a veteran in mergers and acquisitions. In 1988, he joined Freeman Spogli and then served as a top executive at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. He left D.L.J. in 2000, shortly after Credit Suisse acquired it, leading a contingent of defectors to Salomon Smith Barney. He is now president and co-chief executive of Sagent Advisors, a boutique bank.</p>
        <p>Ivan F. Boesky  A LIFE OF SECLUSION  His $100 million fine for insider trading has never been surpassed. He served two years in a federal prison after cooperating with prosecutors. In 1993, Mr. Boesky and his wife divorced, and he lost his Westchester County mansion and Park Avenue apartment. Reclusive, he has been seen in New York, France and Switzerland.</p>
        <p>James Dahl  AN ACTIVIST INVESTOR  He made a plea agreement with prosecutors. Leaving Drexel in 1990, he moved back to Jacksonville, Fla., his hometown, and set up an investment firm. He was back in the spotlight in the late 1990s through his activism at Gehl, a construction company, after he was refused a board seat. Gehl finally bought his 10 percent stake for $14.9 million.</p>
        <p>Gary Winnick  GLOBAL CROSSING AND AN IMPERIAL LIFESTYLE  After leaving Drexel in 1985, he founded the Pacific Capital Group, an investment firm. He then founded Global Crossing, a telecommunications darling of the late 1990s. But the company's fortunes crumbled, culminating in a bankruptcy filing in 2002. Mr. Winnick's imperial lifestyle -- and the lengths he went to preserve it -- angered employees and investors alike. An investigation by the S.E.C. was concluded without any charges against him.</p>
        <p>Dennis B. Levine  AFTER PRISON, CONSULTING  He made a deal with prosecutors that resulted in a two-year prison term on perjury, securities fraud and tax evasion charges. When he left prison in 1988, he was barred from associating with broker-dealers. Later, he founded the Adasar Group, a consulting firm named after his two children.</p>
        <p>Peter J. Solomon  WALL STREET WISE MAN  Mr. Levine's mentor at Shearson Lehman Brothers, Mr. Solomon left the firm in 1989 to hang his own shingle, the Peter J. Solomon Company. He has since become one of Wall Street's gray eminences. His firm has recently advised on deals that include Kate Spade, Lands' End and Barneys New York.</p>
        <p>Lawrence B. Pedowitz  REPRESENTED MARTHA STEWART  Still a partner at the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz. But his post-Milken highlight may be his role on Martha Stewart's defense team. With a partner, John Savarese, he helped negotiate a deal with federal prosecutors: Ms. Stewart would plead guilty to one felony count of making a false statement to federal agents, according to a 2004 New Yorker article. Ms. Stewart did not take the deal, went to trial and ended up being convicted.</p>
        <p>Harvey Pitt  SERVED AS S.E.C. CHAIRMAN  In 2001, he was appointed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, leading it during Sept. 11, the collapse of Enron and the wave of scandals that led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. But he resigned in 2003 amid controversy over one of his appointments. He is now runs Kalorama Partners, a consulting firm.</p>
        <p>Linda Gosden Robinson  STILL IN PUBLIC RELATIONS  She was Mr. Milken's spokeswoman in the 1980s. As chairwoman of Robinson Lerer &amp; Montgomery, she has represented clients like Pfizer and Morgan Stanley. Her firm was acquired by Young &amp; Rubicam, which itself was then bought by the WPP Group of Britain. She also serves as a director of Revlon and BlackRock.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Lerer  INTERNET EXECUTIVE  He quickly moved from representing business moguls to becoming one himself. While still president of Robinson Lerer &amp; Montgomery, he became senior vice president of America Online, and then an executive vice president of Time Warner. He has since moved to newer media: in 2005, he co-founded the Huffington Post Web site with Arianna Huffington.</p>

        <p>Introduced on Wednesday: 2007 Mercedes-Benz CLK63 AMG Black Series</p>
        <p>Is it real? A version of the CLK63 AMG Black Series is the current safety car for Formula One. This one just doesn't have the decals and flashing lights.</p>
        <p>What's the point? While AMG is celebrating its 40th year, the company is also taking advantage of its involvement in Formula One, the most technologically advanced racing series in the world.</p>
        <p>What they said: "It has a completely new suspension and a 2.8-inch wider track than the standard CLK," said Volker Mornhinweg, chairman of AMG. "And thanks to all of these modifications and more, it can accelerate from 0-to-60 in 4.1 seconds and hit 186 miles an hour."</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: Feeling the heat from other luxury automakers, which are churning out ultraperformance models faster than you can say NÃ¼rburgring, AMG is clearly beating its chest. Later this year, it will introduce a new marketing strategy to broaden its consumer base.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? The CLK63 Black Series has a lusty 6.3-liter V-8 that's been groomed to a make a scorching 500 horsepower. It is the first engine designed completely by AMG.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? Only 500 are planned for production with a reserve of 200 more. With that kind of exclusivity, you can expect prices lofting up toward six figures when the CLK63 Black Series hits showrooms in July.</p>
        <p>How's it look? While it may be a street version of the Formula One safety car, the whole Black Series get-up -- sharply angled fender flares in the front and back and a carbon-fiber overload -- will probably look much more at home on the racetrack.</p>

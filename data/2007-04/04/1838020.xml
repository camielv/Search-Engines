        <p>Three years after Arnold Palmer retired from playing the Masters, he will stand on the first tee Thursday and hit a drive as the tournament's honorary starter. Palmer, a four-time champion, played in 50 consecutive tournaments after making his first appearance in 1955.</p>
        <p>''I think the time has come,'' Palmer, 77, said. ''My competitive golf is done. I have no intentions of playing competitively on the Tour. I hope in some way I can show my gratitude to the fans who have followed and supported me these many years.''</p>

        <p>Three years after Arnold Palmer retired from playing the Masters, he will stand on the first tee Thursday and hit a drive as the tournament's honorary starter. Palmer, a four-time champion, played in 50 consecutive tournaments after making his first appearance in 1955.</p>
        <p>''I think the time has come,'' Palmer, 77, said. ''My competitive golf is done. I have no intentions of playing competitively on the Tour. I hope in some way I can show my gratitude to the fans who have followed and supported me these many years.''</p>
        <p>Billy Payne, the Augusta chairman, said, ''We are absolutely delighted that Arnold Palmer will once again be on the first tee at Augusta, a place where he belongs, and among thousands that traced their love of the game to his inspiration.''</p>
        <p>The tradition of an honorary starter began in 1963 and has been performed by six players -- Jock Hutchison, Fred McLeod, Byron Nelson, Gene Sarazen, Ken Venturi and Sam Snead.</p>
        <p>Asked if he might be tempted to hit his tee shot and keep on playing, Palmer said: ''You know, I'm not too smart, but I'm not stupid. I think I'll just let it go wherever it goes.''</p>

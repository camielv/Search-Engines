We wish to extend our heartfelt sympathy to his loving wife, Frances, devoted son, Kenneth, and his entire family. Mr. A., as he was affectionately called, was a true gentleman and taught us the value of respect. He was a man of strong moral character and continually reinforced the notion that good, honesty and truthfulness would always prevail.

However, tomorrow will never be the same. Mr. A. was one of a kind. It was a privilege to have known him. Rest in peace, ''Chief''.

        <p>Biographical solo plays are usually conceived as star vehicles -- feats of impersonation by gifted chameleons who elicit the pleasure of recognition by channeling famous subjects. By contrast, ''Did You Used to Be R. D. Laing?'' is a solo show whose subject -- the controversial Scottish psychiatrist Ronald David Laing -- has largely faded from public view, starring an actor who doesn't impersonate him.</p>
        <p>Laing was an international celebrity in the late 1960s. His books questioning orthodox psychiatric practices sold in the millions, and the experimental ''safe house'' clinics he founded and inspired (in which patients could ''journey'' through their mental illnesses undisturbed by intrusive treatments) were lightning rods for effusive acclaim and scorn. Laing eventually became a guru to innumerable self-indulgent and self-congratulatory followers who distorted his ideas by calling the mad insane and the insane mad, and he did little to repair his image with his frequent drinking binges and flagrant thirst for publicity.</p>

        <p>Biographical solo plays are usually conceived as star vehicles -- feats of impersonation by gifted chameleons who elicit the pleasure of recognition by channeling famous subjects. By contrast, ''Did You Used to Be R. D. Laing?'' is a solo show whose subject -- the controversial Scottish psychiatrist Ronald David Laing -- has largely faded from public view, starring an actor who doesn't impersonate him.</p>
        <p>Laing was an international celebrity in the late 1960s. His books questioning orthodox psychiatric practices sold in the millions, and the experimental ''safe house'' clinics he founded and inspired (in which patients could ''journey'' through their mental illnesses undisturbed by intrusive treatments) were lightning rods for effusive acclaim and scorn. Laing eventually became a guru to innumerable self-indulgent and self-congratulatory followers who distorted his ideas by calling the mad insane and the insane mad, and he did little to repair his image with his frequent drinking binges and flagrant thirst for publicity.</p>
        <p>Mike Maran, the Scottish actor who wrote, directed and stars in this 90-minute show, explores Laing's life and work from the perspective of an unnamed genial admirer who says he has just come from Laing's funeral in 1989. A balding, portly actor sporting a bright red jacket and a wispy beard, Mr. Maran pours himself generous glasses of whiskey while telling stories about ''Ronnie'' dating to his lonely childhood and skeptical years in medical school.</p>
        <p>Who this character is to Laing is never quite clear, but since his main purpose is conveying information, the vague identity doesn't matter much. The show is set to a lovely, recorded piano score by David Milligan, and its tone is modest, tranquil and affectionate, carefully avoiding positive or negative exaggeration.</p>
        <p>The disadvantage of such an empathetic and fair-minded approach is that it leaves the audience clueless about why Laing was an object of passionate disagreement. The tales of alcoholic antics and broken marriages notwithstanding, the play's very pleasantness keeps its prickly subject in an ill-fitting soft focus. We hear tantalizing suggestions of mental illness in Laing's mother, for instance, but few details, general references to his professional enemies but no accusations of impropriety specific enough for us to judge them.</p>
        <p>A sweet nostalgic tribute, ''Did You Used to Be R. D. Laing?'' will nevertheless leave many people who are unfamiliar with Laing feeling that they still don't really know him.</p>
        <p>''Did You Used to Be R. D. Laing?'' continues through Saturday at the American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; smarttix.com.</p>

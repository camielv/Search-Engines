        <p>OPENING THIS WEEK</p>
        <p>WILD SALMON -- Jeffrey Chodorow's new place, which opens Friday, will specialize in the food of the Pacific Northwest. Charles Ramseyer, below, who was the chef at Ray's Boathouse in Seattle, will cook with raw materials from that area, including wild Alaskan salmon, black cod, spot prawns, mushrooms, fruits, berries and cheeses, along with wines from Oregon and Washington. Some 250 stylized copper fish hang from the ceiling: 622 Third Avenue (40th Street), (212) 404-1700.</p>
        <p>MANDLER'S THE ORIGINAL SAUSAGE CO. -- This Union Square spot, with its international array of sausages and mustards, opened a branch with seats for 42 near the Port Authority bus terminal yesterday: 601 Eighth Avenue (40th Street), (212) 244-4777.</p>
        <p>OPEN NOW</p>
        <p>STELLA MARIS -- Irish dishes like Dublin-style cockles and mussels, plus bistro dishes and a raw bar, are featured in this new South Street Seaport spot: 213 Front Street (Peck Slip), (212) 233-2417.</p>
        <p>PERI ELA -- A little Turkish restaurant, specializing in flatbreads with fillings, just got its liquor license, and sells three Turkish wines. It is cash only: 1361 Lexington Avenue (90th Street), (212) 410-4300.</p>
        <p>ALATURKA -- Another Turkish place, which has taken over part of Chip Shop next door, features grilled meats and seafood and lots of appetizers: 381 Fifth Avenue (Sixth Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 499-2660.</p>
        <p>MARKT -- The Belgian-style brasserie has moved from the meatpacking district to a smaller space in Chelsea: 676 Avenue of the Americas (20th Street), (212) 727-3314.</p>
        <p>ALICE'S TEA CUP -- This kid-friendly tea room has opened its third location: 220 East 81st Street, (212) 734-4832.</p>
        <p>TRANSFORMATION</p>
        <p>VARIETAL -- Having turned March into the less formal Nish, Wayne Nish has a similar agenda here, where he is devising a less avant-garde menu. To ease the transition, the dining room is closed until Friday, when it will reopen with a limited menu; the bar remains open: 138 West 25th Street: (212) 633-1800. Varietal's former chef, Ed Witt, will soon open Taste in Garden City, N.Y. Jordan Kahn, the pastry chef, is moving to San Francisco.</p>

        <p>The beaten body of a man was found on Monday night in a house in Putnam County, the New York State Police said last night. Although the police had not positively confirmed the victim's identity, investigators believed it was Richard McKeon, 86, of 22 Fordal Place in Lake Peekskill. Neighbors became concerned when they had not seen Mr. McKeon for several days, the police said. They notified the police after entering the house and found him dead in the kitchen with bruises on his body. The police said they were on the lookout for someone Mr. McKeon knew. Lt. James H. Murphy, a state police spokesman, said last night that investigators did not have a motive for the killing, though he added that it did not appear to be a robbery.</p>

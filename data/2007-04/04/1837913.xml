        <p>A man who posed as an investigator to lure two women to Queens motels and forced them to have sex with him was sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court to 15 years in prison, prosecutors said. The man, Eric McCoy, 37, of Beach 26th Street in Far Rockaway, pleaded guilty on Feb. 26 to first-degree rape, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Brown said Mr. McCoy, posing as an investigator on both occasions, told the women that they were under investigation and ordered them to accompany him to a motel for questioning. He said Mr. McCoy beat one of the women and threatened each with arrest if they did not have sex with him.</p>

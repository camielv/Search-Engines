        <p>Two bald eagles hatched in the wild of Santa Catalina Island over the weekend -- the first such births there in half a century -- and several more chicks are expected this week.</p>
        <p>The development adds to hopes of conservationists who are struggling to restore Catalina's once-thriving bald eagle population decades after millions of pounds of DDT and other pollutants devastated it.</p>
        <p>The hatchings arrive at a time when the eagle, rebounding in other spots across the country from its historically low population in the early 1960s, has become a symbol of the success of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. And they are creating quite a buzz on Catalina, a popular tourist destination 26 miles off the coast of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult to describe what it feels like, after 27 years of waiting for something like this,'' said David Garcelon, who as an undergraduate student started Catalina's eagle restoration program in 1980.</p>
        <p>Though the program began introducing adult eagles onto the island long ago, chicks could not hatch there other than in captivity and incubation because DDT ingested by the mother made the eggshells too fragile. But Mr. Garcelon, who has dangled from helicopters toward nests in order to get eggs to incubate, decided to leave some eggs there this year, not only because he could not afford a helicopter but also because the younger female eagles showed signs of greater health.</p>
        <p>In the case of the 8-year-old mother of the two new eaglets, she is healthier largely because of her youth and her preference for eating fish rather than the carcasses of sea lions and gulls, which carry high amounts of DDT, Mr. Garcelon said.</p>
        <p>The eaglets bolster a bald eagle population of about 20 on the 76-square-mile island, including four nesting pairs and an unusual threesome. Some conservationists say the chicks are proof that Catalina deserves a greater share of a settlement between the federal government and the company chiefly responsible for the DDT pollution, the Montrose Chemical Corporation.</p>
        <p>Of the $140 million settlement, reached in 2001, $30 million was allocated to eagle restoration in the eight Channel Islands. In 2005, the portion for Catalina's program was cut to about $30,000 a year from $250,000 because trustees believed that the task there was hopeless and that money would be better spent on those islands less damaged.</p>
        <p>New eaglets or not, it is unlikely that the trustees will quickly reverse themselves. ''The trustees are incredibly excited'' by the births, because their goal is to restore the eagle population on all the islands, said Milena Viljoen of the Montrose Settlements Restoration Program. But, she said, more data will be needed.</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 7, 2007, Saturday  An article on Wednesday about bald eagle hatchings in the wild of Santa Catalina Island misstated the amount of money allocated for eagle restoration in the Channel Islands under a settlement between the federal government and Montrose Chemical Corporation, the company chiefly responsible for DDT pollution in the islands. It is $6.2 million -- not $30 million, which is the amount for restoration of all animals harmed by DDT.</p>

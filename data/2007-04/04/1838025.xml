        <p>WHO will be the next to go private?</p>
        <p>As buyouts have become bigger and bigger, analysts and others have speculated on which public companies may succumb to offers from buyout firms. Here are four companies that have made the rounds as potential targets.</p>
        <p>Home Depot</p>
        <p>The holy grail of buyouts is the $100 billion deal. And the name that has come up most often as the best candidate to be first is Home Depot, the big home-supply retailer.</p>
        <p>Home Depot fits the private equity mold. It has steady revenue and earned $5.76 billion last year. Its 2,163 stores throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and China sit on real estate that buyout firms could sell. Shares trade at 7.6 times operating cash flow, and the company has $614 million in cash.</p>
        <p>Its new management has shown a willingness to sell its wholesale supply business. One of its most outspoken investors, the activist fund Relational Investors, has suggested that the company also consider other strategies, including a buyout.</p>
        <p>But a stock market value of more than $75 billion remains too high for many would-be buyers. Moreover, the new chief executive, Frank S. Blake, said recently, ''We're not thinking about going private.''</p>
        <p>Target price? $100 billion.</p>
        <p>Barnes &amp; Noble</p>
        <p>Pressures from online retailers like Amazon.com have cut into Barnes &amp; Noble's earnings. In a research report, a Credit Suisse analyst, Gary Balter, wrote that the chain was one of the ''best positioned'' buyout candidates among the companies he tracks.</p>
        <p>David Stifel, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, said that the cyclical nature of bookselling works against Barnes &amp; Noble being public, pointing to its reliance on blockbusters, like the ''Harry Potter'' series and memoirs by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama -- books that also receive the biggest discounts. ''Public companies need to show consistency and visibility,'' he said. ''But the book business doesn't work that way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stifel said that a buyout could be made easier because Leonard and Stephen Riggio, the company's chairman and chief executive, respectively, already hold a large portion of its stock -- about 20 percent as of last year. He also praised their management skills.</p>
        <p>Target price? $2.8 billion.</p>
        <p>Motorola</p>
        <p>As its three-year-old Razr cellphone has lost its freshness, Motorola has been scrambling to recover. While some analysts speculated that Motorola would bid for Palm, Inder M. Singh of Prudential Equity Group raised another possibility: a leveraged buyout.</p>
        <p>Private equity has traditionally shunned technology, with its cyclical profits and intensive capital requirements. But Mr. Singh pointed to Motorola's market position as the No. 2 maker of cellphone handsets.</p>
        <p>Its balance sheet is attractive, with $11 billion in cash and $4 billion in debt. Its shares trade at 6.3 times operating cash flow.</p>
        <p>But without an overhaul, the company will probably not deliver for at least five years the double-digit returns that private equity seeks.</p>
        <p>Target price? $53 billion.</p>
        <p>Kimberly-Clark</p>
        <p>In December, shares of Kimberly-Clark, the producer of Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissues, rose, and B. Craig Hutson, an analyst with Gimme Credit, wrote on the company's prospects as a buyout candidate.</p>
        <p>His thoughts haven't changed: Kimberly-Clark bears several hallmarks of an attractive target.</p>
        <p>Compared with Colgate-Palmolive and Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly-Clark's trading multiple is fairly low, at 9.7 times operating cash flow. The company has about $631 million in cash on hand and reported about $483 million in net income last year.</p>
        <p>''The company has a good historical track record for operational growth,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Moreover, unlike rivals such as Clorox, Kimberly-Clark has several fairly distinct segments that could be sold by a private equity buyer.</p>
        <p>Target price? $37.5 billion.</p>

        <p>Editorial urges Congress to eliminate restrictions that are hampering Bush administration's ambitious program to combat AIDS abroad; cites report by panel of experts assembled by Institute of Medicine; notes that restrictions--imposed by Congress or administration and often ideological in nature--limit amount of spending on prevention, require that one-third of prevention budget be used to promote abstinence until marriage, bar use of funds to give clean needles to addicts and require that all antiretroviral medications be approved by FDA, even those already approved by World Health Organization</p>

        <p>An expert committee has found that the Bush administration's ambitious program to combat AIDS abroad is off to a good start but warns that restrictions imposed by Congress or by the administration are hampering efforts to slow the spread of the epidemic. These inflexible barriers are often imposed for ideological, not health reasons.</p>
        <p>The midcourse evaluation of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, was delivered to Congress last week by a panel of experts assembled by the Institute of Medicine, a unit of the National Academy of Sciences. The program assists more than 120 countries in all, but concentrates its resources in 15 countries, mostly in Africa.</p>
        <p>Over all, the panel said Pepfar has demonstrated that AIDS services can be rapidly scaled up (something many skeptics doubted) and now needs to shift its emphasis from emergency relief to building the capacity of affected nations to sustain the effort against AIDS for decades.</p>
        <p>Programs to prevent the spread of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, are perhaps the most important tool in that long-term fight. Yet Congress specified that only 20 percent of the money could be spent on prevention, and one-third of that had to be used to promote abstinence until marriage. More money has been spent in that area than on other prevention activities, including distribution of condoms and blocking mother-to-child transmission.</p>
        <p>Another restriction that existed even before the creation of Pepfar forbids the use of taxpayer money to give clean needles to injecting addicts, while a third requires that all antiretroviral medications be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, even those already approved by the World Health Organization.</p>
        <p>These restrictions needlessly hamper a program with great potential. Congress should eliminate them and let health professionals devise the most effective strategies.</p>

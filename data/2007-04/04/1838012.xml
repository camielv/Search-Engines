        <p>Eight months after he went to jail for refusing to turn over a videotape of a violent protest to federal authorities, a freelance videographer and blogger was released on Tuesday, ending what has been called the longest incarceration ever of an American journalist.</p>
        <p>The videographer, Josh Wolf, was released after appearing before a federal judge here on Monday and turning over a copy of the video he had shot of a July 2005 anticapitalist protest in which a police officer was injured and someone tried to set a police car on fire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolf answered two questions about the protest here, which coincided with a meeting of the Group of Eight economic leaders in Scotland, said his lawyer, Martin Garbus. Mr. Wolf denied seeing anything regarding the attack on the officer or the police car, Mr. Garbus said, and also posted all the video on his Web site, www.joshwolf.net.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolf, 24, was jailed in August for refusing to hand over the video or testify despite a grand jury subpoena. While Mr. Wolf never testified in front of a grand jury, the judge, William Alsup of Federal District Court, said in the release order on Tuesday that the United States attorney now had ''all the materials sought in the subpoena.''</p>
        <p>While some critics, including Judge Alsup, had questioned whether Mr. Wolf, who was unaffiliated with any news organization, actually qualified as a journalist, advocates for press freedom hailed his release.</p>
        <p>''Josh gave up his freedom for 224 days because he believes that a free and independent press cannot exist without a trusting relationship between a journalist and his information sources,'' said Lucie Morillon of Reporters Without Borders, an international freedom-of-the-press group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garbus also characterized Mr. Wolf's release as a victory because he did not testify or identify people on the video, sentiments echoed in a brief statement released by Mr. Wolf.</p>
        <p>''The government met Mr. Wolf's demands: release him without appearing before the grand jury and without having to testify,'' the statement read.</p>

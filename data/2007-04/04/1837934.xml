        <p>8 P.M. (13) IN PERFORMANCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE -- Starting in 1978 with a recital by the pianist Vladimir Horowitz, and continuing with performers ranging from the United States Marine Band to the singer Natalie Cole, this series has celebrated the breadth of American music. Tonight it honors the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, a nonprofit education organization founded in 1986 by the Monk family and Maria Fisher, an opera singer, to offer young musicians college-level training from jazz masters and to bring jazz into public schools. Musicians including Clark Terry, above, perform for President and Mrs. Bush; Barbara Walters is host.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CW) AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL -- Exactly how skinny was she? Twiggy regales the contestants with the story behind her nickname before instructing each woman to come up with a moniker for herself and then use it at a celebrity-heavy party. But when one model gets a little too comfy with the rapper 50 Cent, the festivities turn all wet.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13), 10 P.M. (49) NOVEL REFLECTIONS ON THE AMERICAN DREAM -- There was a time when the country's collective ambitions -- and subsequent despairs -- were fodder for great literature. Take John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath,'' which confronted an inconvenient truth: it sometimes takes more than hard work and clean living to get ahead. When it was published in 1939, the novel was criticized as being full of lies, corruption and Communistic themes. It sold out in a flash. This special looks at seven stories that dared to challenge the fiction of the American dream: works from Theodore Dreiser's ''Sister Carrie'' and Edith Wharton's ''House of Mirth'' to F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby'' (above, a scene from a re-enactment) and Saul Bellow's ''Seize the Day.'' Passages from each book are dramatized through still photography, animation and archival film; Patricia Clarkson narrates.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- Sanjaya Malakar may need more than Howard Stern's help to survive this round. But then, he may just have the vote of every hairstylist in the country. Tonight, one more contestant goes home, leaving eight. A performance by Tony Bennett softens the blow.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (ABC) LOST -- Kate must fend for herself after a betrayal. Meanwhile, Sawyer faces disciplinary action for bad behavior.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Sundance) EMIR KUSTURICA, A TENDER BARBARIAN -- For a quarter of a century, the lovably gruff, Sarajevo-born Mr. Kusturica has been a mainstay of world cinema with films like ''When Father Was Away on Business,'' ''Time of the Gypsies,'' ''Underground'' and ''Black Cat, White Cat,'' which won kudos for their melding of unrestrained desire, rambunctious ethnic music and magical realism. In this documentary, Marie-Christine Malbert creates a profile of her sometime collaborator as he directs his romantic comedy ''Life Is a Miracle,'' presides over the jury at the Cannes Film Festival and performs with No Smoking, his Gypsy rock band.</p>

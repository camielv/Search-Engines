        <p>Those looking for understated baubles will do better passing on the jewelry company Lia Sophia's latest collection, Rue Royale. With its giant dome rings, cabochon necklaces and cuff bracelets adorned with colored crystals, the line was designed with one purpose in mind: to make a statement. ''The goal is to be noticed, to have people come up to you and talk about the jewelry,'' said the line's designer, Dani Stahl, who is also the accessories director at Nylon magazine. ''It's not for the shy.'' Extroverts like Sienna Miller, Teri Hatcher and Kate Hudson have been seen in the Art Deco-inspired pieces in the line, which range in price from $150 cocktail rings to $1,200 medallion necklaces, and can be purchased at liasophia.com.</p>

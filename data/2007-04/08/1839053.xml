        <p>The creationism-versus-evolution debate is a quintessential hot-button issue that continues to pop up in the news, and in American courtrooms, with persistent regularity, so it almost always seems to be the right time for a revival of ''INHERIT THE WIND.'' This 1955 courtroom drama, by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, is based on the Scopes ''monkey trial'' of 1925, in which a Tennessee schoolteacher named John Thomas Scopes was charged with breaking a state law that made it illegal to teach any theory denying the concept of creation as taught in the Bible. Two Tony-winning powerhouses will duke it out in the current revival, directed by Doug Hughes (''Howard Katz''). Brian Dennehy is the prosecutor Matthew Harrison Brady, based on William Jennings Bryan, and Christopher Plummer takes up the defense as Henry Drummond, modeled after Clarence Darrow. In previews; opens on Thursday, Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com; $26.25 to 96.25.</p>
        <p>There's more than one revival with a starry cast opening this week: Kevin Spacey assays another of Eugene O'Neill's alcohol-soaked loners in  ''A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN,'' the third O'Neill play in which Mr. Spacey has appeared on Broadway. This transfer from the Old Vic in London also marks the first collaboration between Mr. Spacey and the director Howard Davies since O'Neill's ''Iceman Cometh,'' which grabbed five Tony nominations in 1999. Mr. Spacey is James Tyrone Jr., and Eve Best plays Josie Hogan in this 1943 heartbreaker about longing, loneliness and love (the unrequited kind). Opens Sunday at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com; $26.50 to $102.50.</p>
        <p>No need to stick to Broadway: The big names in theater don't, and plenty of them are taking part in the Naked Angels Theater Company's  ''ARMED AND NAKED IN AMERICA: A NAKED ANGELS ISSUES PROJECT.'' A two-week series of one-acts about life during wartime, it includes new plays by the Academy Award nominee José Rivera (''The Motorcycle Diaries''), Itamar Moses (''Bach at Leipzig''), Theresa Rebeck (''The Scene'') and the Tony winner Warren Leight (''Side Man''). Wednesday through April 22, the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan,(212) 239-6200, telecharge .com; $40.</p>

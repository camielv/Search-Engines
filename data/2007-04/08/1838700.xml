        <p>FOR school districts in the suburbs of New York City, there was much to celebrate in the new state budget: lots of new money, for rich districts and poor alike, much more than Gov. Eliot Spitzer had originally proposed.</p>
        <p>But the deal that legislative leaders struck with Mr. Spitzer, allowing the budget to be pushed through at the last minute, contained a new formula for what is called high-tax aid.</p>
        <p>And this new formula sends shovels full of dollars to Long Island but only spoonfuls to Westchester. It was so carefully worded, and its impact so lopsided, that Democrats were calling it retribution for the defeat last year of a Republican state senator from Westchester, Nicholas A. Spano.</p>
        <p>Republicans, who control the Senate, did not work very hard to dispel that idea last week.</p>
        <p>''This would never have happened if Senator Nick Spano was still there,'' said Senator Dean G. Skelos, the deputy majority leader from Long Island, during a radio interview in New York City last week.</p>
        <p>In a later interview, he insisted that Republicans had not sought retribution but that Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who ousted Mr. Spano in November, and her Democratic colleagues ''fell asleep at the switch.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart-Cousins replied that the deal was made behind closed doors. ''When you have Dean Skelos even pretending that somehow I sat in the chamber and said nothing -- as if this were some discussion that was open and aboveboard -- it is absolutely ridiculous,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Westchester schools still got lots of money, but in the sibling psychology that prevails in debates over education aid in Albany, there was an outcry over why the county did not get what Nassau and Suffolk got. Westchester County's Assembly delegation voted against the budget package and last week vowed to undo the new formula (the county's senators voted for it).</p>
        <p>''This is a gun that's being pointed at Westchester today,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat. ''If you legitimize this, it could be pointed at New York City or Nassau or Syracuse tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Things became more heated when the governor's office stepped in to defend Senator Stewart-Cousins from the Republicans, and aimed some pointed criticism at the Assembly Democrats who voted against the budget. Mr. Spitzer's budget director, Paul E. Francis, scolded Mr. Brodsky in a letter last week, saying that Westchester made out very well in the new budget. Not only will state aid increase, but the county will also benefit from School Tax Relief, or STAR, rebate increases, he said.</p>
        <p>The governor's communications director, Darren Dopp, said Mr. Brodsky ''simply was nowhere during budget negotiations.''</p>
        <p>''He was more interested in a pay increase for the Legislature and was advancing that,'' Mr. Dopp said. ''He was not talking about Westchester community issues.''</p>
        <p>The State Legislature, particularly the Assembly, has been pushing for a pay raise for several years, but Mr. Brodsky said Mr. Dopp's accusation was untrue. ''I never discussed it with anybody in the course of this budget,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''Mr. Dopp is turning into the governor's hit man. I'm much more interested in dealing with the merits of this issue than in responding, except when it's untrue. What he said is a lie.''</p>
        <p>Overall state aid to Westchester schools will increase 9.4 percent next year, slightly less than the 10.1 percent overall increase that Long Island will get. Many districts that would have received a little new money under Governor Spitzer's original proposal, which would have increased school aid 5 percent on Long Island and 6 percent in Westchester, will get substantially more.</p>
        <p>''What we did, what the Republican senators did, was to drive aid to suburban school districts throughout the state,'' Mr. Skelos said.</p>
        <p>Casual readers of the budget bill could be forgiven for missing its implications for Westchester. The piece of the aid formula that drove more money to Long Island was based on a ratio of the total property tax revenue generated from a county's residents. This was then divided by the total amount of income all residents reported on tax returns.</p>
        <p>Here is how the formula was written: All school districts in counties in which tax levies were more than 4.2 percent of income would get $147.29 in high-tax aid for every student enrolled. In counties that fell below the cutoff, only certain school districts would get aid, $30 per student.</p>
        <p>Westchester has high taxes, but it also has the highest incomes in the state by far -- about $300,000 per student, compared with about $160,000 on Long Island -- and it fell below the cutoff because of its high average income.</p>
        <p>In spite of their many affluent enclaves, Nassau and Suffolk Counties are more diverse than Westchester, and their ratios are above the cutoff. The result is that all Long Island districts will get the higher aid amount, a total of more than $70 million of the $100 million in high-tax aid. Only some Westchester districts get aid, and it amounts to a total of $1.2 million.</p>
        <p>''The goal was giving money to Long Island,'' said Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, a Democrat from Scarsdale. ''What they did was figure out a way to manipulate the numbers to make a formula to do that.''</p>
        <p>Under the budget agreement, the neighboring counties of Orange, Ulster and Putnam will all get more than Westchester will.</p>
        <p>Westchester school officials joined in the outrage. ''It certainly does seem like there were some last-minute political deals, which is unfortunate because there was talk about having a formula and sticking to it,'' said Lisa P. Davis, the president of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association.</p>
        <p>School officials and Westchester Democrats said they would try to undo the high-tax-aid formula. ''The door did not close on this,'' Mr. Brodsky said.</p>

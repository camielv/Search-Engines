      <abstract>
        <p>March 25 article on new approach to helping people who hear voices elicits letter from someone--name withheld--who has found her own way of dealing with voices</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I first heard voices in my head in the 1980's while attending an Ivy League university (Daniel B. Smith, March 25). Since graduation, I've become a lawyer, a spouse, a mother and an active volunteer in my community. Throughout, I've searched for someone to assure me that I'm ''normal'' -- as the voices periodically return. Everyone in the mental-health field has recommended medicating them away. Contrary to their advice, I minimize the voices through exercise, vitamins, hobbies, work and a regular sleep schedule. Thank you for helping me feel normal.</p>

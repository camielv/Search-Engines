      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>THE BASICS  Among the recent entrants in Barcelona's never-ending urban face-lift is the new five-star Hesperia Tower by the British architect Richard Rogers, who was awarded the Pritzker Prize, architecture's highest honor, last month. The 280-room hotel -- including more than 43 suites -- has its own 54,000-square-foot convention center that is somehow discreetly placed off the expansive black-granite lobby/lounge. The interior design is all about modernist furniture and high-tech fabrics; everything seems to have a pewter-lamé thread running through it or a scrunched-up gauzy perma-wrinkle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers's trademark exo-skeletal design -- structural beams painted bright red and blue -- is an eye-catcher. And what looks like a spaceship that has landed atop the hotel is Evo, a 55-seat restaurant by the chef Santi Santamaria, who has won Michelin Stars.</p>
        <p>LOCATION  In the otherwise low-slung L'Hospitalet area and closer to the airport than the city center, the 350-foot high building -- one of the tallest buildings in Catalonia -- is steps away from the Fira de Barcelona, a major convention center.</p>
        <p>THE ROOMS  There is a distinctly upscale ocean-liner feel to the rooms, which are tautly designed and outfitted with luxurious materials: varnished mahogany panels with stainless-steel insets and buttery velour upholstery in shades of wheat and burgundy. The desktop flips up to reveal a mirrored vanity, and one has the sense that the bed could also flip up into the crisply framed headboard.</p>
        <p>There are two kinds of suites, one with a separate sitting room suitable for small business meetings. The duplex suites on the 25th floor have Jacuzzis in the bedrooms and sweeping starlight vistas.</p>
        <p>THE BATHROOMS  A spacious black ''lobby'' with double sinks and infinite mirrors has doors leading to the closet, the shower and the toilet. The hydromassage shower is pure heaven, as is the ample supply of both house valet products (toothbrushes, combs, etc.) and Bulgari bath gels and shampoos.</p>
        <p>AMENITIES  Given its first-kid-on-the-block status in reviving the area, the hotel is wisely self-contained and can arrange many an in-house service, like simultaneous translation in the auditorium. Guests can tone up at the sprawling new Metropolitan Health Club and Spa next door.</p>
        <p>There is also the Tower Club, a five-floor hotel-within-the-hotel with a private lobby (for check-in and concierge services) and a swank floor-through lounge where breakfast, tea, tapas and cocktails are offered to guests at no extra charge.</p>
        <p>ROOM SERVICE  In-room dining is a real option, though the hotel has several distinct and stylish restaurants and bars. A room-service meal of miniburgers with crispy fries and linguini al pesto and a bottle of rosé arrived in about 25 minutes.</p>
        <p>THE CROWD  The lively bar scene in the lobby and the draw of Evo upstairs ensure that there is no shortage of fashionable folk who come to hobnob with business travelers and check out this somewhat surprising corner of the city's ever-growing nexus of architecture and gastronomy.</p>
        <p>THE BOTTOM LINE  With standard rates that start at 390 euros, about $520, at $1.36 to the euro, for a standard double, the hotel is officially in expense account territory. But frequent -- and steep -- discounts can often be found on even the upper-category rooms. Add in the gorgeous design, impeccable five-star service, culinary pedigree and the full-scale spa, and the style-minded leisure traveler might not mind the cab or metro ride to the city center.</p>

        <p>THE Internet makes it possible to do a lot of things at 3 o'clock on a Sunday morning, including sauntering through an auto showroom -- a virtual one, that is. But one thing has been missing: a sales pitch.</p>
        <p>That is about to change.</p>
        <p>A year after introducing Motormouth, a series of CDs for car salespeople to play during test drives, Steve Levin is introducing a line of nerve-soothing studio-produced pitches to accompany photos on the Web sites of automakers and dealers. A sample of the online product can be heard by clicking on the dealer sample page at motormouthaudio.com.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin and his staff plan to produce 4,500 four-to-six-minute tracks -- one for almost every car made by major manufacturers. The pitches should appear online in May.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin, a former car dealer who lives in Eatontown, N.J., will be distributing the audio files through Autodata, a provider of research.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Levin, 70 to 80 percent of customers research automobiles on the Internet before buying. Most times, people make their choice based on price, not because they fill a particular need. ''In my 32 years in this business, I've found a lot of times people spend a lot of money to buy a new car, and when they go home it doesn't measure up to what they thought,'' Mr. Levin said.</p>
        <p>While developing the Motormouth CDs, Mr. Levin's wife, Carol, suggested that the studio-produced pitches could be put on dealers' and manufacturers' sites, enhancing their appeal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin knows buying a car can be stressful. A dealer might forget something during a pitch, and a buyer might forget to ask a question.</p>
        <p>There are no audio files for online haggling with a virtual sales clerk -- yet. But he believes the product will help dealers make buyers more aware of a vehicle's features, and it will help buyers feel they have made a better decision before a big purchase.</p>
        <p>''This is a win-win for everybody,'' Mr. Levin said.</p>

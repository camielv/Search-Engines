        <p>''We're fantasy players ourselves, and we recognize that it is not acceptable for our players to have anything short of a great experience,'' an ESPN.com spokesman, Paul Melvin, said in a written statement. ''We also recognize that getting every problem resolved is what will ultimately satisfy our players.''</p>
        <p>In 2005, ESPN.com was forced to apologize to fans for traffic problems with its Fantasy Football League. ESPN.com would not disclose how many users play fantasy games through its Web site, and would not say how many users have been affected by the most recent problem.</p>

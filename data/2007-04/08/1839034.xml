        <p>Valencia, of course, is the home of paella (and, this year, of the America's Cup), but the best paella I could find in the area was outside the city, in a town called Picassent. To get there, I drove though the Albufera, the rice-growing region around a vast lake where -- arguably, at least -- Europe's best and first rice is grown.</p>
        <p>The Valencians, sensibly but without firm proof, claim that Arabs brought rice to Spain before it appeared elsewhere in Europe. They also maintain that paella is the only ''real'' rice dish in Europe, that everything else, including risotto, is ''arroz con cosas'' (''rice with things'').</p>

        <p>Valencia, of course, is the home of paella (and, this year, of the America's Cup), but the best paella I could find in the area was outside the city, in a town called Picassent. To get there, I drove though the Albufera, the rice-growing region around a vast lake where -- arguably, at least -- Europe's best and first rice is grown.</p>
        <p>The Valencians, sensibly but without firm proof, claim that Arabs brought rice to Spain before it appeared elsewhere in Europe. They also maintain that paella is the only ''real'' rice dish in Europe, that everything else, including risotto, is ''arroz con cosas'' (''rice with things'').</p>
        <p>Anyway. In Valencia you find the showy paella places, the ones visited by Hemingway and most tourists. In Picassent you find a restaurant called L'Alter, where Pep Crespo (below), the 28-year-old grandson of the founder, presides over the kitchen. His method of paella making is traditional, precise, special: he cooks it over orangewood, as it has been cooked for centuries.</p>
        <p>I'm not a big fan of running into restaurant kitchens -- most look pretty much the same -- but this one is stunning: it's dark, spartan, and it has an entire wall lined with small grills. On a busy day, each grill has a wood fire underneath, a paella pan on top, and Pep is running around like a madman.</p>
        <p>At L'Alter, as in any paella place worth the name, the paella is set in the middle of the table, then attacked by all diners simultaneously. The dish contains chicken, rabbit, snails, Romano beans, white beans, tomatoes, sweet pimento and rosemary all mixed in with the rice -- but Mr. Crespo's secret ''ingredient'' is the smoke from the orangewood. It scents the paella with an unimaginably wonderful perfume. The process isn't easy; Mr. Crespo has to adjust the heat as he's cooking by moving the small logs around under the pan. And he cooks each paella so carefully that they develop the perfect socarrat, the classic slightly burnt, crisp bottom that you scrape up with a wooden spoon.</p>
        <p>The combination of ingredients, he insists (he's joined by others), is the correct one, and I'm sure that's true for Picassent. But in those parts of the Valencia region closer to the Mediterranean, seafood is obviously a more sensible addition than rabbit. Despite Valencian pride, this is, after all, yet another version of arroz con cosas. It's just one of the best ones.</p>
        <p>Lunch only; open daily. A meal for two with wine is about 50 euros, or $67 at $1.36 to the euro. L'Alter, Ca Juliet 3, Picassent, Spain; (34-961) 230-537.</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 22, 2007, Sunday  The Bites column on April 8 about paella at L'Alter in Picassent, Spain, misstated an ingredient in the paella. It is sweet pimentón (paprika), not pimento.</p>

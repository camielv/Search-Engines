        <p>The body of a woman was found yesterday inside a black bag underneath a bridge in the Bronx, not far from Van Cortlandt Park, the police said.</p>
        <p>A police statement described the body, which was ''fully clothed and intact,'' as that of a black woman between the ages of 30 and 40.</p>
        <p>A caller reported the body to 911 about 9:25 a.m.</p>
        <p>The bag was under the Fieldston Road entrance to the Henry Hudson Parkway in Frank Shackett Park. The police said they were in the early stages of their investigation.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office said an autopsy to determine the cause of death was scheduled for today.</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 13, 2007, Friday  An article in some copies on Sunday about the discovery of a woman's body under a bridge in a Bronx park misstated the name of the park. It is Frank S. Hackett Park, not Frank Shackett.</p>

        <p>Responding to complaints from business owners and residents, the police in Mount Vernon arrested 31 men last weekend on charges of patronizing prostitutes. Twenty-eight vehicles were seized.</p>
        <p>The men were arrested on March 30 and 31 near the corner of West First Street and Vista Place on the Bronx border, a well-known meeting place for prostitutes and their customers.</p>

        <p>The Indian Point 3 nuclear reactor was shut down for nearly a day last week after a water-pump control device malfunctioned. The plant was also forced to retest its new emergency system after problems arose with 123 of 150 new sirens.</p>

        <p>Responding to complaints from business owners and residents, the police in Mount Vernon arrested 31 men last weekend on charges of patronizing prostitutes. Twenty-eight vehicles were seized.</p>
        <p>The men were arrested on March 30 and 31 near the corner of West First Street and Vista Place on the Bronx border, a well-known meeting place for prostitutes and their customers.</p>
        <p>On March 30, New York City police officers arrested five men on similar charges just over the county line in the Bronx. The stings were part of Operation Impact, a statewide program encouraging collaboration among police departments from different communities, said David E. Chong, the police commissioner in Mount Vernon.</p>
        <p>''We want to send a message to criminals that there are no borders in law enforcement,'' he said. Commissioner Chong said the arrests were prompted by recurring complaints from merchants and residents in the area. ''It's not just prostitution itself,'' he said, ''but what it brings to the community -- noise, traffic, unsanitary conditions and a general sense of disorder.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Ernest D. Davis applauded the arrests, saying in a statement, ''This type of conduct has no place in our city.''</p>
        <p>Commissioner Chong said that a smaller sweep in the area late last year aimed at the same crimes resulted in more than a half-dozen arrests. He said that his department intended to keep doing such sweeps in the vicinity if reports of prostitution continued.</p>
        <p>Business owners commended the sting. Jose Perdomo, the owner of La Plaza Food Market on White Plains Road, on the Bronx side of the border, said that even though the prostitutes bought coffee and snacks from him, he would rather not have their business. ''It's not good for the area,'' he said. ''They leave a lot of garbage outside on the street.''</p>
        <p>He was echoed by a manager, who declined to give his name, at the First Street Carwash and Lube, on the corner where the arrests took place. ''It's not good for the kids around the area,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The men arrested were 18 to 46 years old and hailed mostly from Mount Vernon, the Bronx and Yonkers, according to the Mount Vernon police. None of the men could be reached for comment.</p>

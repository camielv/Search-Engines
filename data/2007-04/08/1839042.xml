        <p>Gordon Ramsay, the celebrity chef known for such food programs as ''Hell's Kitchen'' in the United States and ''The F-Word'' in Britain, has opened yet another eating establishment in a city already overpopulated with dining rooms bearing his brand. Adding to his roster of nine other London restaurants -- including one at Claridge's and another in the Savoy -- not to mention his outposts in New York, Dubai and Tokyo, Mr. Ramsay last month opened an upscale pub (above) on the banks of the Thames in the East End.</p>
        <p>It is called the Narrow, and the menu features such dishes as potted Cromer crab and Gloucester pig cheeks with bashed neeps. Guests who don't fancy a pint of beer can always try the pub's original cocktails--though the Wallpaper (Cachaça, passion fruit, vanilla gomme and a touch of chili) sounds more like what the river just washed up than a tasty cocktail. What's next for Mr. Ramsay? Later this year he plans to open yet another ''gastropub,'' the Warrington, in the Maida Vale section of London.</p>

        <p>With the New York City Opera's ''FLAVIO'' safely under way, more Handel opera arrives this week at the Metropolitan Opera in the form of ''GIULIO CESARE.'' The two Handels battle it out on Tuesday night at Lincoln Center, separated by only a few hundred feet. There will be more breathing room between the two later in the week. ''Flavio'' repeats Thursday and Saturday, ''Cesare'' on Friday. Handel operas have become a major new archaeological dig for opera companies and an increasing audience favorite; ''Cesare'' has helped lead the restoration. The Met offers a splendid pair of principals: the countertenor David Daniels and the soprano Ruth Ann Swenson, along with Patricia Bardon and Alice Coote. Harry Bicket conducts. Tuesday and Friday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375.</p>
        <p>Two other interesting opera productions visit from across the Atlantic this week. Benjamin Britten's ''CURLEW RIVER'' comes to the Japan Society by way of the Rouen/Haute-Normandie Opera. Yoshi Oida, based in Paris, directs. Thursday through Saturday at 7:30 p.m., 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $52.</p>
        <p>Mozart's familiar ''ZAUBERFLÖTE'' gets a spiffy update from the South African director William Kentridge. Expect high-tech fantasy and undertones of apartheid in this production from La Monnaie in Brussels, at the Brooklyn Academy Of Music. Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m., 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $30 to $125.</p>

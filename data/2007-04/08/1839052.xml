        <p>''Rare'' concert appearances are usually not so rare; touring pays, so if they can get a gig, most musicians will sooner or later find their way back to New York. But this week is a true rarity: JANDEK, a Texas singer, guitarist, occasional keyboardist and all-around musical sphinx who since the late 1970s has released dozens of strange and challenging albums while having virtually no public persona. Creaky and dissonant, with vocals that go from wounded groans to screams, his music is a nightmarish variation of folk-rock, and over the years he has become a kind of Thomas Pynchon of music. For years no one was sure if the gaunt figure pictured on Jandek's album covers was even him.</p>
        <p>But a few years ago Jandek -- whose real name may or may not be Sterling Smith -- started to break out of his shell with a very light touring schedule that included a couple of shows in New York. Onstage he was appropriately enigmatic: Beanpole-thin, with a pale, severe face, he played stark, squally music with a small band, not speaking a word to his audience. But everybody clapped madly nonetheless, and is sure to do again on Saturday when Jandek returns for one show, backed by Tim Foljahn (of Two Dollar Guitar) on bass and the drummer Jim White (of the Dirty Three). To date Jandek is believed to have played fewer than 30 concerts. Who knows when, or if, he will return again? 8 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 598-0400, henrystreet.org; $20.</p>

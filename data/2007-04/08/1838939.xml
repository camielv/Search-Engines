        <p>Richard R. Sarles has been at New Jersey Transit for nearly five years, working on expanding and creating light rail service in South Jersey, Newark and Hudson County. Now he will be running the entire agency.</p>
        <p>After a three-month national search, New Jersey Transit announced that it had tapped Mr. Sarles to serve as its executive director. He succeeds George D. Warrington, who served five years and announced his retirement in January.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarles, 62, has been the agency's assistant executive director for capital programs and planning since 2002. He previously worked for Amtrak and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. While at the Port Authority, he ''led a successful effort to bring a major railcar manufacturer to the region to overhaul and manufacture new PATH cars,'' according to a statement released by New Jersey Transit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarles said in a statement that he was committed ''to focusing intensely on what customers need and want from our service.''</p>
        <p>''Today, transit is a good option,'' he said. ''I will work with the governor, the board and employees to make it the preferred choice for travel in New Jersey.''</p>

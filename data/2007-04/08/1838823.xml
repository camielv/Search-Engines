        <p>The stock market had a short but splendid week, with gains that brought the three major indexes close to the peaks they had reached before the sharp global sell-off that started on Feb. 27.</p>
        <p>The stock market was closed for Good Friday but it climbed on the four days in which it was open, in part because of a wave of mergers and acquisitions -- or attempts at them. For example, Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor, made a $4.5 billion bid for Chrysler. And First Data, the credit card processor, agreed to a takeover offer from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for about $29 billion. First Data shares rose 20 percent for the week, the best weekly performance in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.</p>

        <p>For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 205.85 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 12,560.20. The S.&amp; P. 500 climbed 22.90 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 1,443.76. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 49.70 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 2,471.34.</p>
        <p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.75 percent from 4.65 percent the previous week. The yield jumped during abbreviated bond market trading on Friday, in response to a strong Labor Department report on employment in March.</p>

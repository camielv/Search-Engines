        <p>In a move that government officials call economical, logical and mutually beneficial, the Town of North Hempstead will acquire 9 parks and 12 roads from Nassau County.</p>
        <p>County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi and Town Supervisor Jon Kaiman announced a plan on March 29 to transfer 230 acres and 26 miles of roads from the county to the town.</p>
        <p>If it is approved by the County and State Legislatures, the county will pay the town $3 million to take over the properties and to assume all repairs and maintenance, effective in September. The money is expected to cover the costs of equipment and extra crews needed by the town.</p>
        <p>The action will save county taxpayers millions of dollars in road and park maintenance expenses, Mr. Suozzi said. Although he said he could not predict the annual savings, he said that by no longer resurfacing the 12 roads, the county would save $1.7 million in capital funds.</p>
        <p>The transfer will give the town more control of local parks and roads.</p>
        <p>''We are in need of additional recreational space for ball fields and other uses, and to acquire more land would be very expensive,'' Mr. Kaiman said. ''Taking over county land that is now underutilized makes perfect sense.''</p>
        <p>He cited Bar Beach, a town beach that is separated from Hempstead Harbor, a county property, by only a fence. ''Since the beaches are used mostly by residents of the Town of North Hempstead, we will be able to take down the fence and use the entire area more effectively,'' Mr. Kaiman said.</p>
        <p>The other largest parks planned for transfer are Manhasset Valley and Whitney Pond, both in Manhasset.</p>
        <p>Among the roads to be transferred are Plandome Road in Manhasset and Main Street in Port Washington.</p>
        <p>''Since we're responsible for the sidewalks and the curbs, we might as well be responsible for the roads as well,'' Mr. Kaiman said.</p>

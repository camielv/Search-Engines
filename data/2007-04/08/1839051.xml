        <p>''OPERATION HOMECOMING'' is an unusual documentary that explores the experience of living through war, as told by the American soldiers who are fighting in it. Robert Duvall, Aaron Eckhart and Josh Lucas are among the actors doing dramatic readings of various soldiers' writings. These private works, including letters, poems, essays, journals and fiction, open a window into the personal impact of recent conflicts. The film is an initiative created by the National Endowment for the Arts, which worked with the documentary maker Richard E. Robbins. It had its debut in February at Film Forum in New York and opened theatrically on Friday in Los Angeles and Boston but will also be released this week in Seattle, St. Louis and other cities. Those who miss it in theaters can catch it on April 16 on most PBS stations.</p>
        <p>''AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE COLON MOVIE FILM FOR THEATERS'' is a movie better seen late, perhaps in an altered state of some kind. This R-rated, 2-D animated feature is about three crime-fighting fast food items -- Frylock, Master Shake and Meatwad -- seeking truth and justice (not really). It's a feature-length riff on the animated series created by a couple of offbeat slackers, Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis, whose series can be seen be seen on the Cartoon Network's late-night block of programming, Adult Swim. The creators' sense of humor makes ''South Park'' look positively tame. (One of the more printable things they do is set a poodle on fire.) The series has a cult following, natch, so screenings might be raucous affairs. Opens nationwide Friday.</p>

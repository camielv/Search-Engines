      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The highest-ranking American official to set foot in Somalia in more than a decade returned from a trip there on Saturday conceding there were ''significant problems'' but saying ''we have to have faith in the people of Somalia.''</p>
        <p>The official, Jendayi Frazer, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, spent five hours in Baidoa, Somalia, meeting with top officials of the Somali transitional government, which has been struggling to gain control of the country.</p>
        <p>For the past two weeks, government forces have been battling insurgents in intense urban combat that has killed or wounded more than 1,000 civilians and driven more than 100,000 people from their homes. Human rights groups have called it the worst fighting in Somalia in 15 years and accused Ethiopian troops, who are backing the Somali government, of indiscriminately shelling neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Ms. Frazer said, ''Everybody used excessive force.''</p>
        <p>An increasing number of Somalis seem to be violently opposed to the transitional government, saying it is as clan-based and corrupt as the 13 previous transitional governments that have failed.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Frazer remains optimistic.</p>
        <p>''In Africa,'' she said at a news conference in Nairobi after her visit, ''you have to be.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Frazer said that to reverse the deteriorating situation, Somalia's transitional leaders must establish a cease-fire, reconcile with clan elders, plan elections and eventually work themselves out of a job. She pledged $100 million in American aid to help.</p>
        <p>''The Somali people have to realize this is just a transitional government, and it doesn't have to be perfect,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A shaky truce between insurgents and government forces seemed to be holding Saturday, and residents of Mogadishu, Somalia's reliably chaotic capital, said that for once there was no gunfire or artillery shelling.</p>
        <p>Also, pirates released two ships -- including one hired by the United Nations -- that they had recently hijacked off Somalia's long, unpatrolled coastline. The United Nations said all crew members were returning safely to shore, though they were cautious about celebrating too early. ''The threat of piracy,'' said Peter Goossens, an official for the United Nations World Food Program, ''is still very much alive in Somali waters.''</p>
        <p>Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when the central government collapsed and the country exploded into clan-based warfare. The United States tried to help, sending thousands of peacekeepers in 1992 to deliver food. But that mission was cut short after Somali militiamen shot down two American helicopters and killed 18 American soldiers in the infamous Black Hawk Down episode in 1993.</p>
        <p>Ms. Frazer is the highest-ranking American official to venture onto Somalia soil since 1994. She arrived with a contingent of bodyguards and the trip was kept secret until she left.</p>
        <p>She pinned Somalia's continuing violence on ''spoilers'' who she said were led by remnants of the nation's Islamist movement, which held power briefly last year until it was routed by Ethiopian troops, with covert American help.</p>
        <p>Ms. Frazer also accused neighboring countries, especially Eritrea, of trying to destabilize Somalia. Eritrea is a bitter enemy of Ethiopia, and Ms. Frazer said it was widely known that Eritrea will ''do anything to hurt Ethiopia.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Frazer told the transitional Parliament in Baidoa: ''Somalia's people have a historic window of opportunity. I believe firmly that the Somali people are tired of fighting. I believe very firmly that they want peace. And I commit the U.S. government to assist them in achieving those results.''</p>

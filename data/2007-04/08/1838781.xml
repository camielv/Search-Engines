        <p>ON a sunny afternoon last week, Richard Rosen, who has explored the winding roads of Little Neck for virtually all of his 43 years, piloted his navy minivan around the service roads of Lake Success, the Nassau County community just over the city line from his house in Little Neck. His goal was to check out stone barriers along the Long Island Expressway that are designed to keep highway noise from spilling into adjacent residential areas.</p>
        <p>''Look how tall that one is,'' Mr. Rosen exclaimed, pointing to a barrier at least 16 feet tall as he idled at a stoplight. ''Obviously, you can tell it's totally different.''</p>

        <p>ON a sunny afternoon last week, Richard Rosen, who has explored the winding roads of Little Neck for virtually all of his 43 years, piloted his navy minivan around the service roads of Lake Success, the Nassau County community just over the city line from his house in Little Neck. His goal was to check out stone barriers along the Long Island Expressway that are designed to keep highway noise from spilling into adjacent residential areas.</p>
        <p>''Look how tall that one is,'' Mr. Rosen exclaimed, pointing to a barrier at least 16 feet tall as he idled at a stoplight. ''Obviously, you can tell it's totally different.''</p>
        <p>Totally different, he meant, from similar barriers that were recently installed on the Queens side of the expressway. Those barriers are mostly fences made of wood and brick, and are only about 10 feet high in places. And in the opinion of Mr. Rosen and some of his neighbors, they are too short to sufficiently muffle noise from the highway. He also contends that the maroonish hue on the side of the barriers facing the road is not as nice as the lighter red used for the barriers in Nassau County.</p>
        <p>Ed Doster, a member of Community Board 11, agrees. ''Five blocks from where I am, you're in Nassau County and the barriers are higher and more attractive-looking,'' he said. ''We get the short end of everything. If they would come out and look, they would see the barriers are not high enough.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Doster was referring to the state's Department of Transportation. For years, he and other local residents have been dealing with the agency over the specifics of the barriers, most of which were built within the last six months. They are puzzled as to why the barriers on the two sides of the county line are different, given that the same agencies built both.</p>
        <p>The answer, said Adam Levine, an agency spokesman, is that although the city's barriers may be shorter, they were built in proportion to local topography and are high enough to block noise. In a recent test, Mr. Levine said, the Little Neck barriers exceeded expectations, blocking 10 decibels of noise, compared with the expected 5.</p>
        <p>''We've already spoken with the community board, and we'll continue to work with them to see if there's anything we can do to see that things work," Mr. Levine said. "If there are specific complaints where we feel we do need to do some remediation, we'd be open to that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosen, who has three daughters under 15, has another complaint about the barrier behind his house, which is next to the highway. The wall sits behind his backyard fence, with a three-foot-wide bed of gravel separating the barriers, and Mr. Rosen is worried that one of his girls might climb over the fence to chase an errant basketball and be unable to get back.</p>
        <p>''That's the main issue that bothers me, this security issue,'' he said. ''The problem is that if something should go behind the fence, it's now trapped between the fence and the wall and there's no getting it.''</p>

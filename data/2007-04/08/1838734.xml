        <p>NEW JERSEY: 10 Woodstone Road</p>
        <p>A 35-year-old colonial with a two-story addition, four bedrooms, two baths and two half baths, a large studio with cathedral ceiling, a renovated kitchen, a family room and a finished basement. Ruth and Allan Lipnick (owners), (973) 540-9044, (973) 214-3735</p>
        <p>TAXES: $9,373.07 a year</p>
        <p>PROS: The house has loads of living and storage space, and oversized Pella windows throughout the first floor.</p>
        <p>CONS: The backyard is small. The master bathroom could use updating.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: 262 Bond Street (near DeGraw Street)</p>

        <p>COMMON CHARGE: $227 a month; taxes: $221 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: In a fast-developing neighborhood a block from the Gowanus Canal, the building has received an Energy Star rating for its use of efficient mechanicals and sustainable and recycled materials.</p>
        <p>CONS: Another bath and bedrooms could be added on the second floor, but it would be at the buyer's expense.</p>

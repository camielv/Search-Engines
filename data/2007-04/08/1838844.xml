        <p>The sailors were brought to the palace to meet with the Iranian president before being released. The sailors were given suits but no ties, because ties are considered a Western extravagance. You know, as opposed to living in a palace.</p>

        <p>Republican candidates are announcing their first-quarter fundraising totals so far. Mitt Romney announced that he has raised $23 million. Meanwhile, Rudy Giuliani announced he's raised $15 million and Tom Tancredo announced he's raised two children.</p>
        <p>This weekend at the New York Auto Show, the taxicab of the future will be on display. Designers say the cab is so futuristic that the driver will be from a country that doesn't even exist yet.</p>

        <p>When the Papaya King chain was considering towns for its first New Jersey outpost, Clifton was a natural pick.</p>
        <p>It is home to hot-dog-hawking institutions like Rutt's Hut and the Hot Grill and an important stop on the Jersey Hot Dog Tour, an annual outing attended by aficionados who swap impressions of casings and buns on Web sites like roadfood.com.

        <p>When the Papaya King chain was considering towns for its first New Jersey outpost, Clifton was a natural pick.</p>
        <p>It is home to hot-dog-hawking institutions like Rutt's Hut and the Hot Grill and an important stop on the Jersey Hot Dog Tour, an annual outing attended by aficionados who swap impressions of casings and buns on Web sites like roadfood.com. Indeed, Clifton may be the hot dog capital of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Which means formidable competition for Matt Visconti, a Wyckoff resident who fulfilled a decades-long dream of getting into the hot dog business by opening his Papaya King franchise in January, next to the Italian-food wholesaler Corrado's Family Affair. It is one of only two Papaya Kings outside New York City; the other is a hot dog truck in Portland, Me.</p>
        <p>Unlike the product served by the competition, the Clifton Papaya King's all-beef dog is grilled rather than deep fried, Mr. Visconti said.</p>
        <p>Then there are the drinks; the blue papaya is something of a classic, a smoothie made with blueberries, bananas, nonfat frozen yogurt and papaya drink ($4.49 for 21 ounces).</p>
        <p>Papaya King also has a certain pedigree. Zagat calls the chain's wieners ''the crown jewels of hot doggery.'' The chef and food writer Anthony Bourdain served them at his 50th birthday celebration. And a Papaya King was once featured on ''Seinfeld.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Visconti, a lifelong New Jerseyan, would never want to impose Manhattan sensibilities on a town that clearly has its own ideas about hot dogs, though.</p>
        <p>His 11-stool eatery, in the impressively industrial-looking former wine-pressing center at Corrado's, takes New Jersey inclinations into account. The Corrado Dog ($2.29), for example, comes with peppers and onions. (''That's how people like it here,'' Mr. Visconti said.) And sandwiches -- egg salad, tuna salad and chicken salad -- also made it onto the menu ($4.79).</p>
        <p>Noting the presence of ''somewhere between 150 and 200 accountants'' for A&amp;P working in nearby offices, Mr. Visconti explained, ''Sometimes they want something other than a frank and a fruit drink.''</p>
        <p>Papaya King, 600 Getty Avenue, Clifton; (973) 340-1100. Open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily.</p>

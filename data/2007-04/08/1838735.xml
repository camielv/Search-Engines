        <p>IT was a sight that would probably have made Hutchins F. Inge and Walter G. Alexander proud. There was Gov. Jon S. Corzine in his outer office last Wednesday, flanked by some of the Legislature's most prominent African-American lawmakers, signing a bill that would make sure you knew precisely who Dr. Inge and Dr. Alexander were.</p>
        <p>In the words of Mr. Corzine, they were trailblazers -- the first African-Americans to serve in each house of the Legislature. Dr. Inge, a doctor from Newark, was elected to the Senate in 1966; he died in 2002. Dr. Alexander, of Orange, also a doctor, joined the Assembly in 1921; he died in 1953.</p>

        <p>IT was a sight that would probably have made Hutchins F. Inge and Walter G. Alexander proud. There was Gov. Jon S. Corzine in his outer office last Wednesday, flanked by some of the Legislature's most prominent African-American lawmakers, signing a bill that would make sure you knew precisely who Dr. Inge and Dr. Alexander were.</p>
        <p>In the words of Mr. Corzine, they were trailblazers -- the first African-Americans to serve in each house of the Legislature. Dr. Inge, a doctor from Newark, was elected to the Senate in 1966; he died in 2002. Dr. Alexander, of Orange, also a doctor, joined the Assembly in 1921; he died in 1953.</p>
        <p>But the bill signing would most likely have pleased the men less for the celebration of their accomplishments than for the presence of a handful of the state's most influential African-American lawmakers -- Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, the leader of the Democratic majority, and Senator Ronald L. Rice, who just completed his 20th year in the upper house.</p>
        <p>Even in a moment of celebration, however, it was hard not to think of another trailblazer, one who was arguably the Legislature's most influential African-American voice in recent years and who was conspicuous by his absence -- Senator Wayne R. Bryant. Just a day earlier, Mr. Bryant appeared in federal court to answer an indictment on charges of using a handful of no-work jobs to inflate his pension improperly.</p>
        <p>As chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, Mr. Bryant held the kind of sway that is rare for lawmakers of any background. And while the charges against him are certainly no graver than those against any other politician because of his background, his indictment may have a deeper resonance among African-Americans.</p>
        <p>''African-Americans have a history of having very high standards for their elected officials because of the endurance of being powerless over much of the 20th century,'' said Clement A. Price, a history professor at Rutgers University-Newark. ''They have to represent the highest values, the most burnished of ethos out of our community. But politics often does overtake the traditional ethos and standards.''</p>
        <p>While the question of whether that was the case for Mr. Bryant might not be answered until his case is resolved, his political forefathers, Dr. Inge and Dr. Alexander, by all accounts maintained those standards as legislators.</p>
        <p>Peter J. Mazzei, a legislative researcher who studied their careers, noted that they had been strong advocates for health care, civil rights and greater honesty in government. And often while enduring particularly vicious slings and arrows, including racial slurs by other legislators.</p>
        <p>Through it all, the record shows, Dr. Inge and Dr. Alexander maintained grace and dignity. ''They set the standard for all of us,'' Mr. Corzine said.</p>

        <p>Bud Palmer moved from one outstanding career to another. A basketball star at Princeton, he played for the Knicks from 1946 to 1949 and was the team's first captain. After his playing career ended, he was a longtime television sportscaster and New York City's public events commissioner. Now 85, Palmer lives in West Palm Beach, Fla.</p>
        <p>FRANK LITSKY</p>
        <p>HOW IS YOUR HEALTH? I've had prostate cancer for 15 years. I have Guillain-Barré syndrome, which affects my nervous system and my balance, and I can't play golf or tennis or ski anymore. I walk like a drunk. A doctor told me recently that I've had a broken back for 60 years. My left knee bothers me. Except for that, I'm in the greatest shape.</p>
        <p>WERE YOU A GOOD SPORTSCASTER? I thought I was pretty good because I tried not to tell people what they just saw, and I learned when to keep my trap shut. When I did golf, I was criticized for not talking enough, but when you play golf, you don't talk when a guy is trying to hit a shot.</p>
        <p>WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN YOU STARTED WITH THE KNICKS? It was tough because nobody on the outside knew anything about pro basketball. We played every college team in New York, which had the best teams in the country, to convince the public we were good.</p>
        <p>WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE PLAYING TODAY? No. The game has advanced so. I watch it on TV and I don't recognize it. Teamwork has disappeared. Everything is happening above the rim.</p>
        <p>HOW DO YOU WANT TO BE REMEMBERED? I always thought of myself as a strong defensive player. I think I was pretty tough to play against.</p>

        <p>During tough budget times in 1990, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. terminated the state's highway sound barrier program. Since then -- despite a significant increase in congestion -- no barriers have been built along Connecticut's busiest byways, except for a handful in areas that qualified for federal aid by expanding capacity.</p>
        <p>Some residents, particularly those living near Interstate 95, have long clamored for new sound barriers. Several years ago, Debra Kandrak, a Westport real estate agent whose home is 200 yards from the turnpike, founded an ad hoc committee called Got Noise? The group hired a firm to conduct a professional sound test and gathered more than 1,000 signatures on a petition sent to state and local officials.</p>
        <p>''As homeowners, we needed relief from the constant roar of traffic,'' Ms. Kandrak said. ''Over the years, we wrote letters and sent faxes and made calls, but we were always told the same thing: There's no funding, and it's not a priority.''</p>
        <p>This spring, Ms. Kandrak may get her wish. In March, the State Senate's Transportation Committee approved a bill requiring the State Department of Transportation to rank sound barrier needs, based on proximity to residential areas and the results of scientific decibel tests. The bill authorizes $10 million in bonding to study where sound barriers are needed most.</p>
        <p>''For the first time in more than 15 years, we will have new sound barriers built on I-95 to protect residents from the surge in noise that has occurred since the program was suspended,'' said State Senator William H. Nickerson, a Republican who represents Fairfield County and is one of the bill's sponsors. ''I am cautiously optimistic that this bill will be adopted by the House and Senate later this spring and signed into law.''</p>
        <p>But releasing the money for the study is only one small step; securing the appropriations to actually build sound barriers may prove difficult. Standard wooden barriers cost $1.3 million per mile, not including site preparation or landscaping, according to Kevin Nursick, a Department of Transportation spokesman. Mr. Nursick said the department maintains a file with some 700 locations seeking noise abatement. ''Sound barriers are a very heated issue,'' he said. ''They are greatly in demand, but they are extraordinarily expensive to erect.''</p>
        <p>For prospective homeowners, new sound barriers could help seal the deal. John Schluter, a Microsoft executive who lives in Manhattan, said he hoped to buy a house about 400 yards from I-95 in Westport.</p>
        <p>''I love the property, but I'm struggling with the noise,'' he said. ''It's less of an issue about the value than about the peace and quiet. I'm moving from the city to the suburbs to avoid hearing sirens out my window. I don't want to hear 18-wheelers going by.''</p>

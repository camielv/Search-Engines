        <p>To the Editor: Regarding ''South Africa: In the Dark in the Park, With the Wild Things'' (Journeys, March 18): Rob Nixon makes clear his view that nighttime drives into the wildlife parks of Africa are a great idea and a boon for tourists wanting to see African animals. Doesn't he realize that these animals are being forced to deal with increasing human intrusion -- now not only during the day-- but at night as well, when humans would normally have retreated? Why do humans think it's their right to disturb wildlife wherever it exists? It would be nice to read about the negative impact of this sort of activity. In other words -- a balanced view.</p>

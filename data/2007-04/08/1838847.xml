        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia could be considered something of a C.E.O. His company? Kremlin Inc., overseer of a vast network of oil and banking concerns. As more of Russia's economy falls under state control, meetings in the Kremlin are becoming an important part of any deal maker's playbook; many analysts say the big deals cannot get done without such gatherings.</p>
        <p>So it should come as no surprise that the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, has written a letter to Mr. Putin asking for a meeting. The Kremlin's Web site announced the request last week. It was a Goldman analyst who first formulated the idea that the fast-growing so-called B.R.I.C. economies -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- would inevitably outpace today's largest economies.</p>
        <p>That implies plenty of investment banking opportunities. Just last month, Goldman joined a consortium of banks that agreed to lend $22 billion to Rosneft, the state oil company.</p>
        <p>Meeting with executives gives Mr. Putin an opportunity to display his strengths, notably a razor-sharp attention to detail, said Andrew B. Somers, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, who has orchestrated some of the meetings.</p>
        <p>''That leaves a positive impression of Russia'' with the executives, Mr. Somers said.</p>
        <p>(Goldman suffered a setback on Friday when a fire in a Moscow high-rise destroyed part of its office; no one was hurt.)</p>

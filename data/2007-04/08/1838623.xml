        <p>SHWAM--Ruth, born and raised in Brooklyn, died April 2, at age 87. She was the beloved mother of Paula and Marcy; GM of Donna, Marjie, Matthew, Luke and Daniel; GG of Ariel, Talia, Andrew, Ruth Zoe, Eliana, Danny, Lena, Jonah and William; and matriarch of so many more. As the last surviving member of the storied Shwams of Brooklyn and Newark, she leaves with us the memories and hopes of a remarkable family. Strong of mind and heart, and fiercely loyal to her family, Ruth brightened the lives of all those around her. She will be sorely missed as she moves on to join her beloved Danny.</p>

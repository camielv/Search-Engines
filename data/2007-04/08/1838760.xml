''They're great for going from daytime to clubbing, but you've got to have the body,'' said Maggie Wachsberger, whose Los Angeles boutique Malgosia, (323) 782-9188, can't keep Serfontaine's disco-inspired jean jumpsuit ($255) in stock. Pair it with stilettos and Pilates-toned legs and you've got a look.</p>

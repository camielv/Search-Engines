        <p>During Semana Santa, the Holy Week before Easter, it is customary among Latin American Catholics to refrain from eating red meat in favor of fish. Even so, the carnicerías, or butcher shops, of Jackson Heights, Queens, were bustling last week with Hispanic customers tempted by glossy lobes of liver and super-thin slices of top round steak.</p>
        <p>The carnicerías, where meat is carved and sold just as it is in the old country, are a sign of a year-round culinary tradition, as are the empanadas and roast chicken brought by the Colombians, Argentines and other Latin American immigrants in the area. But they are a tradition becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Butchers who are skilled in satisfying the preferences of their pan-Latin clientele are hard to find because of competition for their small numbers.</p>

        <p>During Semana Santa, the Holy Week before Easter, it is customary among Latin American Catholics to refrain from eating red meat in favor of fish. Even so, the carnicerías, or butcher shops, of Jackson Heights, Queens, were bustling last week with Hispanic customers tempted by glossy lobes of liver and super-thin slices of top round steak.</p>
        <p>The carnicerías, where meat is carved and sold just as it is in the old country, are a sign of a year-round culinary tradition, as are the empanadas and roast chicken brought by the Colombians, Argentines and other Latin American immigrants in the area. But they are a tradition becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Butchers who are skilled in satisfying the preferences of their pan-Latin clientele are hard to find because of competition for their small numbers.</p>
        <p>On 37th Avenue, the strip where these butcher shops are clustered, Fernando Gomez, the owner of the popular Carnicería Hispanoamericana near 89th Street, says it can take months to find qualified replacements for the 10 employees who buzz behind the meat counter in brightly colored baseball caps.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I have to wait a month or two or even three to find someone,'' said Mr. Gomez, a 52-year-old Colombian, who wore a white coat spattered with blood.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Gomez's shop, customers line up in front of a glass counter that spans the length of the store and displays beef hearts, pigs' feet, ox tails, slippery-looking strands of intestines and spongy sheets of stomach lining.</p>
        <p>To serve these customers, a Latino butcher not only needs to know how to carve an animal. He must also interpret what the customer really wants. When an Argentine asks for ''peceto,'' a Colombian ''muchacho'' and a Brazilian ''lagarto,'' they are all asking for the same piece of meat: the beef eye of round, better known to English speakers as pot roast.</p>
        <p>When qualified butchers aren't available, Mr. Gomez must train new employees from scratch. So must Jamie Salazar, a 44-year-old Colombian who owns La Boina Roja butcher shop and steak house on 37th Avenue at 82nd Street.</p>
        <p>''When a person doesn't know anything, it's hard,'' Mr. Salazar said. ''The first thing you have to teach them is not to cut off their fingers.''</p>
        <p>Keeping skilled employees is another challenge. At the Argentine-operated Don Francisco Butcher and Deli, on 37th Avenue at 85th Street, Alejandro Cantagallo, one of the owners, said his employees often migrate to better paying jobs at supermarkets once they have been trained.</p>
        <p>For him, the scarcity of skilled butchers is a sure sign that his profession is dying.</p>
        <p>''Butchers are going the way of shoemakers,'' said Mr. Cantagallo, 28. ''We're essentially becoming dinosaurs.''</p>

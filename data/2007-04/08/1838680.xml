        <p>WIDESPREAD development and stratospheric real estate prices have dimmed prospects for land trust acquisitions in the southwestern part of the state, so when given a chance to create a 16-acre nature sanctuary in Rowayton, preservationists jumped at it.</p>
        <p>But to set the deal in motion, they must raise $4.3 million by June 1. That's the cost of the 2.1-acre Hart estate, the prime link in a chain of four conservation properties that will create a greenbelt of shoreline, marsh and meadow on Farm Creek, an inlet off Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>''Rowayton is going through a building boom, and there is very little open space left,'' said Peter Scull, co-chairman of the Campaign for Farm Creek Preserve. ''This is our chance to take a beautiful property overlooking a pristine tidal marsh and have it preserved forever.''</p>
        <p>The marsh is home to native plants, yellow-crowned night herons, snowy egrets and other wildlife.</p>
        <p>The fund-raisers acknowledge that their goal is a long shot. ''It's like rolling a ball uphill, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth the effort,'' said Marny Smith, president of the Norwalk Land Trust, a partner in the endeavor.</p>
        <p>The strategy -- using smaller pieces to amass a larger whole -- is one that land trust administrators favor now that donations of large parcels are scarce.</p>
        <p>''If we can increase the size of an existing preserve, that's almost our first priority,'' said Bruce LePage, executive director of the Aspetuck Land Trust, which tries to preserve open space and owns land in Easton, Fairfield, Weston and Westport. ''Try to start small and make it bigger. If you can get it up to 10, 11 or 12 acres, that's the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. LePage said he was excited over a potential donation of 1.2 acres on Sherwood Mill Pond. The property, rich in bird life, backs up to Sherwood Island State Park. The owner's only motive is to see it preserved, said Mr. LePage, adding that people like that are rare. (He would not reveal the owner's name because the deal was pending.)</p>
        <p>More typical, said Percy Lee Langstaff, chairwoman of the Stamford Land Conservation Trust, is that ''the older generation wants to leave property to their children, but the children are more interested in 'cookie-cuttering' the whole thing and getting the money.''</p>
        <p>With land values soaring in much of the state, desirable properties are out of reach for many of the 128 land trusts in Connecticut. ''If you're competing against developers and the person doesn't have a philanthropic streak, it's damn near impossible to purchase land,'' Mr. LePage said.</p>
        <p>The Farm Creek project started when a resident, Charles Schoendorf, bought the Hart estate last year and offered to sell it to the preservationists at cost. They hope to retain a stone barn on the site as a nature center and demolish the residence.</p>
        <p>The multistep plan included securing a conservation easement on March 13 from the Norwalk Common Council for a neighboring 10-acre peninsula. To the north and east are existing Norwalk Land Trust holdings. Rowayton's elected representatives, the Sixth Taxing District commissioners, have allocated $125,000 for the effort and indicated they would match that next year.</p>
        <p>Keeping the creek free from further development benefits Long Island Sound, Mr. Scull said. Although the task is daunting, he said, ''it's an important thing to do for our children and grandchildren.''</p>

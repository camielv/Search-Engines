        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for ''Accepting an Identity, and Gaining Strength,'' by Michael Winerip (Parenting, April 1). You do the youth of America, and their families, a great service; I pray that more and more people will come to accept that we are who we are and that love and support are what we all need, regardless of our sexual orientation or any other God-given characteristic.</p>

        <p>Thank you for ''Accepting an Identity, and Gaining Strength,'' by Michael Winerip (Parenting, April 1).

        <p>Walter Foery  New Haven</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for the poignant and compelling article about Zach O'Connor. It succinctly described his pain and suffering in the closet, while sharing his spiritual liberation and self-acceptance after ''coming out'' at 13.</p>
        <p>Michael Winerip gently describes Zach's loving and supportive family. The sad reality is that many gay youth are met with hostility and banishment upon expressing their truth.</p>
        <p>Gay youth are still, tragically, an all too large percentage of the homeless in their age group, and the suicide rate of gay youth is still well above the national norm of straight youth. Yet today's youth do have resources such as the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network and the Trevor Project.</p>
        <p>I hope we can look to a time in America when every ''Zach'' can express his or her sexual orientation with honesty and integrity.</p>
        <p>Jim McGreevey  Plainfield, N.J.</p>
        <p>The writer is the former New Jersey governor.</p>

        <p>Editorial on New Jersey Gov Jon Corzine's contradictions when it comes to political reform; notes that while he is setting highest of standards by pushing Legislature and state agencies to eliminate even appearance of conflicts of interest, he is resisting demands by Republicans and others to come clean about gifts to Carla Katz, labor leader he once dated</p>

        <p>When it comes to political reform, Gov. Jon Corzine is a contradiction.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, he is setting the highest of standards by pushing the Legislature and state agencies to finally eliminate even the appearance of conflicts of interest. On the other, he is doggedly resisting demands by Republicans and others to come clean about gifts to a labor leader he once dated.</p>

        <p>When it comes to political reform, Gov. Jon Corzine is a contradiction.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, he is setting the highest of standards by pushing the Legislature and state agencies to finally eliminate even the appearance of conflicts of interest. On the other, he is doggedly resisting demands by Republicans and others to come clean about gifts to a labor leader he once dated.</p>
        <p>When he was a senator, Mr. Corzine had a relationship with Carla Katz, president of a union local representing 9,000 state employees. The relationship broke off before Mr. Corzine ran for governor in 2005. Mr. Corzine acknowledged at the time that he had forgiven a $470,000 loan to Ms. Katz to buy a house in Hunterdon County.</p>
        <p>He has since acknowledged that he gave Ms. Katz additional gifts. Although an aide says the gifts were all given before the fall campaign in 2005, the governor will not say what they were or how much they were worth. What we also know is that Ms. Katz, who earns $103,000 in her union job, bought a $1.1 million condominium in the Hoboken building where Mr. Corzine lives and is spending $500,000 to renovate the Hunterdon County house.</p>
        <p>None of this seems illegal, and the U.S. attorney, a Republican, has said so. Mr. Corzine portrays the issue as a matter of personal privacy. But as a chief executive whose job requires him to negotiate with Ms. Katz in her role as union representative, he has to be held to a higher standard. Ms. Katz's local is one of only two opposing a proposed agreement with state workers, but that does not dispel the appearance of a conflict of interest. Mr. Corzine has the power to make sure that Ms. Katz and her union get favored treatment. That is one reason he needs to eliminate suspicions of impropriety. The other is to set a good example.</p>
        <p>To his credit, Mr. Corzine has now asked his ethics advisors to review whether recent contract negotiations were tainted by his prior relationship. But given the stakes, Mr. Corzine should promptly disclose exactly what gifts he gave Ms. Katz, how much they were worth and whether he continued to send them after the relationship had ended.</p>

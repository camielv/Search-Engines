        <p>One important item that hit the cutting room floor recently when New York lawmakers produced a new state budget was the Bigger, Better Bottle Bill. This bill -- known as the BBBB in Albany -- would make one of the state's best environmental laws even better. A bill like the BBBB that cuts down on litter, encourages recycling, saves natural resources and provides funds to help the environment should be an easy step for New York's legislators and Gov. Eliot Spitzer.</p>
        <p>Right now, however, the bottle redemption bill itself needs to be redeemed. Many lawmakers have been wanting to pass the bill, a perfect fit for those in both parties who label themselves environmentalists. But the bill faces powerful lobbyists from the beverage industry who have been working against it for years because they earn millions of dollars when consumers fail to redeem their bottles and cans.</p>

        <p>One important item that hit the cutting room floor recently when New York lawmakers produced a new state budget was the Bigger, Better Bottle Bill. This bill -- known as the BBBB in Albany -- would make one of the state's best environmental laws even better. A bill like the BBBB that cuts down on litter, encourages recycling, saves natural resources and provides funds to help the environment should be an easy step for New York's legislators and Gov. Eliot Spitzer.</p>
        <p>Right now, however, the bottle redemption bill itself needs to be redeemed. Many lawmakers have been wanting to pass the bill, a perfect fit for those in both parties who label themselves environmentalists. But the bill faces powerful lobbyists from the beverage industry who have been working against it for years because they earn millions of dollars when consumers fail to redeem their bottles and cans.</p>
        <p>Until recently, anti-bottle-bill forces helped convince a number of key legislators -- including the State Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno -- that this bill was really a new tax on those who consumed bottled beverages. That seemed to change with the election of Mr. Spitzer, who has promised to support the better bottle bill. And after Mr. Spitzer and legislative leaders dropped the bill from this year's budget negotiations, the governor made it clear that he still hoped the bill would be passed this session.</p>
        <p>Over all, the present bill is a good one that does not need another legislative overhaul. It adds to the list of bottles that can be returned for a nickel to include water, iced tea, sports drinks and juice. (Have you ever noticed that most of the containers along the roadside or in the rivers once contained water, iced tea, sports drinks or juice?)</p>
        <p>Right now only bottles for carbonated soft drinks, sparkling water, beer or wine coolers can be redeemed. But even that limited coverage has resulted in the return or recycling of more than 90 billion cans and bottles since the law took effect 25 years ago.</p>
        <p>That the new bill would cover more containers worries owners of smaller grocery stores, who don't want their stores to become mini-recycling centers. The bill would increase the stores' handling fee to 3.5 cents a bottle from 2 cents and allows smaller stores in New York City to impose limits on their customers.</p>
        <p>The bill is expected to add at least 3.5 billion cans and bottles to the recycling bins each year. And the money forfeited when people fail to redeem their bottles and collect their nickels would provide over $100 million a year to clean up the environment. Right now those unclaimed funds stay with the distributors and beverage industry, which helps explains their resistance to this bill.</p>
        <p>It is time for New York's lawmakers to update the good old bottle bill to make it better, enlarging its scope and giving those unclaimed nickels back to the public, where they belong.</p>

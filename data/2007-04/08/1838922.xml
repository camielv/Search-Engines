        <p>Two people were in critical condition last night following two hit and runs, one in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn, according to the police.</p>
        <p>The first victim, Michael Moquette, 24, was struck by a silver Nissan sedan shortly before 5 a.m. yesterday on Amsterdam Avenue near 168th Street in Washington Heights, the police said.</p>
        <p>According to the police, Mr. Moquette was about to go into La Caridad Restaurant when he and his friends started arguing with three other men. Those three men then got into the Nissan, which was parked on the northbound side of Amsterdam Avenue. The driver of the car revved the engine and made a sudden U-turn, the police said.</p>
        <p>A witness, Geraldo Fernandez, 34, said he had just gotten out of a cab when he saw the car heading for Mr. Moquette and two of his friends, who were standing in a southbound lane of Amsterdam Avenue. Mr. Moquette's friends managed to leap out of the way, Mr. Fernandez said, but Mr. Moquette did not.</p>
        <p>''He hit him dead on,'' Mr. Fernandez said.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Moquette dropped to the ground, his head bounced off the curb, Mr. Fernandez said, and the Nissan sped off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moquette's friends put him in a cab and took him to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital. He was in critical condition yesterday, breathing with a respirator, and had to be revived twice by hospital staff members because his heart stopped, Mr. Moquette's relatives said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moquette grew up in Inwood and worked at a cinema, his sister Denise Moquette said.</p>
        <p>''He's brain-dead. That's what the doctor told me,'' said Raymond Ruiz, 47, one of Mr. Moquette's uncles. He was one of the dozens of friends and relatives who filled the hospital waiting room.</p>
        <p>A second hit and run occurred shortly after 7 a.m. yesterday in Brooklyn, according to the police.</p>
        <p>A 25-year-old woman, whose name was not released, was driving a 2000 Yamaha motorcycle south on Kent Avenue near the Brooklyn Navy Yard when she was struck by a black sport utility vehicle heading east on Flushing Avenue, the police said.</p>
        <p>The driver of the S.U.V. fled the scene, and the woman was taken to Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, where she was in critical condition yesterday, the police said.</p>
        <p>No arrests have been made in either case.</p>

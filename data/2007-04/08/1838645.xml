        <p>Janice Lichter letter on Michelle Higgins' March 25 Practical Traveler column warns those with allergies about staying at pet-friendly hotels</p>

        <p>To the Editor: I just read ''Hotel Trends: The Latest Amenity: A Hypoallergenic Room'' (Practical Traveler, March 25) by Michelle Higgins. As one who has had lifelong food and environmental allergies, I say ''bravo.'' Readers should know, however, that some hotels now permit pets in guest rooms. I had a recent reservation at a hotel in Boca Raton, Fla., which was under new management. Upon checking my hotel reservation before departure, I learned that cats and dogs were permitted to stay in guest rooms. I was assured by the desk clerk that the ''rooms are cleaned thoroughly'' after checkout. But cat dander becomes a permanent fixture; there is no way, short of demolition, that these rooms can be restored to their original dander-free state. Those with cat allergies could develop breathing difficulties upon entering a dander-filled room.</p>
        <p>Since many hotel guests do not appear to be aware of the current trend to allow pets in rooms, I recommend that travelers inquire about a hotel's pet policy before making reservations.</p>

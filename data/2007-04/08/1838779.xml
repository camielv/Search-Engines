        <p>Community Board 12 member Zead Ramadan proposes tearing down dangerously decrepit old concrete-and-steel stairway between Edgecomb Avenue and Harlem River Drive that scales Coogan's Bluff in Washington Heights; New York City Parks Department is investigating how much it will cost to renovate; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The zigzagging concrete-and-steel stairway between Edgecombe Avenue and the Harlem River Drive has a name; the half-obliterated bronze letters on the landing read ''The John T. Brush Stairway.''</p>
        <p>But to most residents of Washington Heights who use the decrepit old stairway near 157th Street, it is an anonymous, rickety convenience, a shortcut from the housing projects along the Harlem River to the stores and subway stations of Broadway, scaling the rocky promontory known as Coogan's Bluff.</p>

        <p>The zigzagging concrete-and-steel stairway between Edgecombe Avenue and the Harlem River Drive has a name; the half-obliterated bronze letters on the landing read ''The John T. Brush Stairway.''</p>
        <p>But to most residents of Washington Heights who use the decrepit old stairway near 157th Street, it is an anonymous, rickety convenience, a shortcut from the housing projects along the Harlem River to the stores and subway stations of Broadway, scaling the rocky promontory known as Coogan's Bluff.</p>
        <p>''It's dangerous at night because there's no light,'' said Columbus Van Horn, a resident of Polo Grounds Houses, as he clambered over the fence at the stairway's upper end the other day. ''But to save time, you take a chance.''</p>
        <p>These days, the Brush Stairway is in terrible disrepair. Its landings are matted with garbage, its iron guardrails are missing, its supports are decaying and its ornate lampposts stand headless. A low, sagging fence protects the lower end of the stairway, and no-trespassing signs are posted at each end.</p>
        <p>Old-timers know the staircase as the last remnant of the Polo Grounds, the stadium that once sat below the bluff. The New York Giants won the National League pennant there on Oct. 3, 1951, a game that ended with the Bobby Thomson home run sometimes known as the Miracle of Coogan's Bluff.</p>
        <p>John Brush was the team's owner from 1902 to 1912, and he rebuilt the Polo Grounds after it was destroyed by a fire in 1911.</p>
        <p>Now, the stairway that bears his name is in such bad shape that there have even been calls for tearing it down. At a meeting a few weeks ago, a member of Community Board 12, Zead Ramadan, proposed doing just that.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'To tell you the truth, why don't we cut out that second landing, make a plaque out of it, and then destroy the staircase, which doesn't serve any purpose anymore,' '' Mr. Ramadan recalled last week. The meeting was reported in The Manhattan Times, a community newspaper.</p>
        <p>But the city's Parks Department, which in the past decade has done little on behalf of the stairway, is now determined to save it.</p>
        <p>''We're investigating how much it will cost to renovate it,'' said William Castro, the department's Manhattan borough commissioner. ''Then we'll go to the council member and see if we can't get it funded.'' According to Mr. Castro, an estimate in the early 1990s put the cost of restoring the stairway at $350,000.</p>
        <p>Any restoration might please the people who were struggling up the stairs on a recent rainy morning. ''It's going to fall eventually,'' said Jeffrey Wilson, a local teenager, as he made his way down a mud path that led to a break in the fence. ''They should fix it.''</p>

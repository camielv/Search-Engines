        <p>DESPITE the recent killings of two auxiliary police officers and a restaurant worker in Greenwich Village, New York City continues to ride the largest and longest municipal winning streak in the recorded history of crime control in the United States. Alone among major cities, New York has enjoyed a decade and a half of steadily declining crime that puts it closer to the relatively low crime statistics it experienced in the early 1960s than to any more recent era. From 1990 highs, rates of homicide and robbery are down by about 75 percent, and the rates of all major crimes are now far less than half the level of 15 years ago.</p>
        <p>The city's crime drop remains amazing when you compare current crime levels not just with 1990 peak rates but the average year in the 1980s. Rates of robbery, homicide, burglary and auto theft are down two-thirds from the averages of two decades ago.</p>

        <p>DESPITE the recent killings of two auxiliary police officers and a restaurant worker in Greenwich Village, New York City continues to ride the largest and longest municipal winning streak in the recorded history of crime control in the United States. Alone among major cities, New York has enjoyed a decade and a half of steadily declining crime that puts it closer to the relatively low crime statistics it experienced in the early 1960s than to any more recent era. From 1990 highs, rates of homicide and robbery are down by about 75 percent, and the rates of all major crimes are now far less than half the level of 15 years ago.</p>
        <p>The city's crime drop remains amazing when you compare current crime levels not just with 1990 peak rates but the average year in the 1980s. Rates of robbery, homicide, burglary and auto theft are down two-thirds from the averages of two decades ago.</p>
        <p>The human arithmetic of New York's public safety achievement is also impressive. The homicide toll in 1990 was more than 30 deaths for every 100,000 residents; in 2004, that rate was down to 7.4 per 100,000. For a city of eight million, the difference between these two rates is about 1,800 lives saved. Every year.</p>
        <p>Three policing changes introduced after 1990 account for between a quarter and a half of the city's decline -- hiring more officers, increasing the aggressiveness of policing tactics and changing management systems -- but that doesn't tell the whole story.</p>
        <p>Indeed, at least half of New York City's drop in crime reflected a national phenomenon that had nothing to do with policing. What New York City has proved is that huge changes in crime and violence can happen without fundamental changes in urban populations, economic opportunity, housing, schooling, culture or transportation. This demonstration has destroyed the conventional wisdom of social science and the major assumptions of almost all scholars.</p>
        <p>The New York City of today much resembles the city at the beginning of the 1990s. The same demographic groups live in the city in about the same proportions as in 1990; housing and education conditions are similar; poverty and unemployment are down slightly, but income inequality is up.</p>
        <p>And these conditions were supposed to produce disaster. Ten years ago, conservative commentators said that the ''moral poverty'' of urban ghettos was spawning a generation of juvenile ''super predators.'' Critics on the left embraced a doctrine close to ''no peace without justice,'' arguing that structural inequalities and cultural dynamics of barrio and ghetto meant that violence would persist along with the urban status quo.</p>
        <p>But the crime wave of the super predators never happened. And chronic structural problems didn't short-circuit the crime drop either. There have been no major changes in education and economic mobility in New York, nor have the illegal drug market, hip-hop culture or the number of single-parent families altered to any significant extent.</p>
        <p>What the New York City experience teaches is that modest changes in urban environments can produce big changes in crime levels. Add up all of the changes in police numbers and tactics, in population, in economic opportunity and jobs, and you are talking about a city that is perhaps 10 percent different from what it was 15 years ago. But that 10 percent difference has made a huge difference in life-threatening crime. It turns out that our populations, the places they live and the institutions that touch their lives are not hard-wired to produce high and invariant levels of urban crime.</p>
        <p>A drop in violent crime is a special benefit for the poor because a clear majority of homicide victims are disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities. And that means when crime rates go down, the benefits of the decline are also concentrated on the poor and disadvantaged. The crime decline was probably the only significant public benefit of the 1990s that favored the disadvantaged rather than the privileged.</p>
        <p>The looser linkage between urban conditions and crime rates is good news for city residents because it allows us to address crime problems with bite-sized and pragmatic countermeasures. What we now know is that we don't have to change the world to change the crime rate.</p>

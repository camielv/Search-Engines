        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Both David Orr's apt critique of The New Yorker (''Annals of Poetry,'' March 11) and Dana Goodyear's excellent New Yorker article about Poetry magazine would have us believe that the battle for poetry's survival is being waged in the pages of magazines with, respectively, millions of subscribers or millions of dollars in Eli Lilly stock. This is not true. With few exceptions, the best contemporary poetry is being published by hundreds of small presses and little magazines across the country. To name just a few: Ugly Duckling Presse and Circumference in New York, Flood Editions and LVNG in Chicago, and Atelos and Hambone in the Bay Area. Readers who explore these venues will find that poetry is alive and well. Indeed, they'll find the spirit (and the financial uncertainty) of Ezra Pound's collaboration with Poetry magazine's founder, Harriet Monroe.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Orr attributes the disparagement of Amy Lowell as a ''hippopoetess'' to Ezra Pound. The original quote belongs to Witter Bynner, although Pound often repeated it.</p>

        <p>Connecticut appears to be edging ever closer to joining the national stampede known as the Super-Duper Tuesday presidential primary next Feb. 5, when 22 other states are planning to vote for a presidential candidate. That would be a mistake. Connecticut should stick with its current March 4 primary, alongside its regional neighbors, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Vermont, whose citizens will also vote that day.</p>
        <p>Advocates for change believe that the nominee will have been chosen by the March date. That prospect, and fears of a low turnout, prompted the General Assembly's Joint Committee on Government Administration and Elections to unanimously approve a bill moving up the state's primary date. The chairmen of the state Republican and Democratic Parties back the proposal, as does Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz.</p>

        <p>Connecticut appears to be edging ever closer to joining the national stampede known as the Super-Duper Tuesday presidential primary next Feb. 5, when 22 other states are planning to vote for a presidential candidate. That would be a mistake. Connecticut should stick with its current March 4 primary, alongside its regional neighbors, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Vermont, whose citizens will also vote that day.</p>
        <p>Advocates for change believe that the nominee will have been chosen by the March date. That prospect, and fears of a low turnout, prompted the General Assembly's Joint Committee on Government Administration and Elections to unanimously approve a bill moving up the state's primary date. The chairmen of the state Republican and Democratic Parties back the proposal, as does Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz.</p>
        <p>But nobody can predict what will happen Feb. 5. Many states are voting that day, but many people are running for president, too. If the vote is splintered among several candidates and no clear winner emerges, the real influence will go to the states that don't vote on Super-Duper Tuesday.</p>
        <p>If Connecticut joins the crowd, its votes will be of little consequence. Results from the big states will bury tallies from small states like ours. Connecticut's only chance of having any influence is a vote in March. Standing pat would also be a form of protest against a primary system that is quickly becoming an unholy mess.</p>
        <p>The Times favors a rotating regional primary to give every area of the country its say and also provide a testing ground that would give little-known candidates a fighting chance. No state, of course, wants to be the electoral caboose, voting when the results are a foregone conclusion. But for now, Connecticut should heed the advice of the New England poet Robert Frost, and take the road less traveled. It could make all the difference.</p>

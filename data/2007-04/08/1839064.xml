        <p>Panda Bear</p>
        <p>Blithe vocal harmonies carry songs through the vertigo of ''Person Pitch'' (Paw Tracks), the third solo album by Panda Bear of Animal Collective. The presiding spirit is Brian Wilson, especially in a song like the 12-minute ''Bros,'' which suggests ''Sloop John B'' adrift in a minimalistic limbo. The dense music is made largely from vocals and looped samples, and Panda Bear's pop sense is refracted through the repetitions of electronica and unfurled into the wide-open spaces of psychedelia. Instead of moving toward neat choruses, the melodies ripple outward and spread like reflections in a hall of mirrors. The album is occasionally self-indulgent but mostly enveloping. It suggests, as one song puts it, a ''wade into the deep end of the ocean.''</p>
        <p>Fountains of Wayne</p>
        <p>Suburban losers need love too. They just don't get it very often on ''Traffic and Weather'' (Virgin), the new album by Fountains of Wayne. One character falls for a clerk at the Department of Motor Vehicles who's asking for ''six forms of ID''; another is heartbroken when his Jersey girl is spotted ''with some guy wearing light blue Dockers pants.'' The band's real love is 1970s pop-rock, from Nick Lowe to Steely Dan to the Cars, and it treats the music just as it does the characters in the lyrics: with meticulous craftsmanship and a wry balance of compassion and scorn, parody and affection.</p>
        <p>'Colombia!: The Golden Age of Discos Fuentes'</p>
        <p>Latin rhythms that were fomented in New York, Puerto Rico, Cuba and elsewhere found a welcoming second home in Colombia, where they shared the dance floors with local sounds like the clip-clop beat of the cumbia and the tootling clarinet of the porro. ''Colombia! The Golden Age of Disco Fuentes -- The Powerhouse of Colombian Music 1960-76'' (Soundway) dips into the archives of the leading Colombian recording company to find home-brewed cosmopolitanism: everything from rumba to cowbell-driven fandango to echoes of African highlife to brass-band oompah to glimpses of 1960s rock, filled with sass and local pride.</p>
        <p>Mims</p>
        <p>In eras past, regional pop hit makers cultivated a national audience by name-dropping cities: ''They're dancing in Chicago! Down in New Orleans!'' The leisurely rapper Mims gives that tactic a technological upgrade on his hit ''This Is Why I'm Hot,'' which recognizes that there are hip-hop hotbeds outside his New York City base. When he mentions them, the slow-blipping production briefly recreates each regional trademark, whether it's the slowed-down vocals of Houston or the brittle beat of Bay Area hyphy. Sooner or later New York City gets a piece of everything.</p>
        <p>The Spiritualaires of Hurtsboro, Alabama</p>
        <p>''Singing Songs of Praise'' (CaseQuarter/Aum Fidelity) is the first album by the Spiritualaires of Hurtsboro, Alabama, a gospel group whose members have been singing together for half a century. Studio sessions from 2004 are interspersed with songs (and commercials) from the Spiritualaires' long-running Sunday-morning radio show. The sound is sparse -- five voices backed only by an electric guitar -- in music that encompasses sustained close-harmony songs, a bluesy shuffle and even a country gospel song. And the very basic recordings make the Spiritualaires sound eerie as well as devout.</p>
        <p>LCD Soundsystem</p>
        <p>The last thing anyone might expect -- or want -- from a dance music producer is evidence of an inner life. Leave it to James Murphy, alias LCD Soundsystem, to take that as a challenge on ''Sound of Silver'' (DFA/Capitol). He has had an improbably long run with his revival of stripped-down grooves from the early 1980s, and ''Sounds of Silver'' holds on to those telegraphic one-note bass lines, one-handed keyboards and tersely scrubbed guitar, adding a new sense of vocal melody and choruses that hint at Brian Eno songs. They carry lyrics like "Us v Them," about the transience of trendiness, and ''Time to Get Away,'' which starts like an invitation and then adds ''from you!'' It's even crankier and more self-conscious than LCD Soundsystem's first album, and, purely coincidentally, more danceable.</p>
        <p>I'm From Barcelona</p>
        <p>I'm From Barcelona is actually a Swedish band named after a phrase from an British comedy (''Fawlty Towers''), but it might as well be Canadian. Which is to say that its debut album, ''Let Me Introduce My Friends'' (Mute), comes across as a blithe community sing backed by all sorts of instruments -- banjo, trumpet, glockenspiel, harp -- like a euphoric version of Arcade Fire. I'm From Barcelona is determined to rejoice. Even a song called ''Chicken Pox,'' comparing childhood diseases to love gone wrong, finds a happy ending as Emanuel Lundgren and friends sing, ''You can't have it once you had it.''</p>
        <p>Andrew Bird</p>
        <p>Andrew Bird's voice is a mild, wistful tenor, but he can't stop envisioning disaster and desolation on his album ''Armchair Apocrypha'' (Fat Possum): plane crashes, religious inquisitions, environmental poisoning, war, loneliness, death. He's not whining; he's ruminating, obliquely, from within his own musical mechanisms. Onstage he assembles orchestral patterns with loops of violin (plucked and bowed), glockenspiel, guitar and his sweetly sustained whistling. In the studio he switches between those pointillistic vamps and songs that unfold instead of circling. Whether he's rocking as he ponders the nature of existence in ''Darkmatter'' or conjuring up a tango around a professor's solitude in ''Imitosis,'' Mr. Bird spins existential doubts into elegant confections.</p>

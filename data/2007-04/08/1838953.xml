        <p>The health risks of smoking may not be enough to persuade the State Legislature to authorize a $2-a-pack tax on cigarettes proposed last week by Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive.</p>
        <p>As part of his Healthy Nassau campaign, Mr. Suozzi joined with Assemblyman Earlene Hooper and Judith A.

        <p>The health risks of smoking may not be enough to persuade the State Legislature to authorize a $2-a-pack tax on cigarettes proposed last week by Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive.</p>
        <p>As part of his Healthy Nassau campaign, Mr. Suozzi joined with Assemblyman Earlene Hooper and Judith A. Jacobs, the County Legislature's presiding officer, in asking the State Legislature last Tuesday to allow the counties surrounding New York City and upstate Rensselaer County to impose cigarette taxes. He said he hoped the tax would dissuade youths from beginning to smoke and encourage smokers to quit.</p>
        <p>The money raised by the tax would not hurt either. Mr. Suozzi estimated that the tax could add $26.1 million to $30.7 million to county coffers.</p>
        <p>Not all state legislators from Long Island support the measure. Senator Kemp Hannon, a Republican from Garden City, issued a statement Tuesday saying he is ''opposed to creating new taxes.'' He instead supports raising the minimum age to buy cigarettes to 21 and increasing financial support to smoking-cessation programs, the statement said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suozzi countered by making a distinction between taxes, using the property tax as an example. ''You should be taxing things you're trying to discourage,'' he said. ''We don't want to discourage homeownership, we want to discourage smoking.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hooper, a Hempstead Democrat who is a sponsor of the legislation, said she anticipated that it would pass easily in the Assembly. She said she believed the tax would make smokers think twice before buying cigarettes.</p>
        <p>New York City imposes a $1.50-a-pack tax. Mr. Suozzi said that tax had reduced cigarette sales in the city, but had encouraged some smokers to buy cigarettes in Nassau County.</p>

        <p>THE Arizona Beverage Company is nearing a decision on whether to move its headquarters from Lake Success to Woodbury or to New Jersey.

        <p>THE Arizona Beverage Company is nearing a decision on whether to move its headquarters from Lake Success to Woodbury or to New Jersey. If Arizona Beverage goes, it will be the second company in recent months to announce intentions to move its headquarters from the village, which is in northwestern Nassau County; Canon USA said in November that it was going to Melville.</p>
        <p>Thomas J. Stringer, director of business incentives and site selection for Duff &amp; Phelps, a financial advisory company in Manhattan that was hired to analyze the move, said that the Hornell Brewing Company, Arizona Beverage's parent company, had been looking for a new site for a year and a half.</p>
        <p>He said Hornell was considering building a headquarters on a vacant 100,000-square-foot site in Woodbury, in far eastern Nassau, at a cost of $35 million, or renovating a building in New Jersey. He declined to name the site but said the New Jersey Department of Commerce had offered incentives.</p>
        <p>''We're within a two- or three-month time frame for making a decision,'' Mr. Stringer said.</p>
        <p>The Nassau County Industrial Development Agency has offered about $3.5 million in sales- and property-tax exemptions to induce Arizona Beverage to stay in the county, Mr. Stringer said.</p>
        <p>He said Arizona Beverage, which was founded in 1992 and produces iced-tea drinks, has about 120 employees who work in leased space of 38,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>Howard Fensterman, chairman of the Nassau Industrial Development Agency, said that should Arizona decide to move to Woodbury and take advantage of the incentives, ''it would be obligated to hire 50 more employees over three years.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Ronald S. Cooper of Lake Success said that Arizona and Canon were each looking to expand their business to their own campus. ''I don't think there is anything inherently wrong'' with the village, he said.</p>
        <p>Being 18 miles from Manhattan and within minutes of major highways, it is ideally situated for commercial offices, he said.</p>
        <p>Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group, said there was a ''fairly tight office market, so it is reasonable to expect that this space will be re-rented within a reasonable period of time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper said the landlord might seek a change in the assessed value to lower the tax bill only if the space remained empty for more than a year. Otherwise, he said, the village is not hurt by such corporate moves.</p>

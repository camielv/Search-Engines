        <p>KEEP YOUR NOUN ALIVE: Jeremy Scahill's muckraking book ''Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army,'' enters the nonfiction list at No. 9. It's a crackling exposé of the secretive military contractor Blackwater USA, which Scahill refers to as both ''the new Halliburton'' and ''the elite Praetorian Guard for the 'global war on terror.' '' Scahill writes frequently for The Nation; his book has been given a lift by an appearance on Terry Gross's NPR show and from intense buzz in the blogosphere. In his interview with Gross, Scahill used two phrases -- ''going Blackwater'' and ''keeping your noun alive'' -- that sound new, at least to my ears, and deserve to be better known. ''Going Blackwater'' refers to soldiers who flee the armed forces to work for better-paying private security firms. And Scahill employed ''keeping your noun alive'' this way: ''Blackwater guys ... were known for being very, very aggressive, and the whole point of their operation is to keep their noun alive, and their noun was Paul Bremer. It's now Zalmay Khalilzad, and so they're going to do everything it takes to not lose the noun.'' In other words: You're nobody these days unless you're somebody's noun.</p>
        <p>BURN, BUNNY: The fantasy novelist Kim Harrison -- her new book, ''For a Few Demons More,'' is No. 5 on the fiction list -- works in a genre that's been called ''sexy supernaturalism.'' Her stuff can read like a smoldering combination of Alice Waters and Ozzy Osbourne. In Harrison's books, half the world's population has been wiped out (and here's the Alice part) by a bad batch of genetically engineered tomatoes. With most of the humans gone (here comes the Ozzy part), witches, vampires and werewolves flourish. Harrison fans can go to her Web site and order ''burning bunny'' lapel pins, the better to spot one another in public. Why burning bunnies, exactly? Best to let Harrison explain: ''Burning bunnies are how I think of ideas,'' she writes on the site. ''Soft cuddly ideas that seem so innocent and sweet. ... They look so cute sitting on my desk. Until they flame up and start procreating into more ideas, which I frantically chase about my office until I corral them with pen and ink, jam them in a box and ship them off to New York.'' (No wonder Michael Bloomberg looks so jumpy these days.) These bunny pins, she adds, ''have the power to turn me into a squealing flake when I spot them in the crowd.''</p>
        <p>BEST-CASE SCENARIO: Gary Paulsen's novel ''Hatchet'' (1987), about a 13-year-old boy who survives in the wilderness after a plane crash with nothing but a hatchet, has become a young-adult classic: the ''Cast Away'' of the preteen set. But ''Hatchet'' is only now making its first appearance on a Times best-seller list -- because, it seems, the book helped save a life. According to the father of Michael Auberry, the 12-year-old Boy Scout who was lost in the North Carolina woods for four days last month, the book's lessons stuck with his son and helped him survive. ''I think he'd got some of that book in his mind,'' Michael's father told The Associated Press. The children's best-seller lists are available this week at nytimes.com/books.</p>

        <p>COULD it be that the mere presence of an English accent is enough to bewitch American audiences into overrating performances by British actors? That's the cheeky suggestion made recently by the British actor, novelist, critic and all-around cultural Renaissance guy Stephen Fry. ''I shouldn't be saying this -- high treason really -- but I sometimes wonder if Americans aren't fooled by our accent into detecting a brilliance that may not really be there,'' he told the British magazine Radio Times. ''I mean, would they notice if Jeremy Irons or Judi Dench gave a bad performance? Not that those two paragons ever would, but it's worth considering.''</p>
        <p>Blimey, that's food for thought, as is this: ''When American TV and movies call for a twist of limey in their cocktail, it's usually a character they're after -- supervillain, emotionally constipated academic, effete eccentric, that kind of thing.'' He may be on to something there. After all, didn't the creators of the three-part ''Die Hard'' franchise twice reach out for Britons -- Mr. Irons and Alan Rickman -- to play foils both evil and classy enough to square off against Bruce Willis?</p>

        <p>COULD it be that the mere presence of an English accent is enough to bewitch American audiences into overrating performances by British actors? That's the cheeky suggestion made recently by the British actor, novelist, critic and all-around cultural Renaissance guy Stephen Fry. ''I shouldn't be saying this -- high treason really -- but I sometimes wonder if Americans aren't fooled by our accent into detecting a brilliance that may not really be there,'' he told the British magazine Radio Times. ''I mean, would they notice if Jeremy Irons or Judi Dench gave a bad performance? Not that those two paragons ever would, but it's worth considering.''</p>
        <p>Blimey, that's food for thought, as is this: ''When American TV and movies call for a twist of limey in their cocktail, it's usually a character they're after -- supervillain, emotionally constipated academic, effete eccentric, that kind of thing.'' He may be on to something there. After all, didn't the creators of the three-part ''Die Hard'' franchise twice reach out for Britons -- Mr. Irons and Alan Rickman -- to play foils both evil and classy enough to square off against Bruce Willis?</p>
        <p>Clearly the game is afoot, as one of Mr. Fry's countrymen might put it. So in the same puckish spirit as Mr. Fry's provocation, three critics for The Times were asked to weigh in on the state of linguistic fair play in theater, film and television.</p>
        <p>LIKE most generalizations of its kind, this one is open to easy challenge. There is no shortage of exceptions that seem to disprove it. Kate Winslet? Daniel Day-Lewis? These are surely British actors -- one of them is the child of a poet laureate, by Jove -- but they don't really fit the profile, and not only because they are adept at disguising their accents and playing American. What about Clive Owen in ''Children of Men''? What about Samantha Morton? Alfred Molina?</p>
        <p>But if these examples challenge Mr. Fry's point, they also miss it. Because he is not really talking about British actors; they, after all (as well he knows), are just actors who happen to be British, some of them better at what they do than others. At least as far as movies are concerned, his quarrel seems to be with the phenomenon of Acting British, a whole different cup of, as it were, tea.</p>
        <p>There is a fine and noble tradition of British Acting -- read Kenneth Tynan on Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier for incisive analysis of its glories -- of which Acting British is both a legitimate descendant and a willful travesty. Acting British is in effect a form of camp or ministrelsy, in which certain vocal and gestural traits stereotypically identified as national characteristics are exaggerated for easy, pleasing effect: the rolling, quasi-Shakespearean diction; the imperious eyebrows; the ability to pace and turn as if the studio back-lot soundstage were the boards of the Old Vic.</p>
        <p>Acting British has been a staple of Hollywood productions since the days when a James Mason impression was the staple of second-rate stand-up comedy. When the script calls for a certain kind of heavy or wise man or dowager -- or, let's say, the faculty of a school for wizards -- the casting director opens the Acting British file and dispatches carrier pigeons in search of whatever Thompsons, Rickmans and McKellens might be available.</p>
        <p>The tradition of British actors slumming in Hollywood (or whoring, if you prefer) goes back a long way, and the practice has rarely damaged the prestige on which it trades. Could you have a Roman epic or an international spy thriller with an all-American cast? Probably, but things might get a little too, well, relaxed. What would ''Troy'' have been without Peter O'Toole and Brian Cox feasting on the dusty scenery? A bad movie, yes (it was that anyway), but a bad movie with an element of cheesy, self-conscious, self-mocking grandiosity stripped away.</p>
        <p>And it is that knack for superciliousness, that knowing wink, that British Actors, when Acting British, can be counted on to bring to a certain kind of big commercial movie. Think of Ian McKellen in ''The Da Vinci Code,'' spouting Dan Brown's nonsense to Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, both of whom seem paralyzed by the duty to take it all seriously. He is enjoying himself mightily, clattering around on his crutches, hollering at his manservant, and if his pleasure in some ways comes at the movie's expense, it also adds immeasurably to the audience's enjoyment of this drab and ponderous excuse for a suspense film.</p>
        <p>Stephen Fry is surely mistaken to impute the American appetite for Acting British to a sense of cultural anxiety or inferiority. Quite the contrary: it is pure imperial condescension, old chap. But his remarks do expose the absence of a countermovement, a reverse migration of Yanks flocking to Britain to Act American. That may have more to do with the state of cultural geopolitics than anything else, and in any case his teasing attempt to foment trans-Atlantic division risks distracting actors in both countries from the real threat: the Australians, who seem right at home in London or Los Angeles and whose diabolical plan for world domination in the field of English-language acting appears all but unstoppable.</p>

        <p>Lu Harlow, the food and beverage director at Yellowstone National Park, encountered an unexpected problem when she first put bison on one of the park's menus about three years ago. ''There is a buffalo on the emblem of employees' uniforms,'' she said. ''A bunch of people told me they felt too guilty to try it.''</p>
        <p>Not anymore. Last year the park sold some 42,000 pounds of game, primarily bison, to staff and the two million guests that passed through its 18 eating establishments. ''Once they learned the buffalo was farm raised and lower in fat than beef, it became a big hit,'' she said, adding that she now also served antelope sausages and elk medallions, as well as a bison top sirloin (all farm raised) at the Lake Hotel, the park's high-end restaurant.</p>

        <p>Not anymore. Last year the park sold some 42,000 pounds of game, primarily bison, to staff and the two million guests that passed through its 18 eating establishments. ''Once they learned the buffalo was farm raised and lower in fat than beef, it became a big hit,'' she said, adding that she now also served antelope sausages and elk medallions, as well as a bison top sirloin (all farm raised) at the Lake Hotel, the park's high-end restaurant.</p>
        <p>Gone are the days when the only food to be found at a National Park restaurant was Salisbury steak or fried chicken -- both covered in gravy. Xanterra Parks &amp; Resorts, the country's largest operator of restaurants in National Parks with more than 50 locations, is trying to feature local ingredients and, where it can, build green kitchens and dining spaces.</p>
        <p>At the Annie Creek Restaurant and Gift Shop, completed last May in a dense pine forest in Crater Lake National Park in Oregon, the company preserved as many trees as possible while building the 10,443-square-foot restaurant, which serves brick-oven pizzas, soups and salads.</p>
        <p>At Mount Rushmore, following a $1.9 million renovation of the food facilities, visitors can even watch their meal being prepared in an open kitchen.</p>
        <p>But it is not always easy being green. Ms. Harlow, who last year bought 200 pounds of goat cheese, 12,000 pounds of pork, and 40,000 pounds of Montana legend ground beef (all from local suppliers), put mahi-mahi on the menu only to find it had been added to the ''avoid list'' of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Program, which advises consumers about buying seafood only from sustainable sources. ''We took it off,'' she said. ''Yellowstone represents America and when it comes to sustainability we want to do the right thing.''</p>

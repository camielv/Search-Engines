        <p>Harold Jacob, general manager of East River Housing co-op on Lower East Side, concedes that, despite his threat of legal action against dog owners, New York City law prohibits tenants who openly keep pet for three months from being punished for breaking no-pet clause; photo (S)</p>

        <p>On March 16, the memo was slipped under each of the roughly 1,700 apartment doors in East River Housing, the complex of four red-brick co-op towers at the eastern end of Grand Street. ''Harboring of Dogs in Violation of Proprietary Lease,'' read the subject line. Residents were strictly enjoined not to ''harbor, possess or keep'' a dog, and were threatened with ''legal action'' if they persisted.</p>
        <p>By that evening, the panic among the leash-holding set was palpable. Dog owners conferred in huddles, and there was even talk of pooling finances for a lawyer.</p>

        <p>On March 16, the memo was slipped under each of the roughly 1,700 apartment doors in East River Housing, the complex of four red-brick co-op towers at the eastern end of Grand Street. ''Harboring of Dogs in Violation of Proprietary Lease,'' read the subject line. Residents were strictly enjoined not to ''harbor, possess or keep'' a dog, and were threatened with ''legal action'' if they persisted.</p>
        <p>By that evening, the panic among the leash-holding set was palpable. Dog owners conferred in huddles, and there was even talk of pooling finances for a lawyer.</p>
        <p>New homeowners in the complex, which is part of Co-op Village, have long been required to sign a notarized statement saying they do not own a dog and never will, on pain of eviction. Then someone found a copy of the city's ''Pet Law,'' which provides that no one who openly keeps a pet for three months can be punished for breaking a no-pets clause.</p>
        <p>Harold Jacob, the complex's general manager and the author of the memo, conceded as much.</p>
        <p>''If they keep the dog for 90 days,'' Mr. Jacobs said, ''you can't do anything about it.'' In fact, he said, the complex has not brought what he called a ''dog action'' in at least two years. But he still found it objectionable that some residents would claim not to own a dog when they obviously did. ''Those cooperators are lying,'' he said, ''and I don't think that's right.''</p>
        <p>''You know what?'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''I have fish. More or less, fish don't bother anybody.''</p>

        <p>Suprema Specialties Inc., of Paterson, N.J., appeared to be doing remarkably well selling all-natural Italian cheeses. The company's stock (its Nasdaq listing was CHEZ) rose when it reported strong sales results from July 2000 to January 2002.</p>

        <p>Suprema Specialties Inc., of Paterson, N.J., appeared to be doing remarkably well selling all-natural Italian cheeses. The company's stock (its Nasdaq listing was CHEZ) rose when it reported strong sales results from July 2000 to January 2002.</p>
        <p>But $400 million in sales were phony, and a federal jury last week convicted two of the company's top executives -- Mark Cocchiola, 51, of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., and Steven Venechanos, 48, of New Milford, N.J. -- of 38 counts, including conspiracy and bank, mail and wire fraud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cocchiola was the founder and Mr. Venechanos served as financial officer of the business, now defunct, which twice made Forbes magazine's list of the 200 best small companies and was among Fortune magazine's 100 fastest-growing public companies.</p>
        <p>Suprema's success, prosecutors said, rested on the fictitious sales, and by the second half of 2001, about 20 percent of its inventory was imitation cheese that was relabeled as higher-priced real cheese. The two men could face dozens of years in prison and millions of dollars in fines when they are sentenced on July 10.</p>

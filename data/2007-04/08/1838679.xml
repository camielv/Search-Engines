        <p>''KEIR, Dullea, gone tomorrow,'' Noël Coward once observed about the young actor he worked with in ''Bunny Lake Is Missing,'' a 1965 Otto Preminger film. But Keir today has gone through many tomorrows and is still here, still acting, still handsome at 70.</p>
        <p>So what does Mr. Dullea, a professional actor for 50 years, think of the pun Mr. Coward made on the set of ''Bunny Lake''? ''I was there -- he was just playing with words,'' he said.

        <p>''KEIR, Dullea, gone tomorrow,'' Noël Coward once observed about the young actor he worked with in ''Bunny Lake Is Missing,'' a 1965 Otto Preminger film. But Keir today has gone through many tomorrows and is still here, still acting, still handsome at 70.</p>
        <p>So what does Mr. Dullea, a professional actor for 50 years, think of the pun Mr. Coward made on the set of ''Bunny Lake''? ''I was there -- he was just playing with words,'' he said. ''It's not a very optimistic quote. But, man, you could do worse than getting a famous quote about yourself by Noël Coward.''</p>
        <p>Best known as ''Cmdr. Dave Bowman,'' the intrepid voyager with green eyes who outwitted an overreaching computer in Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968), Mr. Dullea most recently appeared in the revival of ''Mary Rose'' by J. M. Barrie at the Vineyard Theater in Manhattan. (''Oh my gosh, words just come out of his mouth like honey,'' said Paige Howard, 22, who played the title role in ''Mary Rose.'' ''He is so beautiful. No one tops Keir.'')</p>
        <p>Next year Mr. Dullea will appear in the film ''The Accidental Husband,'' married to Isabella Rossellini's character (one scene was shot at the First Church of Round Hill in Greenwich). And he played Angelina Jolie's father in ''The Good Shepherd'' (2006), directed by Robert De Niro and recently released on DVD.</p>
        <p>Mr. De Niro and Mr. Dullea both grew up in Greenwich Village and met there, when ''Robert De Niro was not Robert De Niro,'' Mr. Dullea said, his resonant voice reverberating inside his Fairfield home.</p>
        <p>His parents owned a bookstore in the Village, but he developed his taste for drama while doing plays at a boarding school in Newtown, Pa. He then went to Rutgers, but stayed less than a semester. His personal odyssey began when he ran away to San Francisco and became an apprentice carpenter. His parents suggested that he might want to study drama instead. He did just that -- first in San Francisco and later in New York at the Neighborhood Playhouse -- and got his Equity card in 1957.</p>
        <p>Trim, tall, wearing a turtleneck and jeans, Mr. Dullea talked about his career and about moving to Connecticut after a stint in Los Angeles. ''I didn't like living with actors in a company town,'' he said. So he moved to Westport in 1981 with his wife, the actress and director Susie Fuller. She died in 1998. It was Ms. Fuller's idea to start the Theater Artists Workshop of Westport (now in Norwalk). The couple created a place where professional actors, directors and writers could develop projects. Mr. Dullea remains a member but is no longer on the board. Chilton Ryan is now president.</p>
        <p>In 1999, Mr. Dullea married the actress Mia Dillon. They often act in plays together and are on the board of the Fairfield Theater Company. In 2001, the Fairfield Arts Council named Mr. Dullea its Artist of the Year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dullea made his film debut in ''Hoodlum Priest'' (1961), earned a 1963 Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer (shared with Omar Sharif and Terence Stamp) for his role in ''David and Lisa'' (1962) and acted opposite Lana Turner in ''Madame X'' (1966).</p>
        <p>But stage work is what he likes best. ''It's a different animal out there every night,'' he said. In 1969 he played a blind man on Broadway in ''Butterflies Are Free''; in 1992, he was F. Scott Fitzgerald in ''The Other Side of Paradise''; and last year he appeared with Ms. Dillon in ''Strings'' at the 78th Street Theater Lab in Manhattan. He has alsomade the rounds of Connecticut's regional theaters, including the Westport Country Playhouse, Stamford Theater Works and the Hartford Stage Company.</p>
        <p>''Becoming famous, noticed, all that stuff,'' is behind him, Mr. Dullea said. ''I'm more relaxed in my work than I've ever been.''</p>

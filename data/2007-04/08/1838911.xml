        <p>He was ousted, captured, tried and executed. But while the dictator may be gone, his legacy visibly lives on.</p>
        <p>There may be no starker reminder of Saddam Hussein's tyrannical rule than the potent symbols he left behind: scores of hubristic statues, murals, frescoes and other monuments he built all over Iraq to commemorate himself. While many were destroyed in the cathartic celebration and mob violence that followed the invasion, many others still remain, serving as a constant echo of Mr. Hussein's all-consuming authority and setting off the same range of emotions, from swollen Baath pride to desperate fear, that he inspired while he was alive.</p>
        <p>Now the nation is trying to figure out whether to save these objects as memorials to history or wipe them out. The debate goes to the core of a wounded nation's effort to redefine itself and reconcile with its painful past. In recent weeks, the matter has crystallized around Iraq's most famous landmark, the Victory Arch, two sets of gargantuan crossed swords held by giant fists modeled after Mr. Hussein's. The government had begun to tear it down, but an influential lobby, including the American Embassy, has blocked the dismantling for the time being.</p>
        <p>Since the monument was thrust onto the Baghdad skyline 18 years ago at the end of the Iran-Iraq war, it has been many things to many people: magnificent, vulgar, heroic, insulting, graceful, arrogant, inspiring, kitschy, bold and grotesque. It is now encompassed by the fortified Green Zone and visited mainly by American soldiers and foreign contractors, who stop for the obligatory photograph and climb up into the hollow interior of the fists.</p>
        <p>To many Iraqis, including the Shiite-led government, the monument -- popularly known as the Crossed Swords or the Hands of Victory -- is a ghastly reminder of a terrible era and should be destroyed.</p>
        <p>''Saddam built it for himself,'' said a Shiite officer in the Iraqi military, who gave only his first name, Manaf, out of concern for his safety. He marched at the parade ground the giant swords frame when he was in Mr. Hussein's army, he said, a memory he detests.</p>
        <p>''The monument means nothing to us now,'' he said bitterly.</p>
        <p>But to some Iraqis -- particularly supporters of Mr. Hussein -- it remains a national symbol and a source of pride.</p>
        <p>''It would be shameful to remove this monument,'' said Abu Ali, 30, a high school teacher living in Tikrit, the overwhelmingly Sunni city north of Baghdad where Mr. Hussein had his greatest base of support. ''It represents the Iraqi people, the pure Iraqi people.''</p>
        <p>The challenge is an emotional issue common to all countries that have undergone revolutionary change, including post-Nazi Germany, post-apartheid South Africa, Cambodia after the fall of Pol Pot and the former Eastern bloc countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>''When societies break down and identities clash, the symbols of those identities become especially important,'' said Louis Bickford, a political scientist at the International Center for Transitional Justice in New York. ''New regimes have essentially two choices: eliminate symbols or engage with them. This comes to the forefront when there is deep hatred and anger about the past.''</p>
        <p>At the center of the debate here is a government body called the Committee to Remove the Remains of the Baath Party and to Consider Building New Monuments and Murals, which was formed in 2005 and has a hit list of more than 100 artifacts from Mr. Hussein's era.</p>
        <p>The committee -- now a 10-member panel of Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds appointed by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki -- has already removed two items: a bronze mural in the Alawi neighborhood depicting the history of the Baath Party, and a monument in Mustansiriya Square honoring a group of Iraqi prisoners in the Iran-Iraq War.</p>
        <p>''Because Iraqis still have bad memories of the former regime and what Saddam Hussein did, we want to remove all of his traces,'' explained Kamel Nasser al-Zaidy, the committee's spokesman and a Shiite, who was jailed by Mr. Hussein because of his participation in an illegal political party.</p>
        <p>But some, among them Shiites and Kurds who suffered gravely under Mr. Hussein's rule, view the committee's effort as a blind, and possibly sectarian, attack on the country's heritage.</p>
        <p>''What do they want to do? Do they want to change history?'' asked Saad al-Basri, a Shiite and a professor of sculpture in the College of Fine Arts in Baghdad. ''The monuments should be considered as part of archaeology that speak to a specific era in Iraqi history. To remove them is wrong.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hussein built the Victory Arch to commemorate what he viewed as the definitive victory in the war against Iran in the 1980s. Construction began well before the end of the war, which had no victor.</p>
        <p>In a claim that is now impossible to verify, he said the stainless steel swords, crossing 130 feet in the air and each weighing 24 tons, were forged from the weapons of Iraqi soldiers who died in the conflict. The bronze fists and forearms, which punch upward through the earth, were based on plaster casts of Mr. Hussein's arms. He also incorporated into the monument hundreds of Iranian helmets recovered from the battlefield, many of them perforated with bullet holes.</p>
        <p>The two pairs of swords bracket a long parade ground, and during Mr. Hussein's reign, the site was a popular destination for school outings and family picnics. On ceremonial holidays, including July 17, the anniversary of the 1968 Baathist revolution, the Iraqi Army would march between the swords as Mr. Hussein observed from a reviewing stand.</p>
        <p>Early this year, Mr. Maliki quietly approved the dismantling of the monument at the request of the monuments committee, and on Feb. 19, a work crew wheeled cranes to the base of the arches and began unbolting their large bronze slabs.</p>
        <p>Word spread quickly, and by morning the site was swarming with people, including American contractors and workers from the American Embassy, some of whom tore Iranian helmets off the base as souvenirs.</p>
        <p>At the same time, critics of the dismantling began to lobby the Maliki administration to suspend the project. Among them was Mustafa al-Kadhimiy, a Shiite and former exile, and the Baghdad director of the Iraq Memory Foundation, which is dedicated to archiving Baathist artifacts as a way to help Iraqis understand and come to terms with the horrors of their past.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kadhimiy complained to Barham Salih, Iraq's Kurdish deputy prime minister. Mr. Salih said he agreed to serve as an envoy and took Mr. Kadhimiy's message to ''various people,'' among them Mr. Maliki and Zalmay Khalilzad, who was then the United States ambassador to Iraq.</p>
        <p>American officials eventually pressed Mr. Maliki to suspend the demolition while everyone considered the matter further. Work was halted and, for now, the Victory Arch remains.</p>
        <p>''It's not a question of beauty or ugliness,'' said Mr. Kadhimiy, while standing beneath the monument on a recent afternoon. ''It's a question of what we can learn from these things.''</p>
        <p>In the setting sun, the swords' elongated shadows stretched across the crowns of the palm trees toward the Tigris River. The bulbous hilts of the swords had been removed, and several bronze curved plates cut from the back of one of the fists lay on the ground like calcified orange peels.</p>
        <p>The Iraq Memory Foundation -- which was founded by Kanan Makiya, who wrote a book in 1991 about the Victory Arch -- is planning to build a museum and library on the site. According to Mr. Kadhimiy, the foundation holds a 40-year lease with the city of Baghdad for property that includes the monument.</p>
        <p>But Mohammad Tahir al-Tamimi, chairman of the monuments committee, said the foundation's lease was suspect and now under investigation by the government's integrity commission. He is furious, he said, at ''the interference'' of the American Embassy.</p>
        <p>The monuments committee is continuing with its plans to remove the scores of other items on its list, members said. The plan, they said, was to store most of the items in a warehouse in Baghdad with the possibility that they may one day become part of a museum.</p>
        <p>A majority of the Baathist symbols on the list are in predominantly Sunni areas of the north and west, where support for the central government is weak, potentially complicating the prospect of any removals.</p>
        <p>In Baghdad, once the epicenter of Mr. Hussein's monument building, most of the symbols have been defaced or destroyed, among them the enormous statue of the dictator in Firdos Square, pulled down by American soldiers on April 9, 2003. Of those that have survived, many, like the Victory Arch, are within the insulated confines of the Green Zone, including the Unknown Soldier Monument; several busts and heads of Mr. Hussein that adorned his palaces but which have been removed and stored by the Americans; and a statue of a founding member of the Baath Party, an American Embassy official said.</p>
        <p>The monuments committee wants to save one of the Victory Arch's four swords and melt the other three for new monuments, according to Mr. Tamimi, who envisions a Baghdad full of sculptures honoring dancers, poets, artists, the ''kings of ancient civilization'' and even the first American soldier killed in the Iraq war.</p>
        <p>The committee plans a new statue to replace the Victory Arch: a copy of Mr. Hussein's rifle, with the barrel tied in a knot.</p>
        <p>''The removal process of this committee,'' Mr. Tamimi said, ''is itself a form of rebuilding.''</p>

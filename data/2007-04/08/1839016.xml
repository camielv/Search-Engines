        <p>A profile on March 25 about the rare-book and archives dealer Glenn Horowitz referred incompletely to M.G. Lord, his first wife. Her last work in the field of political cartooning was some 15 years ago; she is known today as a writer.</p>
        <p>The profile also misstated the year that the University of Texas in Austin acquired the Watergate notebooks of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. It was 2003, not 2004.</p>

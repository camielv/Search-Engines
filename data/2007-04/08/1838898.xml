        <p>INTERNATIONAL 3-14</p>
        <p>North Korea Is Arming Ethiopia  Months after the United States pressed the United Nations to impose strict sanctions on North Korea because of the country's nuclear test, Bush administration officials allowed Ethiopia to complete a secret arms purchase from Pyongyang, according to American officials.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Hussein Monuments in Iraq  The Iraqi government is trying to figure out whether to save or destroy the many remaining statues and other monuments Saddam Hussein built all over Iraq to honor himself. The debate goes to the core of a wounded nation's effort to reconcile with its painful past. 1</p>
        <p>American fighter jets carried out an airstrike against Shiite militiamen in the Iraqi city of Diwaniya as battles continued in some neighborhoods there for the second straight day, American and Iraqi officials said.  10</p>
        <p>Crackdown in Zimbabwe  In response to the latest surge of political unrest in Zimbabwe, scores, perhaps hundreds, of people critical of President Robert G. Mugabe's rule are being cornered on sidewalks, hauled to jails or abducted from their homes in night raids and savagely beaten.</p>
        <p>14</p>
        <p>Cease-Fire Eroding in Gaza  Israeli Army helicopters fired at Palestinian militants in the northern Gaza Strip, killing one, the military said. It was the third Israeli military strike in Gaza in 10 days, indicating a further erosion of the cease-fire that was declared in November.</p>
        <p>6</p>
        <p>Rift Over U.N. War Trial  The war crimes trial for an ethnic Albanian former guerrilla commander who was briefly Kosovo's prime minister has created a stark divide between the case's prosecutors and diplomats from the United Nations and Western governments, who are usually the U.N. tribunal's biggest supporters.</p>
        <p>12</p>
        <p>NATIONAL 16-23</p>
        <p>Lessons of Heart Disease  Medical research has revealed enough about the causes and prevention of heart attacks that they could be nearly eliminated. But scientists' understanding of what causes heart disease and how to treat it often remains unknown or ignored.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Shifting Style for Obama  As Senator Barack Obama works his way across rural northern Iowa it is clear that he is not presenting himself the way he did when he first gripped Democrats two years ago.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>State Tax Revenue Down  State tax revenues around the country are growing more slowly this year and in some cases falling below projections, a result of the housing market slowdown that has curbed spending on real estateand other items.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Alternative for Costly Drugs  Senior members of Congress from both parties are working on legislation that could give consumers access to low-cost versions of drugs that now cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.</p>
        <p>22</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION 25-29</p>
        <p>Custody Battles' Casualties  Custody battles are rarely gentle affairs, but if someone is poor, such fights can carry an added frustration: waiting months to get a court-approved visit with their child. When judges order supervised visitation, neither the court nor other government agencies pay for the service, which is a growing national issue.  25</p>
        <p>Killings in Trenton  A rash of killings has shaken Trenton, a city of 85,000, and strained the resources of the Police Department. The authorities have attributed the violence to the availability of guns, to rivalry among gang members, or simply to the kind of bloodshed that often follows the narcotics trade. 25</p>

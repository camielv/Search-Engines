        <p>Excerpts from previously published reviews of restaurants near Easter Parade route along Fifth Avenue (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Easter finery will be on display today during the Easter Parade and Easter Bonnet Festival, along Fifth Avenue from 49th to 57th Streets. And culinary skill is on display at these fine restaurants, many of them recent additions to the area.</p>
        <p>ANTHOS  (212) 582-6900; 36 West 52nd Street (Fifth Avenue); $$$; Article: 3/7/07.  Michael Psilakis and Donatella Arpaia run this high-end Greek restaurant, where Mr. Psilakis seasons raw fish with fennel and ouzo; deconstructs skordalia, a garlicky dip, and turns it into a velvety soup; and cuts the richness of pork belly with an egg-and-lemon avgolemono sauce.</p>
        <p>BAR ROOM AT THE MODERN  *** [Rating: Three Stars]  (212) 333-1220; 9 West 53rd Street (Fifth Avenue); $$; Review 1/10/07.  Danny Meyer's restaurant in the Museum of Modern Art, the Modern, is divided into a dining room and this more freewheeling bar area, where the food is less expensive, though not really and truly cheap.</p>
        <p>The Bar Room doesn't have the dining room's view of the museum's sculpture garden, but it does have a more accessible, straightforward menu of Alsatian dishes so satisfying that the tradeoff is worth it. Among the highlights are liverwurst, Alsatian sausage and salmon.</p>
        <p>FIRESIDE  (212) 754-5011; 15 East 52nd Street (Madison Avenue); $$$; Article: 12/27/06.  Sam DeMarco is the chef for this restaurant in the Omni Berkshire Place hotel, where he is serving small plates like short-rib tacos, lollipop buffalo wings and mojito lamb chops and more substantial dishes of lusty seasonal food, including pork osso buco and diver sea scallop Wellington.</p>
        <p>GORDON RAMSAY AT THE LONDON  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 468-8888; The London NYC Hotel, 151 West 54th Street (Avenue of the Americas); $$$$; Review: 1/31/07.  You might expect Gordon Ramsay's debut New York restaurant to be brash and any of its shortcomings to be attributable to audacity, not timidity. But the dining room is coolly, even icily, elegant. The $90 that Mr. Ramsay charges for a three-course prix fixe is reasonable, given everything the restaurant provides: from croutons with foie gras and truffled cream cheese spreads at the start of a meal to a flurry of first-rate petits fours at the end.</p>
        <p>L'ATELIER DE JOËL ROBUCHON  *** [Rating: Three Stars]  (212) 350-6658; Four Seasons Hotel, 57 East 57th Street (Madison Avenue); $$$$; Review: 10/4/06.  L'Atelier's signature counter seating, the only option at its sleek Paris branch, shares space with about 10 tables. The menu offers unusual dishes whose exceptional refinement and seductiveness can't be denied, like a succulent piece of langoustine, deep-fried in a cradle of crunchy pastry so thin and delicate that the whole basil leaf between it and the langoustine's flesh is plainly visible.</p>

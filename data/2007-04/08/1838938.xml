        <p>As its women's basketball team kept winning in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, Rutgers kept winning off the court too.

        <p>The 59-46 loss to Tennessee in Cleveland did little to slow sales of the team's merchandise on the Rutgers campuses or to stop companies from seeking manufacturing contracts with the university, said Marybeth Schmutz, the assistant director for trademark and licensing at Rutgers.</p>

        <p>As its women's basketball team kept winning in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, Rutgers kept winning off the court too. Despite the team's loss in the championship game last Tuesday, sales of Scarlet Knights merchandise have ''been through the roof,'' university officials said.</p>
        <p>The 59-46 loss to Tennessee in Cleveland did little to slow sales of the team's merchandise on the Rutgers campuses or to stop companies from seeking manufacturing contracts with the university, said Marybeth Schmutz, the assistant director for trademark and licensing at Rutgers.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing a doubling in the submissions for women's products,'' she said. ''This visibility and the following they have are making them bigger, and we'll see an increase in demand for women's products.''</p>
        <p>The trademark and licensing office has already been busy following the football season last fall, capped by Rutgers's victory over Kansas State in the Texas Bowl in December. Usually heaviest in the summer, the offers and orders are now coming in year round.</p>
        <p>Once, Rutgers merchandise was available only on campus. But now, Ms. Schmutz said, it can be found in retail stores around the region, and the demand continues to grow.</p>
        <p>''It's really been incredible, phenomenal, amazing,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Cassandra DeMarshall, a junior from Mantua, was dismayed by the loss in the women's championship game but said the exposure for the university had been great. ''The recognition is all good,'' she said. ''People from California know who Rutgers is now.''</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed the article about Derek Jeter's quiet approach to leadership (''Public Figure, Private Leader,'' April 1). It is admirable that he leads by example and communicates directly with teammates instead of through the news media.</p>
        <p>But some may find his assertion that, ''It's not my job to change the way fans act,'' somewhat hypocritical, if unintentional. Jeter was defending his public nondefense of Alex Rodriguez throughout all the booing that Rodriguez endured last season. Fair enough. But fans don't forget how Jeter supported Jason Giambi when the boos were directed at him.</p>

        <p>I enjoyed the article about Derek Jeter's quiet approach to leadership (''Public Figure, Private Leader,'' April 1). It is admirable that he leads by example and communicates directly with teammates instead of through the news media.</p>
        <p>But some may find his assertion that, ''It's not my job to change the way fans act,'' somewhat hypocritical, if unintentional. Jeter was defending his public nondefense of Alex Rodriguez throughout all the booing that Rodriguez endured last season. Fair enough. But fans don't forget how Jeter supported Jason Giambi when the boos were directed at him.</p>
        <p>Perhaps one way to reconcile these seemingly contradictory actions is to understand what Ron Guidry, a former Yankees captain himself, means by a captain's needing to read the personality of each player. Jeter's relationships with Rodriguez and Giambi are very different, and it is up to Jeter to deal with them individually as he sees fit.</p>
        <p>Bruce Rogowski  Trumbull, Conn.</p>
        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter must be suffering from convenient amnesia because in 2005, when Jason Giambi was embroiled in baseball's steroid controversy, Jeter was outspoken in saying that the fans should give him a break. Perhaps Manager Joe Torre needs to step up to the plate and advise Jeter that it's time to put aside his petty differences and become a public leader by going to bat for Alex Rodriguez.</p>

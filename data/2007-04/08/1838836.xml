        <p>I was irritated, but not surprised, when I read about the reaction that residents of Hillcrest, Queens, were having to the proposal of a rehabilitation and detoxification center residing in their neighborhood (''No Welcome Wagon for a Rehab Center,'' April 1).

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was irritated, but not surprised, when I read about the reaction that residents of Hillcrest, Queens, were having to the proposal of a rehabilitation and detoxification center residing in their neighborhood (''No Welcome Wagon for a Rehab Center,'' April 1). Yet again, the resentment is evident when people are confronted with the unfamiliar, and it is clearly time for New Yorkers to become familiar with current substance abuse and alcohol treatment.</p>
        <p>Gone are the days of the commonly envisioned ''Bowery bum'' or ''street junkie.'' The people who receive treatment at places like Cornerstone are your teachers, bankers, mailmen or family members. Addiction is non-discriminatory; it can affect anyone, regardless of education, social upbringing or economic bracket. The grasp of addiction can cross all boundaries, and that is exactly why people need to examine what it is that makes them uncomfortable with drug treatment programs.</p>
        <p>Cornerstone Treatment Facilities Network has an excellent reputation in the field of addiction for its sincerity and determination in assisting its clients through the process of recovery. Their facility should be welcomed, not shunned.</p>

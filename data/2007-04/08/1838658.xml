        <p>Howard Goldberg reviews five 2002 Adam Suprenant red wines from Osprey's Dominion in Peconic (Long Island Vines column) (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In 2002, after one of the warmest growing seasons then on record, Adam Suprenant, the winemaker at Osprey's Dominion in Peconic, capitalized artfully on his red grapes. It couldn't have been hard; properly tended red grapes matured so perfectly that year that the region's best wines virtually made themselves.</p>
        <p>Both individually and as a group, five 2002 Suprenant reds that I tasted recently, light to medium bodied and produced only from Bordeaux-type grapes, have blossomed impressively. They are rewarding to drink today, and all promise years of further development.</p>

        <p>In 2002, after one of the warmest growing seasons then on record, Adam Suprenant, the winemaker at Osprey's Dominion in Peconic, capitalized artfully on his red grapes. It couldn't have been hard; properly tended red grapes matured so perfectly that year that the region's best wines virtually made themselves.</p>
        <p>Both individually and as a group, five 2002 Suprenant reds that I tasted recently, light to medium bodied and produced only from Bordeaux-type grapes, have blossomed impressively. They are rewarding to drink today, and all promise years of further development.</p>
        <p>Few consumers stop momentarily to study wine colors -- a mistake. The healthy ruby color in each of these reds seems to foretell the flavors to follow.</p>
        <p>Lovers of easygoing East End merlot will find the 2002 edition ($20) soft, plummy, succulent, mouth-filling and alive with hints of tobacco. If ever a North Fork merlot embodied the pleasure principle, it is this one.</p>
        <p>The 2002 cabernet sauvignon ($20), tempered with 17 percent merlot and composed with a light hand, is notably graceful. A dollop of black currant (cassis) and graphite aromas, a trait common to cabernet sauvignon, contribute to the satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suprenant's palate-filling 2002 cabernet franc ($24), made 100 percent from that grape, is captivating. Earthy and redolent of herbs and tobacco, it is one of the best North Fork examples of this genre I have encountered in years.</p>
        <p>A notch up the scale in price ($35) and quality, the reserve merlot (made 100 percent from the grape) is thoroughly winning. Juicy, meaty and soft, it virtually smolders in the glass.</p>
        <p>Osprey's aromatic Bordeaux-style blend ($35), predominantly merlot and named Flight, is no less appealing, though lighter in body and more graceful. Those not content with the basic richness of these wines can enhance them by decanting them and giving them a couple of hours of aeration.</p>
        <p>The 2002 reserve merlot and 2002 Flight are worth buying by the half-case (5 percent discount) or the full case (10 percent discount). Both can be drunk now and also laid away for further visits.</p>

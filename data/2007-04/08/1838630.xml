        <p>TRIMINGHAM--Shorty, 87, noted yachtsman, parliamentarian, and photographer. DeForest Wheeler Trimingham, C.B.E., of Bermuda died at his home, in Paget, on March 30, 2007, of acute leukemia. Born in 1919 to a family of yachtsmen, the sailor known worldwide simply as Shorty became one of the most successful sailors on the international circuit. In 1954, he was the first non-Englishman to win the Prince of Wales Cup, the top prize of the International 14s. He represented Bermuda at the 1960 Olympics in Italy. In ocean racing, he competed in countless Bermuda and Fastnet Races and was co-founder of the Onion Patch series. He served as Member of Parliament from 1958 to 1980 and as Bermuda's Minister for Tourism from 1972 to 1977. In 1978, he was made Commander of the British Empire by the Queen of England for his services to the island of Bermuda. As merchandising manager for Trimingham Bros., he traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia. These travels inspired his eventual return to the art of photography. A collection of his photographs titled, ''Buddha: The Living Way'' was published by Random House in 1998, with a foreword by the Dalai Lama and text by Pico Iyer. He leaves behind his wife, Dorothy, daughter, Barrie Trimingham, and three grandsons, Stephen, Peter, and Thomas VanDyck.</p>

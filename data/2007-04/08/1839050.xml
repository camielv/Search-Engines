        <p>Should you happen to wander into Dance Theater Workshop's gallery space this month, be prepared to be confronted with your own likeness, or some version of it. In ''A CURE FOR SURVEILLANCE,'' Jonah Bokaer and Liubo Borissov have used motion-capture technology to record images of the dancers Michelle Mola and Douglas Letheren. This archive of movements will be intertwined with live images of people entering the gallery; that means you, boys and girls. ''Surveillance'' inaugurates the workshop's Gallery Installation Fellowship program, so expect more experiments in the coming months. Monday through April 28, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, with a public reception on Friday from 6 to 7:30 p.m., 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-007, 2rem.net/projects/cure4s; free.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bokaer and Mr. Borissov toy with the fear that somebody is always lurking and watching, a new work by Amanda Loulaki and Short Mean Lady goes in the opposite direction, exploring the fear of emptiness. In ''DELIRIUM, OR THAT TASTE IN MY MOUTH,'' Ms. Loulaki, a Crete-born choreographer, working with the performers Carolyn Hall, Rebecca Serrell and Pedro Osorio, plays with a nonlinear structure, making free association more important than more traditional notions of context and narrative. Thursday through Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15.</p>
        <p>Two days before Palissimo presented the premiere of ''LE PETIT MORT/NOW IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE'' at P.S. 122 in December, the dancer Ellen Cremer injured herself falling off a ladder. On opening night another dancer, Saar Harari, tore his meniscus, and the rest of the run had to be canceled. Perhaps the choreographer, Pavel Zustiak, should consider a more hopeful title for his next dance. But first, ''Le Petit Mort'' lives again. In addition to Mr. Zustiak and his fine ensemble of dancers, including the terrific Gina Bashour, the dark, sexually charged show boasts contributions from the video artist Tal Yarden and an accompanying exhibition by the photographer Jose Aragon. Thursday through next Saturday at 8 p.m. and next Saturday and Sunday at 4 p.m., 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org; $15 to $20.</p>

        <p>A review on March 18 about ''The First Man-Made Man: The Story of Two Sex Changes, One Love Affair, and a Twentieth-Century Medical Revolution,'' by Pagan Kennedy, refers incorrectly to Michael Dillon, the main subject of the book, who was born a woman. Dillon's sex change is considered the first of the modern era because of its surgical sophistication and its early use of testosterone, starting in 1938. But he was not ''the first person on record to undergo surgery to change his gender.'' (Records of surgery to alter sexual characteristics go back to ancient times.)</p>

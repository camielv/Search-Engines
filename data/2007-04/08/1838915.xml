        <p>Unrelated shootings early yesterday in the Bronx left two men dead and three people injured, the police said. No arrests had been made by late yesterday.</p>
        <p>One shooting occurred about 2 a.m. at 174th Street and Morris Avenue in the shadow of the Cross Bronx Expressway. Two men who were brothers-in-law argued with a third man in a Kennedy Fried Chicken and Pizza restaurant, the police said, and the dispute continued outside.</p>
        <p>The third man shot the two brothers-in-law, the police said. Jose Viera, 24, was hit once in the chest, they said, and his brother-in-law, who is 17 and whose name was not released, was shot once in the head. Both were taken to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, where Mr. Viera was pronounced dead.</p>
        <p>The 17-year-old, whose nickname is Bolo, underwent surgery to his face, according to friends who gathered at the hospital. He was in critical condition, the police said.</p>
        <p>It was not clear what the men had been arguing about, but several people who stood outside the restaurant late yesterday morning shook their heads in disgust, and one person vowed to exact revenge.</p>
        <p>A makeshift memorial, made of a cardboard box filled with 15 lighted candles and a red bandanna, was set up on the sidewalk where the two men had been shot.</p>
        <p>Another shooting occurred at 3 a.m. on Sedgwick Avenue in Kingsbridge Heights.</p>
        <p>The victim, Arquelio Rodriguez, 32, who lived in an apartment several buildings away, was shot several times in the torso by two men who fled in a dark-colored car, a witness told the police. Neighbors awoke to the sound of gunshots, and bullets skittered across the pavement and hit at least one parked car.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez was pronounced dead at the scene. Family members and friends flowed in and out of his apartment yesterday but declined to talk to reporters gathered outside.</p>
        <p>In an earlier shooting, two teenage boys were wounded shortly after midnight yesterday on East Gun Hill Road near the New England Thruway.</p>
        <p>One, a 14-year-old, was shot in the leg, and the other, a 16-year-old, was shot in the buttocks and the shoulder, according to the police. Both were taken to Jacobi Medical Center, where they were in stable condition, the police said.</p>

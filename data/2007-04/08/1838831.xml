        <p>As CD sales nose-dive, the music industry has been relying on cellphone ring tones as one way to lift sagging revenues. Ring tones have been such a big hit that Billboard even has charts for them now. (The No. 1 ring tone from a CD last week was ''This Is Why I'm Hot'' by the rapper Mims.)</p>
        <p>But now the ring-tone market is maturing. Retail sales of ring tones are expected to drop this year by $50 million, to $550 million, compared with 2006, according to Broadcast Music Inc., which handles licensing agreements for the tones.</p>

        <p>As CD sales nose-dive, the music industry has been relying on cellphone ring tones as one way to lift sagging revenues. Ring tones have been such a big hit that Billboard even has charts for them now. (The No. 1 ring tone from a CD last week was ''This Is Why I'm Hot'' by the rapper Mims.)</p>

        <p>The big growth now is in ring-back tones, which are hot in Asia and spreading west. In case you are old and out of it, a ring back is music that the caller hears while waiting for his or her call to be answered (instead of a beep or a b-rrrrrrrrring).</p>
        <p>In its first forecast on ring backs, BMI is estimating that they will bring in approximately $65 million in retail revenue this year.</p>
        <p>Whether ring backs will become as popular as ring tones remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: they are much less intrusive. With a ring back, Mims tells just one person how hot he is. With a ring tone, he lets the whole room know.</p>

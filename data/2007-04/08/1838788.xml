        <p>THE New York International Auto Show is under way at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan. A week ago there was nothing but concrete floor and pillars, but between last Sunday and when the doors opened to the public on Friday, 667 trailers were unloaded, an elaborate ceiling lighting system was lowered and 800,000 square feet of carpeting was laid out.</p>
        <p>About 50 vehicles are making their American or world premieres this week at the show. And while New Yorkers may claim that they have no need for a car in the city, they might want to check out the ''Taxi 07'' exhibition, which commemorates the centennial of the modern taxi in New York. The exhibition includes eight cars and features prototypes for taxis of the future. If that's not enough to grab a New Yorker's attention, Chevrolet is showcasing three concept minicars from South Korea -- perfect for parking in tight city spaces.</p>

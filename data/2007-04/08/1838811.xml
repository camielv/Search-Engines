        <p>At some companies, changes in chief executives' pay roughly corresponded with changes in their shareholders' total return last year. Several exceptions were in favor of shareholders, while other outliers favored C.E.O.'s.</p>
        <p>Entergy  J. Wayne Leonard  $15.5 million  His pay includes $7.8 million in stock, which can be cashed out in only three years.</p>
        <p>General Electric  Jeffrey R. Immelt  $15.2 million  Mr. Immelt's 2006 pay includes a $6.3 million stock award that is subject to cash flow and investor return over 5 years.</p>
        <p>Citigroup  Charles O. Prince III  $24.9 million  Among Wall Street chiefs, the embattled Citigroup boss received the lowest annual pay package.</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch  E. Stanley O'Neal  $46.4 million  A change-in-control at Merrill could land Mr. O'Neal a $251 million exit package.</p>
        <p>Berkshire Hathaway  Warren E. Buffett  $214,250  In 2006, Mr. Buffett received $100,000 in base pay. Of course, he holds $40.7 billion in Berkshire shares.</p>
        <p>Apple  Steven P. Jobs  $1.00  Mr. Jobs received only $1 in total compensation. But his year-end holdings of Apple stock exceeded $414 million.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T  Edward E. Whitacre Jr.  $31.5 million  Mr. Whitacre can also expect about $74 million in deferred pay and $84 million in pension in retirement.</p>
        <p>Occidental Petroleum  Ray R. Irani  $52.1 million  Even with a pay cut, Mr. Irani was second on the 2006 list; he also cashed out $270 million stock option profits.</p>
        <p>Washington Mutual  Kerry K. Killinger  $18.1 million  Mr. Killinger's pay fell by nearly 30% while shareholders enjoyed a 9.3% return in 2006.</p>
        <p>Amgen  Kevin W. Sharer  $18.6 million  Mr. Sharer's pay rose about 11% in 2006. Amgen's stock dropped 13.4% drop last year.</p>
        <p>Texas Instruments  Richard K. Templeton  $12.4 million  In 2006 less than 20% of his pay was tied to concrete performance targets.</p>
        <p>Toll Brothers  Robert I. Toll  $23.4 million  Mr. Toll received a $17.5 million bonus last year, about 2.5 percent of profits, as shares fell 21.7%.</p>
        <p>Motorola  Edward J. Zander  $12.7 million  Mr. Zander's pay in 2006 included $350,999 for personal use of corporate aircraft.</p>
        <p>Goldman Sachs Group  Lloyd C. Blankfein  $54.3 million  Mr. Blankfein was the highest paid chief on Wall Street and off.</p>
        <p>Graph tracks 2006 shareholder total return* and change in chief executive's compensation from previous year for selected companies.</p>
        <p>Off the Charts  A look at some of the outliers shows examples of extreme growth in pay.</p>
        <p>Boston Scientific  Pay Increase: +1,410%</p>
        <p>CSX: +499%</p>
        <p>Synnex: +232%</p>
        <p>Kohl's: +229%</p>
        <p>Seagate Technology: +146%</p>
        <p>Pepco: +106%</p>
        <p>Solectron: +174%</p>
        <p>*For the company's fiscal year</p>

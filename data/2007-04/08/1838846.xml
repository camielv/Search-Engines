        <p>The host of ''Ride With Funkmaster Flex'' on Spike TV, the D.J. was on hand at the New York auto show last week, where he introduced the Ford Expedition Funkmaster Flex Edition, the latest project he has done with Ford. His Navigator, decked out in red and black paint with orange pinstripes, will be sold in limited quantities beginning this fall.</p>
        <p>He said he had met Mr. Mulally, a former Boeing executive, several times since Mr. Mulally took charge at Ford. ''He's very sincere,'' Funkmaster Flex said. ''He's not afraid of a challenge. He knows what's great about his company and what's not great about his company.''</p>
        <p>''Some chief executives don't know what you're talking about,'' he added. But with Mr. Mulally, he said, ''I feel like I can shoot him an e-mail and we can talk.''</p>

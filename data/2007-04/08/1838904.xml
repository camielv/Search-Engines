        <p>The principal suspect in a fatal shooting near Kennedy International Airport was taken into custody without incident yesterday in Richmond, Va., and confessed to the shooting, the Richmond police said.</p>
        <p>The suspect was arrested at the Greyhound bus station in Richmond soon after he got off a bus that had arrived from New York City. The police would not release his name because of his age and identified him only as a ''juvenile suspect.''</p>
        <p>The suspect was taken to police headquarters, where he was interviewed and later confessed, according to a police statement.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the New York Police Department said last night that detectives had flown to Richmond and would give no further updates on the case until the suspect was extradited back to New York.</p>
        <p>He was wanted by the New York police and the Port Authority police, which have jurisdiction over Kennedy Airport, in the fatal shooting of Scott Richards, 34.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richards was shot twice in the head about 5:30 a.m. on Friday in a car on the Van Wyck Expressway as it headed toward Terminal 7 at J.F.K., the New York police said.</p>
        <p>The suspect was in the back seat and the victim was sitting in the front passenger seat of the car, which Mr. Richards's companion was driving. After the shooting, the suspect ordered her to stop at Terminal 7, where he hailed a livery cab, according to the police.</p>
        <p>Distraught, the woman then drove to the house of Mr. Richards's aunt in Queens, with Mr. Richards wounded and bleeding in the seat next to her. She drove there, she told the police, because she did not know where else to go.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richards was declared dead at the scene at 5:51 a.m.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richards had a long criminal record and had served seven years in prison for manslaughter, according to a spokeswoman for the State Department of Correctional Services.</p>
        <p>The police speculated that an argument over drugs prompted the shooting.</p>

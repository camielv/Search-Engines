        <p>Re ''Running for Dollars'' (editorial, April 5):</p>
        <p>What if nobody gave? The problem with the American political system is that it is not controlled by the voters and has not been for many years. Major corporations, the Republican and Democratic National Committees and the media dictate who the nominees will be, and to a large degree, who our next president will be.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Running for Dollars'' (editorial, April 5):</p>
        <p>What if nobody gave? The problem with the American political system is that it is not controlled by the voters and has not been for many years. Major corporations, the Republican and Democratic National Committees and the media dictate who the nominees will be, and to a large degree, who our next president will be.</p>
        <p>The Electoral College system also skews the results, and deprives voters in certain states of the opportunity to see and hear the candidates up close.</p>
        <p>The system needs to be reformed, and I would cast my vote today for any candidate who stated that if nominated he or she would run a presidential campaign on public financing only.</p>
        <p>Henry A. Lowenstein  New York, April 5, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Would the media please stop gasping at the scoreboard and tell me what's happening on the field? Who is giving what to whom, why are they giving and why are they taking? That would help me, and no one is better able to tell me than my daily newspaper.</p>
        <p>Marc Fagan  Folsom, Calif., April 5, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your editorial indicts the ''political industry'' for ''spinning the money before it is spent, ordaining mega-fund-raising as the sine qua non of a credible candidacy.''</p>
        <p>Any reader of The Times will recognize how complicit its own reporting has been with this ''political industry.'' Primary races barely under way are routinely described as if they involved, at best, the two candidates with the most money; other candidates are either relegated to bottom paragraphs or not mentioned at all (for example, see ''Early '08 Fund-Raising Has Clear Blue Tint,'' news analysis, front page, April 5).</p>
        <p>In doing this, the news pages of The Times represent the rule, rather than the exception, to the habits of the mainstream media, which amplify rather than correct the spin of the ''political industry'' that they report on.</p>
        <p>Eric Idsvoog  Cambridge, Mass., April 5, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The fund-raising numbers from Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are encouraging. I am not talking about the sheer amounts of money that they raised, but rather the number of small donors, particularly in the case of Senator Obama. It is great that new people are getting involved in the political process.</p>
        <p>Let's hope that we see continued increased involvement in this 2008 presidential race.</p>
        <p>Steven M. Clayton  Ocean, N.J., April 5, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is a Democratic committeeman in Monmouth County.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am pretty well disgusted already with the presidential campaign, both for the amount of money filling the coffers and for the early start of political posturing and bickering.</p>
        <p>I am prepared to vote for the candidate who jumps in at the last minute, without a truckload of money and with the intent to offer the voter a full résumé the fewest number of times possible.</p>
        <p>Amy Adler  Toledo, Ohio, April 5, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Here's a solution to the problem of money in political campaigns: a bill that in each election cycle would finance 10 candidates for president and 10 for each open seat in the House and Senate.</p>
        <p>The prerequisite would be a reasonable number of signatures on a petition.</p>
        <p>If incumbents automatically got these funds, they could do their jobs rather than waste hundreds of hours raising money.</p>
        <p>Andrew Donson  Northampton, Mass., April 5, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mitt Romney's $20 million war chest is widely used to indicate the wide support he enjoys.</p>
        <p>It's too bad that the news media sometimes pay less attention to the amount a candidate contributes to his own campaign, which is included in the total reported.</p>
        <p>And very little mention is made of the fact that the Romney campaign pays student fund-raisers 10 percent of the funds they raise after the first $1,000.</p>
        <p>Surely this distorts the reality about the extent of ''grass roots'' support the candidate enjoys.</p>
        <p>Sylva Apelian  New York, April 5, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Full public financing of elections is the only way to clean up the money-in-politics mess. Changing private contribution limits is mere window-dressing.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the Supreme Court equates money with speech -- what wisdom!</p>
        <p>Still, voluntary full public campaign financing laws have already passed in some states, including Arizona and Maine.</p>
        <p>Voters can push for national laws in Washington. The Fair Elections Now Act, proposed by Senators Richard J. Durbin and Arlen Specter, would make a good start by changing the way senatorial campaigns are financed.</p>

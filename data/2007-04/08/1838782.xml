        <p>ON a stuffy August day in 2004, for a brief time, Roosevelt Island was cut off from the city that surrounds it.</p>
        <p>All the means of access to the sliver-shaped island were out of service for about an hour that day, Aug. 12. The tram was down for a periodic tune-up. The Roosevelt Island Bridge, which lifts to allow boat traffic to pass through, was stuck in the open position. Electrical problems temporarily halted service on the F train.</p>
        <p>''If someone had a heart attack or a fire, there would have been no way to get an ambulance onto the island,'' said Matthew Katz, president of the Roosevelt Island Residents Association.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, there were no disasters, but Mr. Katz has worried about emergency planning ever since. His solution: additional access routes to serve the island's 12,000 residents.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the transportation committee of Manhattan Community Board 8 will consider a request from Mr. Katz and his association to allow island residents direct access to the Queensboro Bridge via staircase or elevator.</p>
        <p>According to David Liston, the board's chairman, Mr. Katz's proposal was important enough to be placed on the group's agenda, although he has no idea what it will recommend. ''He's raised some safety concerns,'' Mr. Liston said. ''One of the challenges of living there is the sense people sometimes have that they are separated from the city at large in access to services.''</p>
        <p>But Kay Sarlin, a spokeswoman for the city Department of Transportation, raised doubts about a passageway that would have to be nearly 135 feet high.</p>
        <p>''It's not feasible,'' she said. ''They'd have to remove a lane of traffic to put in an elevator.''</p>
        <p>With an average of about 180,000 vehicle crossings a day, the Queensboro is one of the city's busiest bridges, and according to Ms. Sarlin, eliminating a lane for an elevator would hamper traffic. A stairway could not be installed because people with disabilities could not use it, she added, noting that such a change would also cause security problems. Further, she said, since the facade of the bridge has landmark status, altering it would present a problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Katz, a leader of the successful push for the island's tramway to accept MetroCards, expressed optimism nevertheless. From 1930 to 1955, when the island was known as Welfare Island, the only auto access was via an elevator from the Queensboro Bridge to the island.</p>
        <p>''You never know what's going to happen,'' Mr. Katz said. ''You never know.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 15, 2007, Sunday  An article last Sunday about Roosevelt Island residents' wish for additional access to the Queensboro Bridge misstated the years during which the island's only auto access was via an elevator from the bridge. The elevator was in use from 1916 to 1956 -- not 1930 to 1955.</p>

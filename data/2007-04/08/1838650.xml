        <p>David Reney letter comments on March 25 article on Adam Greenberg, baseball player hit by ball on his first major league at-bat</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>It is a cruel irony that Adam Greenberg, whose achievements owed little to luck and everything to hard work, talent and determination, should have his career brutally thwarted, if not yet quite ended, by the ill luck of one errant pitch during his first at-bat as a major leaguer. One applauded Barry Bearak's (March 25) sensitive and rightfully compassionate portrait of this valiant young man until the final sentence, which, though ostensibly cheering, unnecessarily reminds us that everything can indeed change ''in the blink of an eye.''</p>

      <dateline>ABOARD THE TRAIN FROM DAKAR, SENEGAL, TO BAMAKO, MALI, FEB. 7, 2007</dateline>

        <p>Julia Otis, 25, of La Jolla, Calif.: ''I was in Dakar for about seven months on an internship with Human Rights Watch, then left to take this crazy loop through West Africa. The train ride was the beginning. It was like a ghost train. It went about five kilometers an hour and would stop in every frontier town with a population of five and some lady selling bananas. In the photo, I was trying to get a breath of fresh air and a little space from my seatmate, whom we had dubbed Madame Crazy. She had some strange habits, including scratching flakes of skin off her feet and brushing them onto me. We had a very intimate time together, Madame Crazy and I, sleeping curled up next to each other like kittens. Despite the filth and the heat, it was a great way to start off the trip: 48 hours with absolutely nothing to do but think about what I was embarking on and stare out the window watching the baobab trees go by.''</p>

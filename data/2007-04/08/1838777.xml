        <p>Arborcide</p>
        <p>Q. Now that spring is here, I'm trying to impress on my sons the evils of vandalizing trees. Could you tell me the penalty for cutting trees illegally in the city?</p>
        <p>A. It's heavy. The city code says that anyone illegally cutting down trees on public property can be fined up to $15,000 and jailed for up to a year. Violators may also face an additional penalty of up to $10,000 by the Environmental Control Board, plus civil fines.</p>

        <p>Q. Now that spring is here, I'm trying to impress on my sons the evils of vandalizing trees. Could you tell me the penalty for cutting trees illegally in the city?</p>
        <p>A. It's heavy. The city code says that anyone illegally cutting down trees on public property can be fined up to $15,000 and jailed for up to a year. Violators may also face an additional penalty of up to $10,000 by the Environmental Control Board, plus civil fines.</p>
        <p>Public trees in New York are under the protection of the parks commissioner. That includes trees in places like sidewalks and median strips, not just official parks. ''We have about 2 million trees within our nearly 29,000 acres, and about 600,000 more trees on the sidewalks,'' said Warner Johnston, a spokesman for the Parks Department.</p>
        <p>The Fair Lives On</p>
        <p>Q. Do any buildings survive from the 1939-40 New York World's Fair?</p>
        <p>A. We know of five buildings. One is obvious, one is a subway ride away from the original site, and to see another, you'll need to make a long trip.</p>
        <p>The obvious one is the New York City Building in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Used as the city's pavilion for both the 1939 and 1964 fairs, the hall also served as a roller rink, as a skating rink and as the first site of the United Nations General Assembly, from 1946 to 1950. The building's north side now houses the Queens Museum of Art. There is still a skating rink in the New York City Building. But when the new Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Pool and Rink opens this fall, the Queens Museum will take over the area where the rink is as well.</p>
        <p>The 1939 boathouse survives on the shore of Meadow Lake, in the park, and is being renovated. The garage for the Parks Department's Olmsted Center, headquarters of the capital projects division, also dates from the 1939 fair.</p>
        <p>The Parachute Jump, on Riegelmann Boardwalk at West 16th Street in Coney Island, was originally built for the 1939 fair. In 1940 it was rebuilt in Steeplechase Park, where it operated for 28 years. Although it has long been closed, its tapering steel structure with its radiating crown was named a city landmark in 1989.</p>
        <p>To see the other surviving building, you will have to travel to the campus of Virginia Union University in Richmond. After World War II broke out, the Belgian Pavilion could not be returned to Belgium on the World's Fair's closing in 1940. After choosing the university as its beneficiary, the Belgian government moved the pavilion to Richmond and reconstructed it in 1941-42 as the Belgium Friendship Building. The university's library was there until 1997. The building houses a Virginia Union gymnasium as well as its performing arts theater, classrooms and offices.</p>
        <p>The Wet Underground</p>
        <p>Q. Is there an underground brook in the West Fourth Street subway station? I'm referring to the north end of the Sixth Avenue local platform. At the bottom of the station wall is a niche from which water pulses as if there were waves on the other side. What's its source?</p>
        <p>A. Let's clear up one suspicion: It's not Minetta Brook, which once flowed nearby and may still flow underground in parts of Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>Charles Seaton, a spokesman for New York City Transit, said the water is just ground water, a common occurrence, and does not pose a threat to the subway system. ''Even on a day when it doesn't rain we pump out 13 million gallons of water from the subway system,'' he said.</p>

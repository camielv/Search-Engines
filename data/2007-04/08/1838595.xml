        <p>FOULKE--William G. 94, on March 30th, 2007, at home in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, PA. Retired Chairman of Provident National Bank (a predecessor to PNC Bank); civic leader in Philadelphia. He established Provident as a leading provider of trust services, thus laying the groundwork for PNC's investment management business. Upon retirement from Provident he became Chairman of Pardee Resources Company, a family enterprise founded by his grandfather. A graduate of St. Paul's School, Concord, NH and Princeton University, he was known for his foresightedness, gentle humor and kindness. At the height of the energy crisis of the 1970s, he commuted by train from Chestnut Hill to conserve energy but steadfastly refused to fire the driver provided by the bank to take him to various meetings saying that the man had a wife and children to support and that the crisis would not last forever. In 1934, he captained the Princeton tennis and squash teams and won the squash intercollegiate championship. Many years later, he became a national senior doubles court tennis champion. He was an avid fly fisherman and boating enthusiast. He had a marvelous 67 year marriage to the former Louisa Lawrence Wood, who predeceased him in 2001. Ten years previously, they both broke their necks in a car accident but miraculously survived without spinal column injury. He always said he was a lucky man. We were lucky to know him. He is survived by three married children, Louisa and Bill Newlin, of Washington, D.C., Walter and Wendy Foulke of Philadelphia, PA, and Bill and Wendy Foulke of Bedford, NY, and by eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at St. Thomas' Church, Whitemarsh, PA at noon on Friday, April 20th. In lieu of flowers, contributions will be gratefully received by St. Thomas' Church, Whitemarsh, PA; or St. Paul's School, Concord, NH; or College of the Atlantic, Bar Harbor, ME.</p>

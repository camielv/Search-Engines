        <p>A 25-year-old woman who went to a Brooklyn hospital on Friday night suffering from abdominal pain and excessive bleeding was arrested yesterday in the death of her newborn daughter, who was later found in a garbage bag on the back porch of the woman's family home, the police said.</p>
        <p>The woman, Laura Sergio, was charged with murder last night, while her two sisters, Andria Sergio, 27, and Cara Sergio, 29, were charged, respectively, with improper disposal of a human body and obstructing the police investigation.</p>
        <p>About 9:45 p.m. on Friday, according to the police, an ambulance was called to the Tudor-style house of the women's parents, Dominick and Lena Sergio, on Colonial Road in Bay Ridge.</p>
        <p>Laura Sergio had passed out on the bathroom floor, the police said, and was taken to Lutheran Medical Center, where hospital workers surmised that she had recently given birth.</p>
        <p>When they asked Ms. Sergio where the baby was, she was evasive, the police said. The hospital called the police shortly before 3 a.m. yesterday, and officers went to the Sergio family's home.</p>
        <p>The police said they found two garbage bags on the back porch. One was filled with bloodied rags and towels, and the other contained a baby girl, unresponsive and wrapped in a towel, the police said. The infant was also taken to Lutheran Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead.</p>
        <p>Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner's office, said the baby had been carried to full term, was born alive, and died of asphyxiation and hypothermia.</p>
        <p>The discovery dismayed neighbors, who said trouble was rare along their street. Many said they were unaware that Laura Sergio had been pregnant.</p>
        <p>''You don't expect anybody, especially in this neighborhood, to do anything of that sort,'' said Christie Marrone, 20, who said she lived nearby and knew the Sergios.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marrone said that the Sergios often held backyard barbecues, and that Lena Sergio was notoriously strict.</p>
        <p>Another neighbor, Virginia Michaels, 51, said she sometimes heard Lena Sergio yelling at her daughters, though other neighbors insisted they had seen no signs of family conflict.</p>
        <p>Ms. Michaels said that Mr. Sergio was a public school teacher and that his wife worked as a secretary at Long Island University.</p>

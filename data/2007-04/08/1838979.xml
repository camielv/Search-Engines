        <p>Re ''As Cheerleaders Soar Higher, So Do the Risks,'' March 31: I am 16 years old and a former cheerleader. I have been a cheerleading coach for the past two years. I was glad to see the article because not many people understand how dangerous cheerleading is, and most people don't even consider it a sport.</p>

        <p>Life-threatening accidents should never happen. The Sacramento City College team was trying a new stunt when an airborne cheerleader, or flier, fell to the floor after one of the boys responsible for catching her lost his balance.</p>
        <p>Losing your balance is understandable, but there should have been more teammates there to protect her. Whenever our team tries a new maneuver, the cheerleaders form a ''safety circle'' around the stunt group; if someone fails to catch the flier, there are many more to catch her. The coach should have made sure that the safety of the cheerleaders came first.</p>

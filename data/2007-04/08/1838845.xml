        <p>MAKING WAVES</p>
        <p>The News -- The American swimmer Michael Phelps broke five world records at the world swimming championships in Melbourne. Australia, and tied Mark Spitz, the 1972 Olympic champion, as the only man to win seven gold medals in a major meet.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Swimming all four strokes, Phelps, winner of six gold medals at the 2004 Olympics, was unstoppable. As The New York Times's Christopher Clarey put it: ''In a sport in which the numbers after the decimal point usually make the difference between first place and second, Phelps overwhelmed the paradigm at age 21, pulverizing records by a second or two.'' Mark Schubert, the United States coach, called it ''the greatest performance of all time.''</p>
        <p>BEING CAREFUL</p>
        <p>The News -- New York City said that it gave away five million new subway-themed condoms in a month, demolishing the previous record of 2.5 million in July 2005.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Could it be that spring is in the air? That's about two condoms for every man living in the city. Packaged in wrappers with lettering mimicking the logos of the city's subway lines, the condoms are distributed free to doctors, businesses, bars, restaurants and other groups. The release of the city-branded condoms on Valentine's Day coincided with the launch of a Web site -- www.nyccondom.org -- with information on where they are available. The site received nearly 35,000 visits in its first month, Feb. 14 to March 14.</p>
        <p>FLYING HIGH</p>
        <p>The News -- Boeing announced that it had sold more than 500 of its fuel-efficient 787 passenger jets since the first plane was ordered in April 2004, making it the fastest-selling commercial airplane in history.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The company has orders from 43 customers for 514 of the jets, though the first one is not scheduled for delivery for more than a year. The plane is designed to burn 20 percent less fuel than comparable airplanes by using more lightweight composites. The biggest of the models can carry up to 330 passengers and travel 3,500 miles without refueling. The Boeing 737 NG set the old record for the fastest-selling plane, with 473 orders before the first was rolled out in December 1996.</p>
        <p>RAISING CASH</p>
        <p>The News -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination said it had raised $26 million in the first three months of this year, about three times as much as the previous record at this stage of the race.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The money race is off to a furious start. Senator Barack Obama raised $25 million over the same period; former Senator John Edwards, $14 million. The first-quarter results were seen as an important test of strength. For the first time since public financing for presidential races was adopted in 1974, after Watergate, the top candidates plan to reject public money -- and the spending limits that come with it -- so they can raise as much as they can.</p>
        <p>RIDING THE RAILS</p>
        <p>The News -- France's bullet train, the black-and-chrome TGV, set a record for conventional rail trains by reaching a speed of 357.2 miles per hour.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The record exceeded by 37 m.p.h. the previous mark, set in 1990, also by a French train. Credit the performance enhancements. The train normally runs at about 186 miles per hour. But engineers outfitted it with a 25,000-horsepower engine, increased the electrical power from overhead cables, added larger wheels to cover more ground with each rotation and treated the tracks so the wheels could make perfect contact. For all that, it still missed the overall record -- 361 m.p.h., set by Japan's magnetically levitated train in 2003.</p>

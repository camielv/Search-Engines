        <p>For the 50th anniversary of the San Francisco International Film Festival (fest07.sffs.org), taking place from April 26 to May 10, the city itself will play a more prominent role than usual. In between screenings of bay area documentaries like ''Fog City Mavericks'' (2007), which explores the history of filmmaking in San Francisco, and ''Audience of One'' (2007), which follows a local Pentecostal minister as he directs a sci-fi biblical epic, participants can visit the shooting locations of classic San Francisco movies, like Fort Point. Located under the Golden Gate Bridge, the fort provided the jumping off point (literally) for Kim Novak in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 thriller ''Vertigo,'' before Jimmy Stewart fished her out (below). For a list of San Francisco sites made famous by ''Vertigo,'' ''Dirty Harry,'' ''The Maltese Falcon'' and other classic movies, visit www.sffs.org/filmtours/selfguided.html.  Nine Marriott resorts in the Caribbean and Mexico, including Grand Cayman Marriott Beach Resort and CasaMagna Marriott Cancun Resort, are offering the 1040 Family Travel package, which encourages parents to use their tax refunds for a sunny family vacation. The package, for which there is a five-night minimum, includes nightly rates starting at $154 (based on double occupancy, with children 12 and under staying for free), breakfast, an in-room family pizza party, and turndown service with milk and cookies. Reservations must be made prior to May 31 for travel between June 1 and Aug. 31/ (www.paradisebymarriott.com/taxrefund). ... Starting May 1, Air France will offer a new morning flight from New York's John F. Kennedy airport to the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. Flights leave at 7:50 a.m., arriving in Paris at 9 p.m. the same day, while the return flight leaves Paris at 8:45 p.m. and arrives at 11:00 p.m. (www.airfrance.com/us). ... Royal Caribbean International is starting a new wellness-oriented program this month on its newest ship, Liberty of the Seas. Fitness classes and spa treatments will focus on finding one's balance and will include Tai Chi, meditation, massage and acupuncture. The program also includes lectures on health issues, a virtual personal trainer kiosk that assists guests in creating fitness routines, healthy menu options and shore excursions that include biking, kayaking, snorkeling and zip-lining (www.royalcaribbean.com). ... The Association of Southeast Asian Nations has a new Web Site, www.cruiseasean.com, which introduces its ten members, including Cambodia and Thailand, to the cruise industry and to travelers new to the region. Port and tourism information for each member country is available.</p>

        <p>Editorial supports Connecticut Gov M Jodi Rell's proposal for state property tax cap</p>

        <p>Less than two weeks ago, Gov. M. Jodi Rell became the first Connecticut governor in decades to propose a state law to cap property tax increases.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately, in what is beginning to be a pattern here, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate dismissed the move. The House speaker, James Amann, called it ''mumbo jumbo.'' The Senate president pro tempore, Donald Williams, called it ''a gimmick.''</p>
        <p>It is neither of these things. Connecticut residents, who suffer under the second-highest property taxes in the country, deserve more consideration on this issue than they have received from the majority Democrats.</p>
        <p>The governor's idea got predictable criticism for not being proposed sooner. But she offered this latest plan in reaction to opponents who said that her February proposal to spend millions more on education was not balanced by curbs on the rise in property taxes.</p>
        <p>People were afraid, and rightly so, that towns would take additional state money while continuing to raise property taxes. For residents of a state whose property taxes are second only to New Jersey's, this was unacceptable. Because the tax cap would be coupled with big increases in state aid for education, limiting the rise of local taxes should not adversely affect school districts.</p>
        <p>Every cap has exceptions, and Ms. Rell's has four. A town budget could increase more than 3 percent if there's an emergency; if the tax roll grew more than 1.5 percent; if the state did not keep its promise to finance education at specified levels and if the town's governing body and residents voted to override the cap. This last option is not unheard of; many Massachusetts towns have voted to override their state-mandated cap of 2.5 percent.</p>
        <p>The cap could potentially limit arbitration awards. When negotiations between unions and towns deadlock, state arbitrators decide on the level of raises for teachers, police officers and firefighters. This proposal would force arbitrators to take into account the ability of a municipality to stay within the 3 percent cap before deciding the awards. But given the additional state money for education, this clause should not hurt the school budgets.</p>
        <p>Finally, there are those who protest that such a cap would handcuff town officials and throw the budget process into chaos. But voters already roil the budget process. Many Connecticut municipalities pass their budgets at town meetings, and it is not unusual to see the ornery electorate vote against budgets several times.</p>
        <p>More than half the states impose limits on the rise of property taxes. New Jersey just voted for one, and Massachusetts has had one for 27 years. There is no reason that Connecticut should not be among them.</p>

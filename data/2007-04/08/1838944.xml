        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It's not surprising that Howard Blum sees national implications in the inconveniences that he is forced to suffer. He is, after all, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair who lives in Connecticut and feels compelled to tell us, twice, that he wears a cashmere topcoat.</p>
        <p>But I am surprised that The Times's editors thought ''Prisoner of Park Avenue'' (Op-Ed, April 1) worth publishing (in the New Jersey section, of all places). How can you believe that a computer foul-up that resulted in his arrest on unpaid traffic tickets has anything to do with the national debate about how tough to be on crime?</p>
        <p>George Thomas  Warren</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officers have the right, for good cause, to temporarily deprive citizens of their freedom through arrest. In police academies, fledgling officers learn that they have great discretion to do so. They also learn that they have a duty to protect the liberties of citizens.</p>
        <p>Howard Blum may have left some critical detail out of his version of the facts. Barring that possibility, the officers treated Mr. Blum abusively. His three hits from the police database were not crimes. They were non-criminal offenses, not capable of meriting jail time. Yet the officers on the scene -- and their supervisors -- decided to process the routine traffic stop like a criminal act.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement cannot do its job successfully without the support of the public. This incident -- one of the thousands of arrests that will be dismissed by judges this year -- eats away at much-needed support for law enforcement.</p>
        <p>Robert McCrie  New York</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of law, police science and criminal justice administration at John Jay College.</p>

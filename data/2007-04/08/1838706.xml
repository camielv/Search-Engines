        <p>Editorial supports changes made by New York State Legislature to school funding formula; maintains process of adjusting unjust system is far from over</p>

        <p>The New York State Legislature passed a practically on-time budget last week with a lot in it to be happy about. That good news was obscured almost immediately by rounds of loudly self-serving analysis by lawmakers over the way the budget distributes education aid to the New York suburbs. Neither the complaining (in Westchester) nor the crowing (on Long Island) was entirely appropriate.</p>
        <p>It's complicated, but let's discuss. One of Gov. Eliot Spitzer's prime directives on taking office was to overhaul New York's perverse system of doling out school aid. It is called a ''formula,'' a label meant to give the appearance of mathematical objectivity to what has been a yearly exercise in political scheming and muscle-flexing.</p>

        <p>The New York State Legislature passed a practically on-time budget last week with a lot in it to be happy about. That good news was obscured almost immediately by rounds of loudly self-serving analysis by lawmakers over the way the budget distributes education aid to the New York suburbs. Neither the complaining (in Westchester) nor the crowing (on Long Island) was entirely appropriate.</p>
        <p>It's complicated, but let's discuss. One of Gov. Eliot Spitzer's prime directives on taking office was to overhaul New York's perverse system of doling out school aid. It is called a ''formula,'' a label meant to give the appearance of mathematical objectivity to what has been a yearly exercise in political scheming and muscle-flexing.</p>
        <p>That scheming has long sent disproportionate amounts of aid to districts represented by powerful Republican Senators (i.e., Long Island) while robbing places like New York City of billions of dollars. This year Mr. Spitzer tried to fix the so-called ''foundation formula'' to take out the politics and to direct more money to the districts that need it.</p>
        <p>The outcome wasn't perfect. In the end, Mr. Spitzer had to add about $100 million in new school aid, and send a fat chunk of it to Long Island, so Republicans there would not sabotage budget negotiations. Because of this deal, sealed behind closed doors, Long Island walked away with about as much education money as it had in the past. Westchester's share of the new aid was only about $1.2 million, which led lawmakers there to howl about being unfairly singled out by ''destructive'' tactics made possible by incomprehensible calculations buried deep in the document. Long Island lawmakers, meanwhile, were only too happy to take credit for bagging about $70 million of the $100 million, which was earmarked for high-tax districts like theirs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer's response to the kibitzing is to point to the overall fairness of the new foundation formula, which increased aid by 9.4 percent in Westchester, 8.6 percent in Suffolk and 13.4 percent in Nassau. The high-tax adjustment did benefit Long Island, but that windfall was offset by a sharp reduction elsewhere: The property-tax relief Long Island gets through the School Tax Relief program, or STAR, was cut by about $50 million. Westchester, meanwhile, had its own ameliorating budget tweak: an extra $8.5 million for perennially strapped Yonkers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer and the Legislature have clearly not removed all the fiddling from the budget process. You can be sure that Westchester lawmakers will fight fiercely to adjust things to their benefit, as they have every right to do. But the bottom line for this year: Westchester made out O.K. Long Island did better than O.K. The New York City schools did well, and will do better in coming years, and so the rigged process that unfairly brought wheelbarrows of cash to Long Island over the years will not be sustainable. The process of adjusting an unjust system is far from over. But at least it has begun.</p>

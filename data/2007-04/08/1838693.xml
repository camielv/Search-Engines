        <p>Heading east on the Post Road in Fairfield, it is hard to miss the glowing red sign for La Salsa Fresh Mexican Grill, high up on an ecru-colored building. What is easier to overlook is that this diminutive place offers one of the better bargains around. And while the food comes off the grill with great rapidity, the quality of its ingredients sets it leagues above Taco Bell.</p>
        <p>Tacos, served by the pair, will set you back $4.90 for charbroiled chicken, or $5.99 if filled with grilled shrimp. The best deal among an octet of flour tortilla-wrapped burritos is a basic bean and cheese ($3.80), but the Vera Cruz, while pricier ($6.19), has more going for it, stuffed with mahi-mahi, rice, avocado, cabbage, capers, olives and peppers. There are also chicken enchiladas and tamales, and a number of what are called ''favorites'' on the menu, including an oversize stuffed fajita quesadilla ($6.95 for chicken, 80 cents more for beef) and a trio of salads.</p>

        <p>Satisfying as these and many other entrees are, it is the salsa bar that elevates the food at this California-based chain to a higher level. Seven sauces, made daily, are available to goose up your order. The more notable are salsa verde, with roasted tomatillos and a snap of cumin; mango, with onion and pepper; and a fiery habanero. Additional condiments include chopped jalape√±os, fresh cilantro, lime wedges and lightly marinated carrot discs.</p>
        <p>Orders may be phoned in, or placed at the stainless steel counter and picked up when your number is called. While the compact seating area leads many people to take their food out, a painted Guerreran plate and some cut-tin coyotes on the pale yellow walls endow the place with an agreeable flavor of Mexico.</p>
        <p>La Salsa Fresh Mexican Grill, 580 Post Road, Fairfield; (203) 256-8800 or www.lasalsa.com. Open Sunday to Thursday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.</p>

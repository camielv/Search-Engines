        <p>While most of the spring exhibitions are already in full swing, the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM is gearing up for a series of shows beginning Saturday and running throughout the summer. Occupying large portions of the Guggenheim's Frank Lloyd Wright building, they will include everything from paintings and sculptures to video and site-specific installations.</p>
        <p>Using only works from the museum's permanent collection, curators have organized a series of four sequential shows under the overall title ''THE SHAPES OF SPACE.'' All the art will explore the meaning of space as an abstract concept.</p>
        <p>Rather than tackle the subject chronologically, each exhibition will combine works from different periods, from the early 20th century to the present. Much of the art will be organized by theme, illustrating the artistic meaning of space in all its permutations.</p>
        <p>Several large-scale contemporary works recently acquired by the Guggenheim will form the core of the exhibition. On the ground floor, visible from the outside of the building at night, will be Alyson Shotz's ''Shape of Space,'' a 2004 work from which the show is derived. It is a giant, shimmering wall of more than 18,000 ovals of hand-cut plastic that captures and refracts light.</p>
        <p>Another monumental work in the show is Pipilotti Rist's ''Himalaya's Sister's Living Room,'' from 2000, which recreates a dimly lighted, cluttered domestic interior meant to explore the thoughts and memories contained within a household space.</p>
        <p>Other artists on view are Piet Mondrian, Larry Bell, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Sarah Morris and Piotr Uklanski. Through Sept. 5, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org.</p>
        <p>''The Shapes of Space,'' coincides with another exhibition opening Saturday at the Guggenheim, this one documenting the continuing restoration of the museum's Frank Lloyd Wright building.</p>
        <p>''FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT'S GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: RESTORING A MASTERPIECE,'' on view through July 8, will include photographs, drawings and computer-generated images as well as interviews with the team involved in the restoration, repair and conservation. Every part of the project will be explored, from restoring the exterior of the building to reinforcing the upper ramp walls and replacing the windows.</p>

        <p>A few hedges and some gravel will soon turn an empty lot next to a 7-Eleven in the Village of Southampton into a site where day laborers can wait for work.</p>
        <p>''It's not a designated hiring site,'' said Mayor Mark Epley, who announced the plan on March 30. ''We're not changing the use of this lot, but trying to get it better organized and make it safer when trucks pull over to hire the workers.''</p>

        <p>A few hedges and some gravel will soon turn an empty lot next to a 7-Eleven in the Village of Southampton into a site where day laborers can wait for work.</p>
        <p>''It's not a designated hiring site,'' said Mayor Mark Epley, who announced the plan on March 30. ''We're not changing the use of this lot, but trying to get it better organized and make it safer when trucks pull over to hire the workers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Epley said that in recent years 40 to 100 men had congregated on the lot every morning and had recently begun moving into nearby residential areas and toward the village center to wait for work.</p>
        <p>The village plans to enact legislation in about six weeks that will make it illegal to solicit employment in a public right of way or a commercial parking lot. That would not affect the lot next to the 7-Eleven.</p>
        <p>''This is not a solution,'' Mr. Epley said, ''but the result of severe failure of the federal government on immigration policy. Local governments have each had to deal with this problem in its own way. It's a very sensitive issue, and no matter what you do, people will criticize it.''</p>
        <p>On Long Island there are three hiring sites for day workers -- in Glen Cove, Freeport and Huntington Station. A donated building, called the Shape-up Center, on Sea Cliff Avenue in Glen Cove is the only indoor meeting place.</p>
        <p>Mayor Ralph V. Suozzi of Glen Cove said the center was a cooperative effort between the city and La Fuerza Unida, an outreach organization, and provides a building for day workers to wait in for contractors. Those who are not hired can stay at the center to learn English or computer skills, he said.</p>
        <p>''We've tried to come up with a plan that would not ignore the situation but would keep day workers from congregating in our neighborhoods and in front of the local delis,'' Mr. Suozzi said.</p>

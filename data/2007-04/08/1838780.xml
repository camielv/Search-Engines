        <p>As a light rain coated the dugouts of Shea Stadium on Wednesday evening, an 18-year-old from Manalapan, N.J., named Sky Dobbs stood at a microphone facing the field. She was wearing a black New York Mets ski jacket, and her curly brown hair was whipped by the wind.</p>
        <p>After a few seconds, she began belting out the national anthem, extending the word ''free'' in the song's climax for maximum effect.</p>

        <p>Members of the public recently auditioned for a chance to sing the national anthem at Shea Stadium.</p>

        <p>As a light rain coated the dugouts of Shea Stadium on Wednesday evening, an 18-year-old from Manalapan, N.J., named Sky Dobbs stood at a microphone facing the field. She was wearing a black New York Mets ski jacket, and her curly brown hair was whipped by the wind.</p>
        <p>After a few seconds, she began belting out the national anthem, extending the word ''free'' in the song's climax for maximum effect.</p>
        <p>''She came out singing the anthem,'' said Ms. Dobbs's mother, Wendy. She was referring, presumably, to her daughter's birth.</p>
        <p>Yet by the end of the song, there were few claps and a distinct lack of clanging from the stadium's peripatetic Cowbell Man. Every one of the 57,333 seats in the house was empty. The Mets were away in St. Louis, and attendance in Flushing was limited to those crammed into a concrete-block waiting room in the bowels of the stadium.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dobbs was one of the final members of the public to audition for a chance to sing the national anthem this season at Shea, and nerves were understandably on edge.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of like bronchitis,'' said Keith Maguire, a 30-year-old singer and songwriter from Suffolk County, describing the condition that he thought might prevent him from doing as well as he hoped with a notoriously difficult song, especially when performed on a public address system with a 1.4-second delay.</p>
        <p>''I'm a tenor,'' he added as he sucked on a cough drop. ''I could probably sing it up to the key of C, but I'm not going to today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maguire, Ms. Dobbs and 26 others had been selected from a group of 150 (hundreds more lined up, but the time available at the team's recording studio ran out) who had come to an open audition in Midtown on March 28 seeking the chance to be one of five chosen to perform the anthem solo during a regular-season game. The privilege, offered this year for the first time, comes with perks like four box seats per singer and a team jersey.</p>
        <p>''Shea obviously has two years left as the home of the Mets,'' said David Howard, the team's executive vice president for business operations. ''We think many of our fans have often fantasized about being on that field either as a player or as a singer of the anthem.''</p>
        <p>Contestants included some who had already tried out for ''American Idol'' (but didn't make it very far) and a few who had sung the anthem at other sports events but in locations nowhere as big as Shea.</p>
        <p>Two quartets competed: an a cappella ensemble called the Newyorkettes, comprising four young women wearing 1940s-style wigs and American flag bandannas, and a group of ninth-grade girls from Long Island who called themselves Artistry, one of whose members blew into a pitch pipe before the song began.</p>
        <p>''We do musical theater,'' said Victoria Ferrera, one of the ninth graders. ''We've all had leads.''</p>
        <p>Also waiting to perform this day was Nelini Stamp, a 19-year-old from West Brighton, Staten Island, who works as a cashier at the local Macy's and who had been first in line, at 3:45 a.m., for the 11 a.m. audition in March.</p>
        <p>''I probably sang this song like 30 times in the last two days,'' said Ms. Stamp, who was carrying a water bottle in the hope that hydration would keep her voice clear.</p>
        <p>After being led outside, Ms. Stamp placed her purse and her complimentary Pedro Mart√≠nez T-shirt on a nearby Carvel ice cream cart and approached the mike. The bravura performance that followed echoed into the outfield.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stamp, the Newyorkettes, Mr. Maguire and Ms. Dobbs were not among the five winners whose names were announced Thursday. But the Long Island girl group was among those chosen, and Artistry will take its harmony, along with its pitch pipe, out to Shea one day this summer.</p>

        <p>THE flameout of the radio host Don Imus dominated the discourse this week, but there was other intrigue, including what Dow Chemical said were unauthorized merger talks held by two of its officials and the continuing investigation into the practices of student loan companies.</p>
        <p>Vonage Holdings, the Internet telephone company, announced that Jeffrey A. Citron had returned temporarily to run the company he founded seven years ago. Michael F. Snyder, chief executive since January 2006, also resigned his board seat, amid growing concern that Vonage's battle with Verizon was starting to take a toll.</p>
        <p>The company also plans to lay off 10 percent of its 1,800 workers and cut costs by $140 million this year in a move to reach profitability. Vonage's first-quarter revenue was about $195 million, missing analysts' forecasts.</p>
        <p>A federal court has ruled that Vonage violated three patents owned by Verizon. Vonage is appealing that decision, and has received a temporary stay allowing it to continue acquiring subscribers.</p>
        <p>The case is far from over: On April 24, an appeals court will decide if Vonage can continue to attract customers while it appeals; if not, the company may find itself in deeper trouble.</p>

        <p>Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China wrapped up a three-day visit to Japan, saying that the two nations had ''reached broad consensus'' on how to move their relations forward but still needed time to resolve their many differences. Mr. Wen spent his last day trying to show the softer side of China's leadership to Japanese who have grown anxious in recent years of China's economic rise and growing military strength. Mr. Wen met farmers and played baseball with students at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto.</p>

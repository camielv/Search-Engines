      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial contends that it is not surprising that White House is having tough time finding someone to oversee faltering Iraq and Afghanistan war; holds that if White House manages to get someone to take on task, his or her most important job will be telling Pres Bush truth: there is no longer any chance of winning in Iraq, so let's figure out how to get out without leaving total chaos behind</p>

        <p>We have long suspected that there is no one in charge of the Iraq war. How else can you explain four years of multifront failures, including President Bush's most recent plan to order even more American troops to risk their lives there without demanding any political sacrifice or even compromise from Iraq's leaders? So we were not surprised to hear that White House officials are looking for someone to oversee both Iraq and the faltering Afghanistan war-- and not surprised that they were having a tough time filling the job.</p>
        <p>National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley told The Times he'd decided that ''what we need is someone with a lot of stature within the government who can make things happen.'' He said that top official would have the authority to ''call any cabinet secretary and get problems resolved, fast.''</p>

How else can you explain four years of multifront failures, including President Bush's most recent plan to order even more American troops to risk their lives there without demanding any political sacrifice or even compromise from Iraq's leaders? So we were not surprised to hear that White House officials are looking for someone to oversee both Iraq and the faltering Afghanistan war-- and not surprised that they were having a tough time filling the job.</p>
        <p>National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley told The Times he'd decided that ''what we need is someone with a lot of stature within the government who can make things happen.'' He said that top official would have the authority to ''call any cabinet secretary and get problems resolved, fast.''</p>
        <p>The immediate question, of course, is why Mr. Hadley and his team didn't figure that out a long time ago, preferably when there was still some chance of fixing Iraq's problems. For that matter, isn't that what the president's national security adviser is supposed to be doing in the first place?</p>
        <p>Defense Secretary Robert Gates did Mr. Hadley no favor when he described the job as ''what Steve Hadley would do if Steve Hadley had the time, but he doesn't have the time to do it full time.'' What could be more deserving of Mr. Hadley's time than trying to figure out a way to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan and extricate the country from Iraq?</p>
        <p>Perhaps the White House has decided that it needs an outsider to try to salvage the mess created by so many insiders. If so -- and if it manages to get someone to take on the task -- his or her most important job will be telling President Bush the truth: there is no longer any chance of winning in Iraq, so let's pull the bureaucracy together and figure out how to get out without leaving total chaos behind.</p>

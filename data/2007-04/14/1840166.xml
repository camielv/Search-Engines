        <p>Was it playoff elimination that had Isiah Thomas speaking in hushed tones last night or the growing potential of postseason calamity?</p>
        <p>If you think no meaningful games remain after the Knicks fell to the playoff-bound Nets, 100-86, at Continental Arena, think again. In the dying days of a once-promising season gone sour, trapped between what might have been and what they promise will be, come the essential franchise questions: Who is Eddy Curry, and will the price paid to get him be remembered as ruinous?</p>
        <p>The playoff pursuit was an attainable goal, a pleasant diversion, not insignificant, but never destined to be the season's defining coda. Failing to qualify meant being in the lottery -- not necessarily a disaster, given the odds against the pick dealt to Chicago for Curry procuring for the Bulls the plums of the coming draft.</p>
        <p>But those odds have been improving with every Knicks injury, every errant pass, every stoop-shouldered walk from the court. Comfortably nestled near the top of the lottery pack for most of the season, the Knicks are fading fast in the sub-league of losers. If they drop their remaining three games, as it appears they will in their depleted state, they could wind up with the league's fifth-worst record, almost unthinkable a few weeks ago.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, where the Bulls sit smug and pretty with the Knicks' pick, they are daring more and more to dream about sneaking into position to land Kevin Durant or Greg Oden. At the very least, a top-five player.</p>
        <p>But should that cruelest twist of statistical fate occur, Thomas's signature trade will boil down to the Bulls' first-rounder last year, the athletic forward Tyrus Thomas, and one of the most heralded collegians in years for Curry, a limited player whom the Knicks still want to believe has unlimited potential.</p>
        <p>In the roles of president and coach, Thomas has staked his future on Curry's variety of low-post moves, his ability to catch a well-timed lob above the rim, throw down a few thunderous dunks. Under Thomas's tender care, Curry is averaging a career-best 19.4 points, but what honest season-long watcher of the Knicks' fourth quarters would dispute the softness of that production?</p>
        <p>It is still wishful thinking to consider Curry the eventual centerpiece for a serious playoff team, not when his scoring area is so limited, when his poor recognition and reactions to swarming defenses make guards think twice about passing him the ball with the game on the line.</p>
        <p>His teammates and Thomas have spoken of Curry as if he were a recurrent All-Star for months, while ignoring him in crunch time, staking their season from behind the 3-point line.</p>
        <p>Self-serving as he was pouring salt on Thomas's wounds earlier this week, Scott Skiles, the Bulls' coach, was on point when he said: ''I don't want to minimize Eddy's year, but I mean, he's averaging roughly 3 more points a game than he did here. Eddy's having a very good year, but it seems like he's being put on a pedestal awful quickly here.''</p>
        <p>Consider that Curry's scoring average also exceeds by 3 what the Nets' Nenad Krstic -- fourth on his team in terms of stature -- was producing when he tore knee ligaments after 26 games. Would the Nets even trade Krstic, the better passer, defender and shot-blocker, for Curry?</p>
        <p>Let me say on the final weekend of what has been an entertaining season that it is reasonable to believe the Knicks would have won the necessary handful of games to at least have come close to the playoffs had David Lee been around to help Curry around the rim, had either Jamal Crawford or Quentin Richardson been stationed out on the perimeter to knock down shots.</p>
        <p>Thomas succeeded in motivating Stephon Marbury, oversaw Lee's development into one of the league's best hustle players before he sustained a worrisome ankle injury. His keen eye for college talent brought Renaldo Balkman and Mardy Collins, two promising defensive-oriented players, into the mix.</p>
        <p>Most of all, Thomas galvanized his players, rid the team of the social dysfunction that enveloped it under Larry Brown. He deserved the stay of execution, if not the ill-timed contract extension that preceded the current 3-13 dive.</p>
        <p>''I know we're better than what's going to happen in the last couple of weeks,'' he said, confusing his tenses.</p>
        <p>What about the future? What about the oft-stated plan to build his team around a big man who doesn't defend the rim or play with vitality or read situations at the pace of the N.B.A. game?</p>
        <p>Inside the locker room, Curry seems like an earnest young man, a willing student. But Thomas cannot teach basketball I.Q. He cannot coach energy or the hunger to succeed in the face of adversity.</p>
        <p>It was an average night for Curry against the Nets -- 20 points, 7 rebounds, time on the bench after 3 offensive fouls, no great impact on the result. In his 78th game of the season, he blocked his 40th shot -- albeit against Cliff Robinson, age 40.</p>
        <p>Afterward, he talked about the injuries, saying it feels as if the Knicks are playing with ''one hand tied behind our back, blindfolded.'' He said he doesn't think or hear much about the trade, how it might work out for the Bulls. He will when he goes home to Chicago for the off-season, especially if the Bulls get lucky.</p>
        <p>When the injuries hit and Thomas needed Curry to insulate the Knicks from the potential of a draft-lottery nightmare, he responded with his worst work of the season. He did score 43 points last weekend in Milwaukee but it was one game against an equally decimated opponent, one fleeting vision of the splendid future Thomas envisions.</p>
        <p>The much darker version continues to take form as this season winds down, as the Knicks slip-slide away, as the Bulls march toward the playoffs with a lottery ticket and a smile.</p>

        <p>AN article in PC Magazine last week revealed that customers across the country have received letters from Comcast warning them to limit their bandwidth consumption or face a one-year termination of service.</p>
        <p>The company, though, ''is refusing to reveal how much bandwidth use is allowed, making it impossible for customers to know if they are in danger of violating Comcast's limit,'' according to the article's writer, Chloe Albanesius.</p>

        <p>Comcast is warning its customers to limit their bandwidth or face a one-year termination of service.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>AN article in PC Magazine last week revealed that customers across the country have received letters from Comcast warning them to limit their bandwidth consumption or face a one-year termination of service.</p>
        <p>The company, though, ''is refusing to reveal how much bandwidth use is allowed, making it impossible for customers to know if they are in danger of violating Comcast's limit,'' according to the article's writer, Chloe Albanesius.</p>
        <p>Ms. Albanesius also spoke with customers who said they had already paid the ultimate penalty.</p>
        <p>Frank Carreiro, a resident of Utah, had his service cut off in January, and has been blogging about it at comcastissue.blogspot.com. He started the blog in part because ''silence will only encourage the company to continue abusing its customers.''</p>
        <p>Comcast's network security department warned Mr. Carreiro in December to reduce his use of bandwidth. He called customer service several times, he said, and was told that there was no record of such a warning and that he might have been the victim of a prank call. A month later, he said, his service was disconnected. He has since switched to D.S.L. service and is ''very happy.''</p>
        <p>The company sent a response to PC Magazine, which the magazine posted on its Web site.</p>
        <p>Comcast restricts bandwidth because, with cable broadband, heavy users can slow service for other nearby customers. The company warns only users who ''typically and repeatedly consume exponentially more bandwidth than an average residential user'' and in those ''rare instances,'' it works with customers to get them to either limit their use or upgrade to a more-expensive commercial account.</p>
        <p>The company earlier apologized for any ''miscommunication'' with Mr. Carreiro.</p>
        <p>PC Magazine surveyed other Internet service providers, including Verizon, Time Warner and Cox, and found none routinely warned customers or cut off service. Cox provides data on its Web site describing the limits of bandwidth use allowed for its various tiers of service (cox.com/policy/limitations.asp).</p>
        <p>By contrast, ''Comcast's policy, it seems, is to disconnect first and ask questions later,'' wrote Owen Thomas of Business 2.0's Beta blog, adding: ''It sounds to me like Comcast's network technicians are incredibly lazy -- or underfunded -- and its security team is trigger-happy. That's a recipe for unhappy customers, and a P.R. disaster in the making'' (blogs.business2.com/beta).</p>
        <p>But Russell Shaw, a blogger at ZDNet, writes that while suspending service might be an overreaction, ''these bandwidth hogs are abusing the system.'' His idea is to ''hit 'em with a surcharge'' (blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony).</p>
        <p>ODD JOBS -- Now that you've paid your taxes (you've paid your taxes, right?) you might be looking for ways to make some extra money. Donna Freedman has tried a lot of ways to make ends meet. ''I earned $35 for watching a porn film,'' she wrote on MSN Money this month. ''I sell my blood, a couple of teaspoons at a time, to medical researchers. I get a monthly rent credit for being the go-to gal in my apartment building.''</p>
        <p>And that's just for starters. She baby-sits and dog-sits, she mystery shops and she undergoes medical tests. Last year, she wrote, she kept herself afloat this way. She's since scaled back, but keeps her hand in it because, ''extra income is always welcome'' (moneycentral.msn.com)</p>
        <p>NOT RECOMMENDED -- A man in South Korea was upset when his cellphone stopped working. He reportedly called his carrier, SK Telcom, 16 times and visited their service center twice, but got no satisfaction. When a representative suggested that he replace the phone with a different model, the man was ready: he had scrawled ''Delinquent SK'' across his Mercedes S500 and drove it through the revolving doors at SK's headquarters.</p>
        <p>''Lesson to carriers: do everything in your power to replace your customers' defective phones after a maximum of 15 support calls,'' writes Chris Ziegler of the blog engadget (engadget.com). ''Lesson to customers: if you aim for the glass instead of the door, you can probably make it into the building.''</p>

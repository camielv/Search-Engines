        <p>A fire at a Tampa mosque and educational center was arson and is being investigated to determine if it was a hate crime, the authorities said. The fire began Thursday morning, when someone poured gasoline outside of a building adjacent to the Islamic Education Center of Tampa, the authorities said. Fire crews controlled the blaze at the empty building within 20 minutes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which investigates arsons at houses of worship, is involved in the investigation. Investigators found a plastic gasoline can at the scene and were ''assessing the situation and looking at the evidence,'' Special Agent Dave Couvertier said.</p>

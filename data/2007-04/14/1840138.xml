        <p>A New York City police detective was acquitted yesterday of some of the most serious charges relating to a 2004 off-duty car accident on Staten Island in which he was accused of driving drunk and injuring two women in another car.</p>
        <p>A Staten Island jury deadlocked on two other charges of driving while intoxicated, and the detective, Daniel Massanova, 46, agreed to plead guilty to a lesser count of driving while impaired rather than face a new trial, said William J. Smith Jr., a spokesman for the Richmond County district attorney's office. The detective, who lives on Staten Island, was acquitted of six felony and misdemeanor charges, including assault and reckless endangerment, relating to the accident at the intersection of Otis Avenue and Richmond Road.</p>

        <p>Driving while impaired is an infraction punishable by a 60-day driver's license suspension and a $500 fine, Mr. Smith said. The detective, who was suspended after his indictment in the case, was also injured in the head-on collision.</p>

        <p>''Dreaming Lhasa,'' a dramatic feature film from the documentarians Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam, is about a Tibetan-American documentary filmmaker named Karma (Tenzin Chokyi Gyatso) making a movie about the plight of Tibetans who fled persecution by the Chinese and settled in Dharamsala, the Dalai Lama's exile headquarters in northern India.</p>

        <p>''Dreaming Lhasa,'' a dramatic feature film from the documentarians Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam, is about a Tibetan-American documentary filmmaker named Karma (Tenzin Chokyi Gyatso) making a movie about the plight of Tibetans who fled persecution by the Chinese and settled in Dharamsala, the Dalai Lama's exile headquarters in northern India.</p>
        <p>The movie is filled with heartbreaking moments. Most draw on documentary footage collected and inserted by the filmmakers, in which Tibetan victims of political and religious persecution recount their harrowing stories of wrongful imprisonment, torture and exile.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the film is also schematic and filled with baldly declamatory lines delivered by a hit-and-miss ensemble. The main story finds Karma falling for one of her subjects, Dhondup (Jampa Kalsang), an ex-monk who has come to Dharamsala to honor his dying mother's last request to locate a missing resistance fighter and give him a charm box.</p>
        <p>This plotline is compelling despite its overt sentimentality, but for sheer emotional force, it just can't match the movie's documentary moments.</p>
        <p>''Dreaming Lhasa'' is a fine example of how feature films can be used to deliver urgent political messages, but as drama, it doesn't quite work.</p>
        <p>Dreaming Lhasa  Opened yesterday in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Directed by Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam; written (in Tibetan and English, with English subtitles) by Mr. Sonam; director of photography, Ranjan Palit; edited by Paul Dosaj; music by Andy Spence; produced by Ms. Sarin; released by First Run Features. At the Imaginasian Theater, 239 East 59th Street, Manhattan. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is not rated.</p>
        <p>WITH: Tenzin Chokyi Gyatso (Karma), Jampa Kalsang (Dhondup), Tenzin Jigme (Jigme), Phuntsok Namgyal Dhumkhang (Loga), Tsering Topgyal Phurpatsang (Tse Topgyal) and Tenzin Wangdrak (Ghen Rabga).</p>

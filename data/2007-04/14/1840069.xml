        <p>Human rights groups in Zimbabwe have begun to document in numbers and names an extraordinary government campaign of abductions and beatings aimed at critics of President Robert G. Mugabe.</p>
        <p>The attacks appear to be directed largely at crippling the only opposition party of note in Zimbabwe, the Movement for Democratic Change, before a scheduled presidential election next March.</p>
        <p>Morgan Tsvangirai, the head of that party's main faction, said at a news conference on Thursday in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, that government agents had arrested or beaten at least 600 party members since the campaign began Feb. 18, and that 150 had suffered life-threatening injuries.</p>
        <p>There is no way to verify those claims. But separately, a spreadsheet provided this week by one Zimbabwe human rights advocate documents attacks on 150 residents of low-income neighborhoods in Harare in the 37 days from Feb. 18 to March 26. Ninety-nine were identified as Movement for Democratic Change members, and some were high-ranking officials. The spreadsheets list nearly 100 other beatings since Feb. 18 in the Harare area, most of which occurred as the police broke up opposition party rallies.</p>
        <p>The human rights advocate, who is not an opposition party member, estimated that the documented attacks could represent as little as one-fifth of all beatings, because many victims are afraid to report them.</p>
        <p>''It's very structured. They know exactly what they're doing and who they're going after,'' said that advocate, who refused to be named for fear of retaliation. ''People are told not to seek medical treatment. They don't come to us and tell what happened, because they're simply terrified.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights issued its own statement on the attacks, saying it had documented 48 hospitalizations and more than 175 lesser medical treatments for assaults in the last month alone. The association is nonpartisan and does not try to identify the political affiliations of the victims.</p>
        <p>The group's chairman, Dr. Douglas Gwatidzo, said in an interview on Friday that the attacks seemed to have peaked in late March.</p>
        <p>''It's a continuous level of attacks, without an increase or decrease,'' he said. ''We see maybe three or four a day coming into hospital. But that's not a reflection of what's happening on the ground.''</p>
        <p>Among the injuries, the doctors' group reported, were six gunshot wounds, one of them fatal; four head injuries; and 11 fractures.</p>
        <p>Assaults on opposition figures have been a staple of Zimbabwe election campaigns during this decade, but critics of Mr. Mugabe's government say that the latest barrage of attacks is the most intense of all. Many of the victims have been beaten by police officers after being arrested and jailed; many more have been abducted from their homes. Those who are abducted are generally driven to rural areas where they are severely beaten.</p>
        <p>The government has yet to comment on the assaults. In part because most of the victims are opposition party members, many critics say the beatings mark the start of a strategy to ensure Mr. Mugabe's victory in the next presidential election, scheduled for March 2008.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mugabe, 83, has ruled unchallenged for 27 years, but by any measure his hold on Zimbabwe's presidency is at its weakest. With prices now rising at least 50 percent each month and four in five adults jobless, many ordinary Zimbabweans openly detest him, and the party he commands, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, has made little secret of its hope that he will make way for a successor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mugabe is under intense pressure from neighboring African governments, which have come to regard Zimbabwe's collapse as a regional threat, to restore some measure of democratic rule. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa was named this month to broker a political settlement between Mr. Mugabe and leaders of the opposition in time for the presidential race.</p>
        <p>Western diplomats and election observers generally believe Mr. Mugabe's party has won major elections this decade only through fraud. The government's critics see the attacks on the opposition as the beginning of a strategy to ensure that the Movement will be unable to win even a reasonably fair presidential race. In a telephone interview this week, the United States ambassador to Zimbabwe, Christopher Dell, called the assaults ''a concerted, thorough, sanctioned-from-the-top effort to cripple the M.D.C.,'' as the opposition party is known, ''by physical violence and intimidation.</p>
        <p>''He's hoping that international attention will drift away from Zimbabwe again so he can do this in the dark of the night when no one is looking,'' Mr. Dell said.</p>

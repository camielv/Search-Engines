        <p>A weakening economy is getting some relief from abroad as American companies step up their sales to foreigners, the latest data, released yesterday, suggests.</p>
        <p>The government reported both the trade deficit for February, which shrank slightly, and the Producer Price Index for March, measuring the prices of merchandise sold to wholesalers and retailers. The prices were flat across an array of products, except for food and energy.</p>
        <p>The latest numbers were meaningful, economists said, not on their own, but in the context of the last year. The United States appears to be gradually transferring to Europe and Japan its role as the locomotive for global growth.</p>
        <p>''Europe and Japan, and also most of the developing world, are growing more quickly than we are, and now we are finding ways to get a lift from their growth,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. ''It's the opposite of what happened for a decade.''</p>
        <p>The Producer Price Index fit this pattern. The overall increase was 1 percent, down from 1.3 percent in February, but well above the average monthly increase of 0.4 percent over the last six months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.</p>
        <p>The rise, however, was entirely because of an increase in petroleum and food prices; elsewhere in the economy weakening demand appears to be taking pressure off prices. The more expensive food reflected the increasing price of corn, now that so much of the crop goes into ethanol production. Other than food and energy, there was no increase at all.</p>
        <p>''That takes away a little of the sting from earlier readings on core inflation,'' said Edward McKelvey, senior United States economist at Goldman Sachs, ''and it is certainly consistent with a slowing economy.''</p>
        <p>While the core Producer Price Index has risen at an average monthly rate of just 0.2 percent since October, it jumped by 0.4 percent in February.</p>
        <p>The trade deficit narrowed in February, to $58.4 billion from a revised $58.9 billion in January, the Commerce Department reported. That was the smallest monthly deficit since November. Exports and imports both fell, but imports more than exports, mainly because of a midwinter drop in oil prices.</p>
        <p>The export decline, although involving such basic items as aircraft and machinery, struck Brian A. Bethune, an economist at Global Insight, as ''anomalous, given that the fall in the value of the dollar makes a lot of our goods more competitive.''</p>
        <p>Imports, which totaled $182.43 billion in February, continued to swamp exports at $124.99 billion that month. But over the most recent year, the dollar value of exports has risen nearly twice as much as the dollar value of imports.</p>
        <p>''That is the key,'' Mr. Bethune said, citing in particular rising exports of aircraft and other capital goods at a moment when capital investment is shrinking in this country.</p>
        <p>Given the recent easing of the trade deficit, Mr. Bethune and other economists argue that trade is less likely to pull down the nation's economic growth rate, as it occasionally did last year. That is an important contribution, given that growth appears to be declining from a 2.5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year to less than 2 percent in the just-completed first quarter, according to many estimates.</p>
        <p>Even China offered some relief last month. The deficit with that country fell 13.3 percent, to $18.4 billion -- a bit of relief that in Mr. Paulsen's view will momentarily take some pressure off China to agree to demands for a faster devaluation of the yuan, among other measures.</p>
        <p>''They can point to the February number as evidence of progress,'' Mr. Paulsen said.</p>
        <p>Still, despite the modest recent improvement in America's overall trade deficit -- $117.3 billion in January and February, down from $129.4 billion in those months last year -- the long-term imbalance continues to discourage many trade experts.</p>
        <p>''I see nothing on the horizon that will reduce the deficit significantly,'' said Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, which favors tariffs as a remedy. ''Growth here is slowing, and there has been some pickup in growth overseas. And you have a weaker dollar, which makes our exports less expensive. But these are not enough.''</p>
        <p>The mild producer price increase suggested to some economists that the Federal Reserve is not likely to raise interest rates for the foreseeable future, to avoid deepening a slowdown that is already evident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bethune noted, for example, that prices of capital equipment fell 0.1 percent last month, reinforcing other evidence that American companies are cutting back their investments in new equipment, and this on top of a weaker housing sector.</p>
        <p>''It is reassuring not to have this pipeline pressure,'' Mr. Bethune said, referring to the drop in capital equipment prices. ''When companies have to pay more for machinery and equipment, there is the potential for this extra cost to feed through to the prices of final goods and services.''</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Rachel L. Brand, by her own admission, has never prosecuted so much as a traffic case. But in January 2006, when Justice Department officials began to discuss removing some United States attorneys, Ms. Brand was proposed as the top federal prosecutor in the Western District of Michigan, an e-mail message released on Friday shows.</p>
        <p>In the end, Ms. Brand, who heads the Office of Legal Policy in the department, decided that she did not want the position and was not nominated to succeed Margaret M. Chiara, then the top prosecutor for the district. Ms. Chiara was later ousted.</p>
        <p>The four other people proposed in the message as successors to other United States attorneys had greater experience. But it was notable that Ms. Brand, a 33-year-old cum laude graduate of the Harvard Law School, was recommended by D. Kyle Sampson, then chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales.</p>
        <p>In many ways, Ms. Brand represents young lawyers with conservative pedigrees and proven loyalty who have flourished in this administration. She was active in the Federalist Society, an association of conservative lawyers that is a talent pool for those interested in appointments in Republican administrations.</p>
        <p>At the Justice Department, she gave speeches defending the USA Patriot Act and was assigned to shepherd the Supreme Court nominations of John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr. through Senate confirmation. She had the same role for Harriet E. Miers, the White House counsel, until Ms. Miers's nomination was withdrawn.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brand was born in Michigan and raised in Iowa. She worked for a law firm here, was counsel to Senator Elizabeth Dole's 2000 presidential campaign and joined the Bush campaign's legal team for the Florida presidential vote count in 2000.</p>
        <p>After time in the White House counsel's office, Ms. Brand was law clerk to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy at the Supreme Court and joined the Justice Department in 2003. Before being confirmed for her current post in 2005, she told the Senate Judiciary Committee, she had never been in court as a lawyer, although she had argued two civil motions by phone in private litigation.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Ms. Chiara was a prosecutor for 14 years in Cass County, Mich., before becoming United States attorney in 2001.</p>
        <p>The president of the National Association of Former United States Attorneys, Atlee W. Wampler III, said that appointing as United States attorney of a person without courtroom or prosecutorial experience ''is not unheard of,'' but that experience was ''extremely helpful, of course.''</p>
        <p>''If there are career assistants with a lot of experience, a U.S. attorney can draw upon them for advice,'' Mr. Wampler said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brand declined to comment.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the department, Brian Roehrkasse, said Ms. Brand had helped write important criminal statutes and developed an initiative to combat violent crime.</p>
        <p>J. Timothy Griffin, a proposed successor who was subsequently appointed as interim United States attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, had primarily credentials as a Republican activist and an ex-aide to Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political adviser.</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffin, however, prosecuted cases in Arkansas in 2001 and 2002 while an assistant in the criminal division of the Justice Department. He also worked as assistant to the special prosecutor investigating the former Housing and Urban Development secretary Henry G. Cisneros and was a military lawyer in Iraq.</p>
        <p>These people cited in the e-mail messages had longer track records:</p>
        <p>Daniel Levin, proposed as the United States attorney for Northern California but never nominated, had a total of eight years as a federal prosecutor and high-level positions in the administration, including chief of staff to the Director Robert S. Mueller III of the F.B.I., and counselor to Attorney General John Ashcroft.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey A. Taylor, proposed for Southern California and later appointed in the District of Columbia, was a federal prosecutor in the '90s and later was counselor to Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Gonzales.</p>
        <p>Deborah Rhodes, proposed for Southern California, was an assistant prosecutor in Philadelphia and San Diego from 1987 to 2003 before moving to the criminal division in the Justice Department. She became acting prosecutor in the Southern District of Alabama in October 2005 and was confirmed in 2006.</p>

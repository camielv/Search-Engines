        <p>A Joffrey Founder Resigns</p>
        <p>Gerald Arpino, right, announced yesterday that he would step down as artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet this summer, more than 50 years after he helped get the company started by touring the country in a rented station wagon, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Arpino, 84, who founded the troupe in 1956 with Robert Joffrey, will take the title of artistic director emeritus on July 1.</p>
        <p>The Price of Perks</p>
        <p>Starting this summer, the 750 volunteers at the Tanglewood Summer Music Festival in Lenox, Mass., will be required to donate money as well as time in exchange for free tickets and other perks. The Boston Symphony Orchestra, whose summer home is Tanglewood, is now requiring that volunteers donate at least $75 to its Annual Fund, The Berkshire Eagle reported on Wednesday. The changes reflect the orchestra's growing deficit and the fact that Tanglewood loses ''two to three million dollars a year,'' said Bart Reidy, the orchestra's director of development communications. The orchestra has also said that members of the Boston Symphony Association of Volunteers will receive free lawn tickets to concerts only after they have worked an eight-hour shift, and new restrictions have been placed on how they may use complimentary passes for guests. ''I think it's extortion,'' said Michael Durst of Pittsfield, who has been a Tanglewood volunteer for seven years.</p>
        <p>Foonotes</p>
        <p>Nicole Kidman, below, received the Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia (AC), the country's highest civil honor, at a ceremony at Government House in Canberra. ''Not only are you a tremendous actress, but you are a great attribute to the nation,'' Governor-General Michael Jeffery said in his commendation. Snoop Dogg entered a no-contest plea to gun and drug charges on Wednesday and was given a three-year suspended sentence. The 35-year-old rapper, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was also sentenced to five years of formal probation and ordered to perform 800 hours of community service by a Superior Court judge in Los Angeles. Trey Anastasio, formerly of the group Phish, pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance, admitting in court that he was in possession of Vicodin, Percocet, heroin and Xanax when he was pulled over for a traffic stop in upstate New York in December. To avoid jail, Mr. Anastasio must successfully complete 12 to 15 months in a drug program, make weekly court appearances, be subject to drug testing and perform community service. Julian Lennon, 44, the elder son of John Lennon, has sold a stake in the income produced by his father's compositions for the Beatles to Primary Wave Music Publishing, based in New York. Last year Primary Wave paid an estimated $50 million for a 50 percent stake in the music publishing catalog of Kurt Cobain, which it bought from his widow, Courtney Love. Mike Tyson will soon make his debut in Bollywood. Firoz Nadiadwala, a film producer, said in Mumbai that Mr. Tyson would star in a promotional video, to be shot later this month, for his forthcoming film ''Fool 'n' Final,'' an action-comedy starring well-known Bollywood actors like Sunny Deol, Suniel Shetty and Shahid Kapoor.</p>

        <p>THE flameout of the radio host Don Imus dominated the discourse this week, but there was other intrigue, including what Dow Chemical said were unauthorized merger talks held by two of its officials and the continuing investigation into the practices of student loan companies.</p>
        <p>After gritting their teeth at previous American complaints about the fast-growing trade deficit of the United States with China, Chinese officials are starting to lash out.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration hit China with a quick one-two: the imposition of countervailing duties on coated paper imports from China on March 30 in response to charges of Chinese subsidies, followed by the filing of two intellectual property complaints with the World Trade Organization last Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Beijing officials largely turned the other cheek after the first blow, expressing ''strong dissatisfaction,'' but added ''deep regret'' to their dissatisfaction on Tuesday and warned of ''an outbreak of massive protectionism.''</p>
        <p>Most experts expect trade relations to worsen in the coming months, and not improve. The decision on coated paper defined Chinese subsidies very broadly, opening the door for as many as a dozen other American industries, notably steel makers, to seek similar protection from Chinese competition.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''He's Not My Grandpa. He's My Dad'' (Thursday Styles, April 12):</p>
        <p>Our son, now 22, was born when his father was 65. One positive result of being the child of an older father is the absence of the ageist preconceptions and prejudices that most young people are prone to.</p>
        <p>Our son has always found it quite normal that his father at 87 still works full time and plays tennis twice a week. To him, ''old'' is a relative term and not a category determined by the date on a birth certificate.</p>
        <p>Magdalen Livesey  Wilton, Conn., April 12, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The claim that men in their 70s should not have children because ''to intentionally deprive a child of a father is an awful sin'' cries out for critical examination.</p>
        <p>A child born to a couple where the father is in his 70s would not have been born at all if the man had not fathered a child at that age. Does the maker of the claim think that being deprived of a father is a worse fate than never having been born at all? Has he found many fatherless people who agree?</p>
        <p>Do children who grow up without fathers commit suicide in droves?</p>
        <p>Felicia Nimue Ackerman  Providence, R.I., April 12, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It appears that the one thing all of the late-in-life fathers in your article have in common is wealth.</p>
        <p>The trend is among only those able to afford it.</p>
        <p>The average middle-class man, 65 and over, is lucky to be able to take care of himself in his retirement, much less pay for a college education for a child he probably won't live to see graduate.</p>
        <p>Sherrill Griffith  North Brunswick, N.J., April 12, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>My ''start over dad'' died at 62 when I was 7. When he learned that he had lung cancer and had less than a year to live, he told my mother that his only regret was not having met her earlier.</p>
        <p>I didn't appreciate my loss until I became a parent and saw how connected my children are to my husband. Yet I wouldn't have traded my ''Papi'' for the world.</p>
        <p>Life offers no guarantees to any of us. Grab happiness if you can.</p>
        <p>Georgia Giunta  East Williston, N.Y., April 12, 2007</p>

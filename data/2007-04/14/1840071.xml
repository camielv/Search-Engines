        <p>Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo's earnings doubled last year even though he left his previous job midway through 2006, according to financial information that he released on Friday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo estimated that he earned $1.47 million last year, up from more than $700,000 a year earlier.

        <p>Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo's earnings doubled last year even though he left his previous job midway through 2006, according to financial information that he released on Friday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo estimated that he earned $1.47 million last year, up from more than $700,000 a year earlier. Most of his income, nearly $1.2 million, came from his work at Island Capital Group, a real estate and financial company. Island Capital's connections to Mr. Cuomo were the focus of scrutiny during his campaign.</p>
        <p>Andrew L. Farkas, the chairman of Island Capital, fought a protracted battle with the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the mid-1990s when the federal agency was led by Mr. Cuomo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farkas's company at the time, Insignia Financial Group, eventually paid $7.4 million to settle charges of paying kickbacks to building owners.</p>
        <p>Eyebrows were raised when Mr. Cuomo later went to work for Island Capital, which Mr. Farkas founded in 2003; Mr. Farkas was also perhaps Mr. Cuomo's largest political benefactor during the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo left Island Capital last June.</p>
        <p>John T. Milgrim, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said on Friday that the attorney general worked for nearly three years at Island Capital and added that some of the real estate development projects he had worked on came to fruition before his departure.</p>
        <p>''More projects started coming to completion, and he got paid more,'' Mr. Milgrim said. ''When the company makes more money, he makes more money. It was tied to the development.''</p>
        <p>Officials at Island Capital did not return a call for comment.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Cuomo and Gov. Eliot Spitzer released tax information on Friday, though Mr. Cuomo released only a preliminary estimate, while the governor's staff allowed reporters to review his tax return.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo, 49, is filing for an extension to allow more time for a hedge fund he has invested in, EnTrust Capital Partners, to report its results. Mr. Cuomo's unusual move to invest campaign funds with EnTrust was also the subject of scrutiny during the campaign.</p>
        <p>Governor Spitzer, 47, continues to make far more money as a landlord than as a public servant, earning $1.97 million last year largely from rental property along Madison Avenue he owns with members of his family.</p>
        <p>The governor's earnings were also up substantially from a year earlier, when he and his wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, reported adjusted gross income of $1.35 million. They paid $768,680 in taxes and gave $141,635 in charitable contributions.</p>
        <p>The governor, who comes from a family with a real estate empire, and his wife released a partial list of the recipients of their charitable donations, which included Children for Children, the charity that Ms. Wall Spitzer founded, as well as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the Columbia County Land Conservancy.</p>
        <p>They reported interest and dividends from a number of investments, including $25 from State of Israel Bonds and more than $300,000 from investments held at North Fork Bank. The governor also reported losing tens of thousands of dollars on a number of municipal bond investments. And he and his wife paid nearly $7,000 in household employment taxes for a nanny for their three daughters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer was paid $145,916 last year by the state for his work as attorney general, far less than the $1.4 million he received in rental income.</p>

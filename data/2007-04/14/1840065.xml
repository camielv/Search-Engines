        <p>Amir Mohamed Meshal, an American terrorism suspect jailed in Ethiopia, appeared in front of a military tribunal there on Friday, but Ethiopian officials did not disclose the outcome.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meshal, a community college dropout from Tinton Falls, N.J., has been in detention since late January, when he tried to escape the war in Somalia and was arrested at the Kenyan border. A few weeks later, Ethiopian officials said, he was deported to a prison in Ethiopia, along with several other foreign citizens who had joined Somalia's Islamist movement and fled after Ethiopian forces routed the Islamists.</p>
        <p>On Friday, he left the heavily guarded Ministry of National Defense compound in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, in a minibus along with at least seven other suspects. American officials confirmed that he appeared in front of a tribunal but said they did not know his status.</p>
        <p>No news media or members of the public were allowed at the hearing, and American officials said that they, too, were barred from attending. Ethiopian officials did not disclose any details.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Ethiopian Ministry of National Defense who declined to give his name said, ''We do not know what is happening in regards to that issue.''</p>
        <p>Ethiopian Foreign Ministry officials said they were not authorized to talk about it.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Hafetz, a New York-based lawyer representing Mr. Meshal's family, said he knew ''absolutely nothing.''</p>
        <p>Still, American officials remained confident that Mr. Meshal would be released soon. This week, American officials said that there was no evidence Mr. Meshal had committed any crimes in Somalia and that they were pressing the Ethiopians to expedite his release.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meshal's name appeared on a Homeland Security Department's watch list of potentially dangerous passengers, which threatened to delay his return to the United States. But one American official involved in negotiating Mr. Meshal's travel situation said Friday that ''it will get worked out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meshal, the son of Egyptian immigrants, has been at the center of a brewing controversy between human rights groups that have accused the Ethiopian and American governments of running a secret detention program and government officials from both countries who have strenuously denied that. American officials have acknowledged that they interrogated Mr. Meshal several times while he was in custody in Kenya and Ethiopia, but said they played no role in detaining him or transporting him.</p>

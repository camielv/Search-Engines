        <p>8 P.M. (HBO) UNITED 93 (2006). The film opens with four Muslim men praying in a hotel room. It quickly cuts to the interior of a plane, where pilots have just picked up a dispatch warning them to guard against possible cockpit intrusion. Two minutes later, at 9:28 a.m., the men -- Ziad Jarrah (Khalid Abdalla), Saeed al-Ghamdi (Lewis Alsamari), Ahmed al-Haznawi (Omar Berdouni) and Ahmed al-Nami (Jamie Harding) -- have broken into the cockpit and taken control. What happens next is mostly unknown until 10:03 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001, when, after passengers try to break down the cockpit door, the plane, United 93, plows into a field in Pennsylvania, killing everyone aboard. (Above, Becky London and Tom O'Rourke as the passengers Jean and Donald Peterson.) Using information from the 9/11 Commission Report, Paul Greengrass tells the story of the passengers who decided they would rather go down fighting.</p>
        <p>6 P.M. (E!) FORBES MOST EXPENSIVE CELEBRITY DIVORCES -- Love can hurt, especially if you're a superstar earner who has managed to stay put, in a manner of speaking, for more than a decade. This special does the math in 10 of the costliest celebrity breakups ever, including Michael Jordan's current split from his wife, Juanita, which just might be the slam dunk of them all.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Showtime) CAPOTE (2005). Philip Seymour Hoffman, right, in his Oscar-winning tour de force, channels Truman Capote as Capote sniffs out the story that became ''In Cold Blood,'' about the 1959 murder of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kan. Catherine Keener plays Nelle Harper Lee, whom Capote takes along as his ''research assistant and personal bodyguard''; Chris Cooper is Alvin Dewey, the lead investigator on the case. And Clifton Collins Jr. plays the murderer Perry Smith, whom Capote is drawn to. Bennett Miller directed this drama about the collision between country and city, and darkness and light.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (BBC America) 2007 BRIT AWARDS -- Now in its 27th year, these awards -- the British equivalent of the Grammys -- honor the best pop music from around the world. Among the nominees: James Morrison, Arctic Monkeys, Muse, Kooks, Leona Lewis, Fratellis, George Michael (you heard right), Bob Dylan, Cat Power and Lily Allen, who tops the list with seven. Performers at the ceremony, broadcast from Earls Court in London, include the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Snow Patrol, the Scissor Sisters, Corinne Bailey Rae, the Killers, Amy Winehouse and Take That. The comedian Russel Brand is host.</p>
        <p>11 P.M. (Fox) MAD TV -- Calling Jack Bauer: Jamie Kennedy and Bobby Lee in a ''24'' spoof.</p>
        <p>11 P.M. (Comedy Central) RODNEY CARRINGTON: LIVE AT THE MAJESTIC -- This country-flavored comedian serenades a Dallas audience with songs about Wal-Mart, the opposite sex, bar fights and drunken revelry.</p>

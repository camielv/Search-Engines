        <p>''Redline'' tells a simple story: high rollers bet on car races along the Los Angeles-Las Vegas corridor; an Iraq veteran (Nathan Phillips) returns home to find his brother in trouble with a counterfeiter; a singer (Nadia Bjorlin) raised near a racecourse takes a driving gig to secure a record deal; she is coerced into driving for the crook; the ex-soldier must liberate her.</p>
        <p>The movie is not about redefining cinematic narrative. The wrongful deaths of relatives are avenged (twice). Dialogue highlights include ''We've got company!'' (during a chase sequence) and ''Do it because this is what you were born to do.''</p>

        <p>''Redline'' tells a simple story: high rollers bet on car races along the Los Angeles-Las Vegas corridor; an Iraq veteran (Nathan Phillips) returns home to find his brother in trouble with a counterfeiter; a singer (Nadia Bjorlin) raised near a racecourse takes a driving gig to secure a record deal; she is coerced into driving for the crook; the ex-soldier must liberate her.</p>
        <p>The movie is not about redefining cinematic narrative. The wrongful deaths of relatives are avenged (twice). Dialogue highlights include ''We've got company!'' (during a chase sequence) and ''Do it because this is what you were born to do.''</p>
        <p>But let's forget all that; this film is about surfaces, for young men with testosterone to burn, and the racing passages snap. The director, Andy Cheng, opts for a punchy neon palette, and the editing, by Dallas Puett and David Blackburn, is breathless. The camera's intimacy with vehicles at rocket velocity is striking. The cars look terrific but don't stand still long enough to let us admire them.</p>
        <p>Despite a tiresome objectification of women, ''Redline'' at least manages to preserve its heroine's dignity. Its lovers are given a fine future, imperiling law-abiding motorists on Los Angeles freeways.</p>
        <p>''Redline'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has graphic ruptured metal.</p>
        <p>Redline  Opened yesterday in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Directed by Andy Cheng; written by Robert Foreman, based on a story by Daniel Sadek; director of photography, Bill Butler; edited by Dallas Puett and David Blackburn; music by Klaus Badelt; production designer, David L. Snyder; produced by Mr. Sadek; released by Chicago Pictures. At the AMC Empire 25, 234 West 42nd Street, Manhattan. Running time: 95 minutes.</p>
        <p>WITH: Nathan Phillips (Carlo), Nadia Bjorlin (Natasha), Angus MacFadyen (Michael), Tim Matheson (Jerry) and Eddie Griffin (Infamous).</p>

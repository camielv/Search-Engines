        <p>THE flameout of the radio host Don Imus dominated the discourse this week, but there was other intrigue, including what Dow Chemical said were unauthorized merger talks held by two of its officials and the continuing investigation into the practices of student loan companies.</p>
        <p>MONEY TALKS -- As politicians and political groups criticized the radio host Don Imus for his remark about the women's basketball team at Rutgers University, advertisers used their money to make a statement.</p>
        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble and Staples led the way on Tuesday, by saying that they would no longer advertise on Mr. Imus's program, which was broadcast on CBS Radio and was simulcast on MSNBC, a cable network owned by General Electric.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, a growing list of companies said they would withdraw their ads from ''Imus in the Morning.'' Those advertisers included Nissan, General Motors, Sprint Nextel, TD Ameritrade and Ditech.com, the home loan lender that is owned by G.M.A.C. Some advertisers went even further. GlaxoSmithKline suspended advertising from all MSNBC programs and MSNBC's Web site.</p>
        <p>Even though ratings for the program surged this week, NBC and, later, CBS responded to the controversy by canceling ''Imus in the Morning.''</p>
        <p>Some media executives have suggested that Mr. Imus's program might move to satellite radio, which is mostly supported by listener subscriptions rather than advertising.</p>

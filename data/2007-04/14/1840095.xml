        <p>Editorial notes that House freshmen who campaigned against Congressional corruption are prodding new Democratic majority to deliver on its promise of ethics reform; holds that commendable progress has been made, but there is still worrying foot-dragging on key question of reform: whether to create independent entity to oversee integrity of lawmakers, rather than leaving that job solely to less-than-vigilant House ethics committee; maintains that credible integrity office could enhance, not replace, ethics committee</p>

        <p>With a healthy sense of political survival, House freshmen who campaigned against Congressional corruption are prodding the new Democratic majority to deliver on its promises of ethics reform. Commendable progress was made in January, when the House tightened its rules against accepting gifts from lobbyists. But there is still worrying foot-dragging on the key question of reform: whether to create an independent entity to oversee the integrity of lawmakers, rather than leaving that job solely to the less-than-vigilant House ethics committee.</p>
        <p>Among the misdeeds the ethics panel studiously missed were the peddling of official favors by the former California congressman Duke Cunningham, now in prison, and the junketeering-cum-bribery of the power lobbyist Jack Abramoff, which put him and the former Ohio congressman Bob Ney behind bars.</p>

        <p>We urge Congress to fully heed the voters’ Election Day warning that the House’s ethical lapses must not be allowed to continue.</p>

        <p>With a healthy sense of political survival, House freshmen who campaigned against Congressional corruption are prodding the new Democratic majority to deliver on its promises of ethics reform. Commendable progress was made in January, when the House tightened its rules against accepting gifts from lobbyists. But there is still worrying foot-dragging on the key question of reform: whether to create an independent entity to oversee the integrity of lawmakers, rather than leaving that job solely to the less-than-vigilant House ethics committee.</p>
        <p>Among the misdeeds the ethics panel studiously missed were the peddling of official favors by the former California congressman Duke Cunningham, now in prison, and the junketeering-cum-bribery of the power lobbyist Jack Abramoff, which put him and the former Ohio congressman Bob Ney behind bars.</p>
        <p>Since the ethics panel hasn't been up to the job, an integrity overseer is clearly in order. But a bipartisan House task force that is supposed to submit a detailed study of that proposal is already indicating that it will not meet the May 1 deadline set by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The speaker should tolerate no delay. Ethics reform was a strong factor driving voters to overturn Republican control of Congress. Democrats would be foolish to present recalcitrance in lieu of reform.</p>
        <p>A credible integrity office could enhance, not replace, the ethics committee by having impartial and vigilant professional investigators who were authorized to screen complaints and recommend action, or not, to the committee.</p>
        <p>Whether the new House majority has the courage for such a constructive step remains to be seen. A good opportunity to take a measure of the issue will occur next week when the task force will at last come out of private sessions to hold its first public meeting. We urge the members to fully heed the voters' Election Day warning that the House's ethical lapses must not be allowed to continue.</p>

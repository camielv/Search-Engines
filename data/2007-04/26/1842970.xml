        <p>The state comptroller released a report Wednesday accusing the beleaguered prime minister, Ehud Olmert, of improperly helping an associate during his term as minister of trade and industry in a previous government.</p>
        <p>The state comptroller, Micha Lindenstrauss, has handed the report over to the attorney general, who will decide whether to begin a criminal investigation into the prime minister, a spokeswoman for the state comptroller said.</p>
        <p>Also on Wednesday, a court-imposed silence was partly lifted on serious allegations against a prominent Israeli Arab politician, Azmi Bishara. According to a police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, Mr. Bishara is suspected of having assisted an ''enemy'' during Israel's war against Hezbollah in Lebanon last summer, and of being in contact with a foreign agent. He is also suspected of violating money-laundering laws.</p>
        <p>''According to the allegations, Mr. Bishara personally received large sums of money from abroad,'' Mr. Rosenfeld said. Under Israeli law, the suspicions against Mr. Bishara, who resigned from Parliament on Sunday and is currently abroad, amount to treason.</p>
        <p>The state comptroller's report suggested that Mr. Olmert had been involved in procuring investment opportunities for an associate while he was in office as trade and industry minister, starting in 2003. It said Mr. Olmert's actions had constituted ''a conflict of interests.''</p>
        <p>Miri Eisin, a spokeswoman for Mr. Olmert, said the prime minister ''totally and absolutely'' denied the allegations against him. The prime minister's office issued a sharp response saying Mr. Olmert had ''lost faith in the state comptroller,'' whose actions with this and other reports ''have sadly broken all records of unprofessional behavior.''</p>
        <p>The report is another blow for Mr. Olmert, whose popularity ratings are already in single digits. The state comptroller is also looking into suspicions of corruption regarding the prime minister's purchase of a house in Jerusalem, the state comptroller's spokeswoman said. And Israeli police are investigating suspicions that Mr. Olmert tried to influence the sale of a bank when he was finance minister in late 2005, the police spokesman confirmed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Olmert temporarily took over the finance portfolio again this week after his finance minister, Abraham Hirchson, asked for a three-month leave of absence pending the outcome of a separate police investigation. Mr. Hirchson is suspected of embezzling millions of dollars before he joined the government, police officials have said.</p>
        <p>The state comptroller's report comes days before the publication of an interim report by a government-appointed committee into the failings of the political and military leadership during the war last summer in Lebanon. The report is widely expected to be critical of the prime minister; the defense minister, Amir Peretz; and the wartime army chief of staff, Dan Halutz, who has already resigned.</p>
        <p>The investigation by the police and the Shin Bet internal security service against the Israeli Arab politician, Mr. Bishara, is continuing, the police spokesman said. But Mr. Bishara has been out of the country for weeks and it is unclear if or when he will return. He submitted his resignation from Parliament in a letter sent via the Israeli Embassy in Cairo.</p>
        <p>''He is delaying his return until things become clearer,'' said Jamal Zahalka, a lawmaker from Mr. Bishara's Arab nationalist party, Balad, shortly after the court partially lifted the gag order on the investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zahalka said Mr. Bishara ''utterly denies'' the suspicions against him. ''This is a political case,'' Mr. Zahalka said. ''This is not only about Mr. Bishara, but it is about the Arab minority as a whole and its political future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishara, an outspoken and controversial figure in Israel, pioneered the notion that Israel's definition of itself as a ''Jewish and democratic state'' is a contradiction in terms. He has called for Israel to become a ''state of all its citizens'' instead. Much of the political and intellectual leadership of Israel's Arab minority, which is largely Muslim and makes up 20 percent of the total population, now subscribes to the idea.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishara was questioned by the police at the end of March, before leaving the country for what he said would be a number of days, the police spokesman said. Since Mr. Bishara has resigned from Parliament he has lost his immunity and could be arrested on arrival in Israel.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bishara ''does not turn up for further questioning,'' the police spokesman said, the attorney general will have to decide at some point whether to press charges based on the existing evidence.</p>
        <p>Separately, on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Olmert met with leaders of the defense and military establishment to discuss options for Israel's response to Hamas's launching of rockets and mortar shells at Israel on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>It was the first time that Hamas, which dominates the Palestinian unity government, had launched such an attack since it committed itself to a cease-fire in Gaza last November. A spokesman for Hamas's military wing said the cease-fire was over, though more moderate Hamas politicians called for it to continue.</p>
        <p>In a statement after the meeting, the Israeli prime minister said Israel would not hesitate to take ''harsh steps'' against those who fired rockets. But Israel ''is not talking now about launching a large-scale offensive in Gaza,'' said Ms. Eisin, the prime minister's spokeswoman. ''In the meantime, we are working on the diplomatic front'' to show that Hamas ''is directly involved in terrorism,'' she said.</p>

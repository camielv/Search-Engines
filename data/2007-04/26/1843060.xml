        <p>Tuesday's first-ever charity telethon edition of ''American Idol,'' which Fox called ''Idol Gives Back,'' held up well in the ratings, drawing 25.7 million viewers, just shy of the 26.6 million who tuned in a week ago. according to Nielsen's estimates. The first hour of the two-day special, which hopes to raise money and awareness in the fight against global poverty, featured what Fox was calling ''life anthem'' performances by the six remaining contestants. Fox easily won the night's ratings over all, dominating the 9 p.m. hour after ''Idol'' with ''House'' (21.3 million). ABC and CBS were about even in second place. ABC's ''Dancing With the Stars'' results show fared solidly at 9 (16.4 million), while CBS posted up well opposite ''Idol'' at 8 with ''NCIS'' (14.1 million). The CW tied NBC, which broadcast mostly repeats, for fourth place for the night among adults 18 to 49. The CW's ''Gilmore Girls'' at 8 drew 3.7 million viewers, followed by the finale of ''Pussycat Dolls Presents: The Search for the Next Doll'' at 9 (3.5 million).</p>

        <p>Junk foods like potato chips, doughnuts, chocolate-covered ice cream and sugary drinks should be banned from elementary, middle and high schools, according to a report released yesterday by the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p>And Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who sponsored the Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act with Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said he might put the report's recommendations in this year's Farm Bill. If that bill passes, the Department of Agriculture could be required to make sure the types of foods in the report are kept from schools.</p>
        <p>Currently, foods of minimal nutritional value are available in school vending machines and at the same cafeteria line as mandated school lunch foods, which are subject to certain nutritional standards.</p>
        <p>The recommendations of the institute's panel of experts, which represent an effort to reduce childhood obesity, relied on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines in determining which foods would be acceptable. The panel also proposed portion sizes.</p>
        <p>Most restrictions on children's access to nonnutritious foods in schools are now voluntary, a system that industry groups like the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the American Beverage Association say works very well. Both groups said the panel's recommended portion sizes were too small.</p>
        <p>The American Beverage Association, in an agreement with the American Heart Association and the Clinton Foundation, is removing full-calorie soft drinks from all public schools and limiting the quantities of other beverages depending on the ages of the students.</p>
        <p>The president of the beverage association, Susan Neely, said the limits it followed were more realistic than those the institute recommends and were based on the advice of nutritionists.</p>
        <p>But Senator Harkin said the report provided ''the most comprehensive scientific recommendations to date on school nutrition standards.''</p>
        <p>''In light of that,'' he said, ''I think it's appropriate for the food industry to move toward the Institute of Medicine recommendations rather than for science to regress to what the food and beverage industries would prefer.''</p>

        <p>9 P.M. (NBC) 30 ROCK -- Batten the hatches! Jack's mother (Elaine Stritch, left, in a take on her ''Monster-in-Law'' role) blows into town on the news of his impending wedding to Phoebe (Emily Mortimer). Meanwhile, Liz deals with the difficulties of her long-distance relationship with Floyd while trying to locate Tracy, who is missing in action. Sean Hayes (''Will &amp; Grace'') shows up as Kenneth the Page's country cousin.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (MSNBC) PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE -- And they're off! Brian Williams moderates the first debate of the 2008 presidential campaign, broadcast live from South Carolina State University in Orangeburg. The Democratic candidates Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr., Hillary Rodham Clinton, Christopher J. Dodd and Barack Obama; former Senators John Edwards and Mike Gravel; Representative Dennis Kucinich; and Gov. Bill Richardson are confirmed to participate. Chris Matthews, Keith Olbermann and Tom Brokaw will provide predebate coverage at 6. Post-debate analysis will begin at 8:30.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (National Geographic) ALCATRAZ: LIVING HELL -- Al Capone spent time there. So did Machine Gun Kelly and Robert Stroud, a k a the Birdman. This documentary examines the country's first maximum security prison and the inmates who tried time and again to conquer the Rock.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (HBO) THE TRIALS OF DARRYL HUNT -- In 1984 Deborah Sykes, a young white newspaper reporter, was raped, sodomized and stabbed to death near her office in Winston-Salem, N.C. Though no physical evidence implicated him, Darryl Hunt, a 19-year-old black man, was identified as the perpetrator by a former Ku Klux Klan member, convicted of the crime by a jury of 11 whites and one black and sentenced to life in prison. Ten years later, DNA proved that Mr. Hunt did not rape Ms. Sykes and cast credible doubt on his role in the murder, but he spent another 10 years behind bars nonetheless. This documentary, a decade in the making, looks at the investigation by Phoebe Zerwick, a Winston-Salem journalist, that finally exonerated Mr. Hunt (above center, upon his release) and follows the lawyers and supporters who fought for him.</p>
        <p>10:30 P.M. (Showtime) THIS AMERICAN LIFE -- Subtitle this one ''Pandora's Box.'' Ira Glass examines overzealous scientists, including some who erased minds, others who unwittingly botched their porcine research and a couple of hot dog stand owners (are they scientists?) whose better business practices unleashed some unsavory human emotions.</p>
        <p>11:35 P.M. (CBS) LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN -- It's practically a war zone: Steve Martin, Tony Trischka and Béla Fleck play dueling banjos.</p>

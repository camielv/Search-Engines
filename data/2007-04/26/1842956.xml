        <p>THE battle lines were drawn. Among the thousands of new products unveiled at the 46th International Furniture Fair outside Milan last week, almost all of the standouts belonged to one of two camps: a cadre of neo-Surrealist designers whose sensational, impractical, often supersize work is more than anything a form of self-expression, and a more serious group of neo-rationalists, who hark back to old-school Modernists in their desire to make better products for everyday use.</p>
        <p>''No one's going to win,'' said Murray Moss, the New York design impresario, of the war of ideas brewing at the Rho-Pero fairgrounds and at the fringe shows around the city. He seemed upbeat about his prediction, reflecting a mood that had taken hold across Milan: Finally, people seemed to feel, the furniture industry is healthy enough to support a little competition.</p>

        <p>THE battle lines were drawn. Among the thousands of new products unveiled at the 46th International Furniture Fair outside Milan last week, almost all of the standouts belonged to one of two camps: a cadre of neo-Surrealist designers whose sensational, impractical, often supersize work is more than anything a form of self-expression, and a more serious group of neo-rationalists, who hark back to old-school Modernists in their desire to make better products for everyday use.</p>
        <p>''No one's going to win,'' said Murray Moss, the New York design impresario, of the war of ideas brewing at the Rho-Pero fairgrounds and at the fringe shows around the city. He seemed upbeat about his prediction, reflecting a mood that had taken hold across Milan: Finally, people seemed to feel, the furniture industry is healthy enough to support a little competition.</p>
        <p>After a grim few years of factory closures and job losses for Europe's manufacturers, and despite growing competition from China, the industry's outlook has brightened, as established markets expand and new ones develop in China, Russia and the Persian Gulf.</p>
        <p>Giuliano Mosconi, chief executive of the huge Italian manufacturer Poltrona Frau, said his company's research suggests that global furniture sales are now rising by 4 percent a year, with sales of the expensive pieces that dominate Milan up by as much as 8 percent. At the fair, the growing popular interest in furniture and design was illustrated by the presence of more than 4,000 journalists gathered in Milan, compared with just 3,000 two years ago.</p>
        <p>There was plenty to entertain them. The hottest tickets were the dinners given by Maharam, the New York-based textile firm; the Swarovski crystal company; and the fashion designer Miuccia Prada, who was celebrating the opening of an exhibition of the artist Tobias Rehberger's work at an art gallery she owns. There was even illicit trading in invitations to the party of Established &amp; Sons, the voguish British furniture maker.</p>
        <p>During the day, when the emphasis was on product promotion and sales, the neo-Surrealists did their best to appeal to art collectors, who have lately begun to pay large sums for limited editions of ''design-art'' furniture by designers like Marc Newson, Ron Arad and Gaetano Pesce. They showed exaggeratedly large, improbably shaped pieces, a few of them cringe-makingly kitschy, but many of them quite strong, including Studio Job's giant mosaic tea service for the tile company Bisazza, and Maarten Baas's cartoonish Sculpt furniture.</p>
        <p>The neo-rationalists also unveiled some compelling, if quieter, work, like Jasper Morrison's Crate storage system for Established &amp; Sons, Konstantin Grcic's Buggy desk chair for Magis and two chairs by Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec.</p>
        <p>One designer succeeded in bridging the two camps. The young Dutchman Joris Laarman combined purist industrial design with graceful distortion in his blown-glass Nebula chandelier for Flos, modeled on a cluster of vintage lampshades. Mr. Moss, who traditionally brings back a single piece each year to display in his store immediately after the fair, chose the Nebula this year. Customs officials permitting, you can see it there next week.</p>
        <p>A Little Reality, A Lot of Fantasy</p>
        <p>ONE room was dominated by a giant Pinocchio figure, clad in black, white and gold mosaic, lampshades dangling from his nose. Next door was a Lewis Carroll scene of neo-Classical-style plinths bearing gargantuan white gold mosaic replicas of a tea tray, cake plate, dish and teapot.</p>
        <p>Do any of these objects serve a practical purpose? Of course not. Do their designers care? Unlikely. Like so many of the other supersize, neo-Surrealist creations in Milan last week, the Pinocchio by the Spanish designer Jaime Hayon and Studio Job's tea service, both for Bisazza, seem destined to end up in collectors' homes or hotel lobbies.</p>
        <p>''We use design to express our fantasy world,'' said Nynke Tynagel, a co-founder of Studio Job, the Antwerp-based design office.</p>
        <p>There were other equally fantastical objects on show. Studio Job cast oversize mugs, pans and buckets in bronze for the Homework collection commissioned by Moss. While the Dutch designer Marcel Wanders concocted shamelessly kitsch giant replicas of ornamental porcelain bells, the Brazilian brothers Fernando and Humberto Campana, known for furniture made from found objects like scrap wood and stuffed animals, plumbed the dark side of Surrealism with their sinister Leatherworks chairs for Edra covered in an alligator-skin patchwork. Equally macabre was the Fall of the Damned lampshade by Luc Merx, a Dutch architect, for Materialise, in which rapid prototyping technology was used to create a mass of intertwined and eerily realistic corpses.</p>
        <p>The early-20th-century Surrealists are the prime inspiration for the neo-Surrealists' sensation-driven approach to design, but they also reference the postmodernist furniture of Studio Alchymia and Memphis, and the gaudy new rave fashion style that's currently big in London nightclubs. It's an aesthetic that particularly appeals to the art dealers and gallerists who were scouring the Milan fringe shows for new talent last week.</p>
        <p>At its best, there is more to neo-Surrealism than showmanship. The young Dutch designer Maarten Baas, for example, created an endearingly gawky collection of extra-large furniture called Sculpt, and his compatriot Hella Jongerius added playful bird beaks and rabbit ears to her somberly colored Props vases and jugs for Vitra.</p>
        <p>There was even an underlying logic to Studio Job's trippy tea service. Each piece of the mosaic was conceived as the equivalent of a pixel in a digital image. As Ms. Tynagel explained: ''If they were scaled down to their conventional sizes, the pixels would create the illusion of smooth silver surfaces'' -- just like a real tea service.</p>
        <p>The Somehow Familiar, Made New</p>
        <p>AT first glance there was nothing special about the steel dishes, ceramic bowls, paper clips, scissors or any of the other objects in ''Super Normal,'' an exhibition on view last week at Milan's Triennale museum. And that's the point.</p>
        <p>Each object in the show, which was first mounted in Tokyo last June, was chosen by the designers Jasper Morrison and Naoto Fukasawa as an example of a familiar, everyday product that was so well conceived -- even if its designer's name is unknown -- that it would be hard to improve upon. ''It's about things that feel right,'' explained Mr. Fukasawa, one of Japan's best known industrial designers.</p>
        <p>''Super Normal'' epitomizes the ethos of the neo-rationalist designers, many of whom aim to create new objects with the timeless qualities of those in the show. Mr. Morrison, for example, often models his work on existing objects, like the old wine crate that inspired his new Crate storage boxes for Established &amp; Sons. Our memories of the old crate trick us into thinking fondly of the new designs.</p>
        <p>Other neo-rationalists are more focused on experimenting with the new. The German designer Konstantin Grcic used blow-molded polypropylene to produce his Buggy office chair, with its angular but comfortable form, for Magis. Dick van Hoff, a Dutch designer, made unconventional use of ceramics and wood in his Work desk objects for Royal Tichelaar Makkum. The French brothers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec produced technically innovative pieces like the lightweight Steelwood and Slow chairs for Magis and Vitra, and low-cost Pol sofa for Kartell, which was designed to sell for less than $1,400. They also reinvented the chandelier as the compact Stone light for Swarovski.</p>
        <p>All of these pieces are intended to win us over gently, with persuasive solutions, rather than attention-grabbing bravura. ''As a designer I want to achieve a better chair, fork, whatever,'' Mr. Morrison said. ''By better I don't just mean better looking or better working, but all-round better at being part of the man-made environment.''</p>
        <p>Sustainability, Then and Now</p>
        <p>HOW can an industry that gobbles up natural resources -- and owes its historic success to persuading people to replace old things with new ones, regardless of whether or not they need them -- be ecologically responsible?</p>
        <p>One company that is exploring the possibilities is Artek, the Finnish furniture maker, which was co-founded in 1935 by the architect Alvar Aalto and still manufactures his original designs just as it always has, from wood grown in the same Finnish forests.</p>
        <p>The company, which is now under the creative direction of the British designer Tom Dixon, illustrated its commitment to sustainability in Milan at a temporary pavilion built by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban from a new composite material made mainly from recycled paper and plastic labels.</p>
        <p>At one end was Artek's recently introduced Bambu collection of chairs, tables and stools made of super-sustainable bamboo. At the other were dozens of scratched and battered Aalto stools and chairs, which Artek had collected from Finnish schools, offering new pieces in exchange.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to show how beautiful they looked with the patina of age,'' said Mr. Dixon, adding that the company has always aimed to produce furniture so solid it can outlast its original owner. ''It's a sustainability story from another angle.''</p>
        <p>A Young Offshoot Of High Design</p>
        <p>WHEN the newly married Charles and Ray Eames set up house in Los Angeles in 1941, they turned the bathroom in their cramped apartment into a plywood laboratory. They continued their experiments for the next few years, opening an office nearby, and in 1945, the same year they introduced their famous LCW molded plywood chair, they designed a collection of plywood animals -- a bear, a frog, a seal and an elephant.</p>
        <p>The animals were never produced, but Vitra, the Swiss company that makes the Eameses' designs in Europe, will produce a limited edition of 1,000 plywood elephants in June to celebrate the centenary of Charles Eames's birth. (It will be available through the Vitra store in New York, for $1,900.)</p>
        <p>Among all the adult-size furniture at the Vitra booth, the elephant and a few other pieces spoke to the growing popular interest in high-design furnishings for children. Along with the recently introduced child-size version of Verner Panton's 1959 Panton chair, the company presented a prototype of Hella Jongerius's Porcupine table. A simple work surface punctuated with holes for pencils and crayons that stick out like a porcupine's spikes, it is decorated with a line drawing on top and has a single drawer on one side. ''Then I realized that if more than one child was using the table they'd fight over it,'' said Ms. Jongerius, who has two young children and has learned from experience. ''So I drew a picture -- of the plywood elephant -- on the other side.''</p>

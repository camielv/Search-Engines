        <p>Intimacy and proximity are not the same thing. When television stars deign to appear in nightclubs, the mere fact of their showing up is supposed to be proof enough that they are living, breathing, feeling creatures who care deeply about their fans. The luckiest ones might even be able to touch them.</p>
        <p>And adoring fans, predominantly women in their 30s and 40s and 50s toting digital cameras and cellphones, swarmed into Feinstein's at the Regency on Tuesday evening to see the Ken doll of their misty, watercolor memories, Donny Osmond, up close and impersonal.</p>

        <p>Intimacy and proximity are not the same thing. When television stars deign to appear in nightclubs, the mere fact of their showing up is supposed to be proof enough that they are living, breathing, feeling creatures who care deeply about their fans. The luckiest ones might even be able to touch them.</p>
        <p>And adoring fans, predominantly women in their 30s and 40s and 50s toting digital cameras and cellphones, swarmed into Feinstein's at the Regency on Tuesday evening to see the Ken doll of their misty, watercolor memories, Donny Osmond, up close and impersonal.</p>
        <p>What they beheld -- a fleshy middle-aged man with the shrewd gaze of a car salesman -- probably didn't coincide with the vision in their mind. Their shrieks suggested that the apparition before them was the dewy-eyed boy with a toothpaste smile who recycled Paul Anka's ''Puppy Love'' into a hit in 1972.</p>
        <p>For show business is to the Osmonds what a car dealership is to other families, a franchise to be maintained with just enough professionalism to keep it afloat. Mr. Osmond was at Feinstein's to promote his new album, ''Love Songs of the '70s'' (Decca), an innocuous swatch of karaoke singing utterly devoid of personality. From that album Mr. Osmond, accompanied by a five-piece band, sang ''I Can See Clearly Now,'' ''Sometimes When We Touch,'' ''Let's Stay Together,'' ''How Long,'' ''You Are So Beautiful,'' ''Will It Go Round in Circles'' and ''If.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Osmond's shtick was of the same vintage as his repertory. There were jokes about the Osmonds versus the Jacksons. ''Puppy Love'' was subjected to a poor country parody and a flavorless Barry White imitation. Taking a swig of bottled water, Mr. Osmond pronounced it to be ''Mormon booze.''</p>
        <p>For much the show Mr. Osmond's voice was barely audible below the racket kicked up by the band. Its partial absence was no great loss.</p>
        <p>Donny Osmond appears through Saturday at Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street; (212) 339-4095.</p>

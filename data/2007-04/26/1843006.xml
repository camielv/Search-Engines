        <p>Phil Spector, the mastermind behind hit songs like ''Da Doo Ron Ron,'' ''The Long and Winding Road'' and ''You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin','' went on trial on Wednesday on charges that he shot to death a struggling actress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spector, looking pale in a tan suit and purple shirt, walked gingerly into the courtroom escorted by his wife. He sat impassively for most of the proceedings, his hand twitching.</p>
        <p>He occasionally shook his head as a prosecutor accused him of a ''sinister and deadly'' side and a ''very rich history of violence.''</p>
        <p>''When confronted with the right situation he turns sinister and deadly,'' Alan Jackson, a deputy district attorney said, portraying Mr. Spector as a heavy drinker with a ''history of pulling guns on unarmed women.''</p>
        <p>He did just that, Mr. Jackson said, on Feb. 3, 2003, when he shot dead Lana Clarkson, 41, an actress and a nightclub hostess he had met a few hours before and taken back to his palatial house for a romantic evening. A star of B-movies like ''The Barbarian Queen'' (1985) and other cult hits, Ms. Clarkson was found slumped in a chair in the foyer, shot through her mouth.</p>
        <p>''I think I just killed somebody,'' Mr. Spector told his driver, the police said. Mr. Jackson projected that statement in red on a screen over Mr. Spector's booking photograph.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spector, the prosecutor said, killed her when she resisted his advances, failed to call for help and made a ''pathetic attempt'' to ''clean up what he messed up.''</p>
        <p>Until the death, Mr. Spector, 67, a music legend who worked with John Lennon, Ike and Tina Turner and the Rolling Stones, among others, had lived reclusively for decades.</p>
        <p>Bruce Cutler, a lawyer for Mr. Spector, told the jury in his opening remarks not to hold having a ''private life'' against the defendant and suggested that Ms. Clarkson died from a self-inflicted wound.</p>
        <p>''A self-inflicted gunshot can be an accidental suicide, and I submit the evidence will show you that is the case,'' Mr. Cutler said. ''The important thing is at the time of the discharge of the gun, at the time the gun was fired, Philip was not holding that gun. We'll prove that to you. She was.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cutler, known for his blustery defense of mob figures in New York, said that the police had ''murder on their mind'' before evaluating what happened and that the driver who said Mr. Spector had killed somebody had language problems and had just awoken from a deep sleep, throwing into question his reliability.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cutler found himself ''a little bit rocked'' by a ruling from the judge, who said that he could not use statements that Mr. Spector made at his arrest saying he did not know what had occurred and that the shooting was a suicide unless the prosecutor raises them first.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spector, who is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, is revered for his ''Wall of Sound'' technique. His multilayered orchestral arrangements, married to guitars and drums, powered hits in the 1960s and early '70s and influences artists today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spector also has been known for erratic behavior and gunplay. He has been photographed pointing one from a car, and he also reportedly fired a pistol in a recording session with Lennon.</p>
        <p>The trial is sure to capture attention, being the first involving a high-profile celebrity televised here since the O. J. Simpson case in 1995.</p>
        <p>Cameras were barred at the more recent trials of Michael Jackson and the actor Robert Blake. More than 40 journalists have been assigned courtroom seats. Mr. Spector's lower profile will probably keep the trial from reaching the spectacle level of Mr. Jackson's, where fans massed outside the courthouse and delighted to his dancing at one point atop a vehicle.</p>
        <p>The sole moment of levity on Wednesday was when the prosecutor played the 911 call from Mr. Spector's driver, Adriano DeSouza, who spoke breathlessly and with a Portuguese accent as he said Mr. Spector had shot somebody and repeatedly gave the name of the producer.</p>
        <p>''Seal inspector?'' the operator asked, struggling to understand.</p>
        <p>Even when corrected, she did not seem to recognize the name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spector's lawyers intend to end their opening on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The trial is expected to last two to three months.</p>

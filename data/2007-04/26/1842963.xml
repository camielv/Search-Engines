        <p>Blu-ray discs can hold 50 gigabytes of data, making a regular DVD seem cramped. They can also make life easier for digital photographers, video editors or anybody else who needs to stash big files on a recordable disc.</p>
        <p>For those who don't want to drag around an external Blu-ray drive with their Macintosh laptops, Fastmac recently released an internal slot-loading Blu-ray drive that replaces the DVD drive.</p>
        <p>Fastmac's Blu-ray drive works with several recent Macintosh laptop models, as well as the iMac and Mac Mini desktop systems. A list of compatible Macs and full technical specifications are at www.fastmac.com, which is also an online store.</p>
        <p>Several third-party programs, including Roxio Toast 8 Titanium and Adobe Premiere CS3, can actually do the Blu-ray disc burning on the Mac once the drive is installed. The drive's $800 price is steep, but that will eventually edge downward. For now, early adopters can record data not only to Blu-ray discs, but also to standard recordable DVD and CD media as well.</p>
        <p>Sadly, the early adopters will not be able to watch Blu-ray movies on their Macs. Fastmac says several companies are working on the software to do this.</p>

        <p>The N.C.A.A. announced that it will no longer accept academic records from God's Academy Prep, a secondary school in Dallas that opened last year in a recreation center. An N.C.A.A. review of the school found a ''lack of formal instruction or organized curriculum structure,'' according to a news release. The school was opened in August 2005 in Irving, Tex., by a summer basketball coach and quickly blossomed to 40 students, all of whom were basketball players. The school sent two players to Division I schools last year: Jeremy Mayfield to Alabama-Birmingham and Tommy Moffitt to the University of Texas-Arlington.</p>
        <p>Two players from the school signed letters of intent to Division I schools this year, Marcus Brister to Iowa State and T. J. Clark to Morehead State. Their status will be reviewed.</p>

        <p>''Tord Boontje,'' by Martina Margetts, editor of Crafts magazine in London, is Rizzoli's blowout monograph of the Dutch designer's work ($75). Some pages are die-cut in a Boontje design, like a wood-cut from a Grimm's fairy tale, making the book itself a beautiful object, much like ''Until Dawn,'' left, Mr. Boontje's lacy curtain panel made from Tyvek, the polyethylene paper used in house framing ($96 at unicahome.com). Mr. Boontje, who brought an artisanal sensibility into contemporary product design, may be the closest thing industrial design has to a celebrity -- he's at the Tate and, since late last year, at Target. It's not hard to see why: using synthetic materials, he makes heartbreakingly delicate objects that look handcrafted but come off a production line. ''A complex evocation of delicate fantasy, fairy tale and myth imagery drives everything he does,'' said Franklin Getchell, the president of the design store Moss. ''It's impossible to resist.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  May 3, 2007, Thursday  A report in the Currents column last Thursday about the Dutch designer Tord Boontje misidentified the work shown in an accompanying photograph. It was the 7-by-11-inch brass-plated steel panel called ''Ivy 1,'' which sells for $59, not a curtain made of Tyvek called ''Until Dawn.''</p>

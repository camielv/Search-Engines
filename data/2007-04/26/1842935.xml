        <p>Design Within Reach, the furniture retailer, is collaborating with Airstream to develop a trailer for the mobile young modernist --''rock climbers, surfers, dot-com guys,'' said Christopher Deam, the San Francisco architect in charge of the project, ''who want to work anywhere with cellphones and wi-fi connections.'' The trailer has kitchen cabinets lined with green plastic laminate, far right, a Nelson Ball Clock and a dinette with cushions upholstered in striped fabric by Paul Smith, the fashion designer, which doubles as a bed (the table slides down to align with the seats and the cushions serve as a mattress). It also has a separate bedroom, right, a flat-screen TV, an antenna and phone jacks. ''At some campgrounds, you can pull in and plug all that stuff in, and wire it like an extension of your house,'' Mr. Deam said. The 16-foot trailer will be $49,066, in early June, through dwr.com or Airstream dealers: (877) 596-6111.</p>

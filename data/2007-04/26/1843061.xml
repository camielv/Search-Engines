        <p>On the strength of her cheerleader-rock smash ''Girlfriend'' (''Hey, hey!/You, you!/I don't like your girlfriend!''), Avril Lavigne opened at No. 1 on the Billboard chart, with 381,000 sales of her album ''The Best Damn Thing'' (RCA), according to Nielsen SoundScan. Ms. Lavigne, left, made numerous television appearances last week, and the video for ''Girlfriend'' has been a hit on MTV and online, with more than 16 million views on YouTube. Nine Inch Nails promoted ''Year Zero'' (Interscope) in a much less conventional way, with hidden messages scattered across the Web. But the album still reached No. 2 in its first week, with 187,000 copies sold. After two weeks at No. 1, ''Now That's What I Call Music! Vol. 24'' fell to No. 3, and the ''American Idol'' contestant Bucky Covington opened at No. 4, moving 61,000 copies of his self-titled album on Lyric Street.</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 27, 2007, Friday  A report in the ''Arts, Briefly'' column yesterday, about the weekly Billboard album chart, misstated the number of copies that Avril Lavigne's new album, ''The Best Damn Thing,'' sold in its first week of release to open at No. 1 on the chart. It was 286,000, not 381,000.</p>

        <p>WHAT woman -- fashion-conscious or not -- would be caught dead wearing a pair of men's shoes?</p>
        <p>A soccer player, that's who.</p>
        <p>For decades, women have crisscrossed grassy fields in Hobbit-size versions of men's shoes.</p>
        <p>No more.</p>
        <p>With the next Women's World Cup in September, many companies have released new footwear that they say has been redesigned to accommodate the physiology of women's feet (wider forefoot, narrower heel).</p>
        <p>Yes, it has taken this long. It's unclear why. ''Women are starting to shape and create their own game,'' said Stephanie Henderson, the footwear manager at Nike. ''With that evolution came the need for their own boot designed for women to help them perform better.''</p>
        <p>As Fanta Cooper, a defender for the Jersey Sky Blue of the professional W-League, prepared for the coming season, she wore these five pairs on wet and dry terrain. Each provided good traction but she said only a few of the design elements touted as women-specific delivered.</p>

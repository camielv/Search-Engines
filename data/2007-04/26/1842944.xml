        <p>A puppet regime has seized control of the stage of the New Victory Theater. Plotting bloody murder, it slaughters men, women and children in pursuit of power until condign vengeance wreaks its ruin.</p>
        <p>''Macbeth'' is back in a captivating production that allies the actorly talents of the Chicago Shakespeare Theater with the remarkable talents of the Colla Marionette Company (Compagnia Marionettistica Carlo Colla e Figli) of Italy, which traces its origins to 1835.</p>
        <p>In this swift-moving presentation (95 minutes including intermission), playing through Sunday, 13 puppeteers out of sight above the stage combine with seven actors seated in semidarkness facing the action to render a forceful, visually captivating and clearly articulated version of Shakespeare's tragedy.</p>
        <p>Here legions of troops march, caparisoned horses carry caped and tartan-bedecked Scottish noblemen, evil unfolds in the depths of great castles, a flock of birds flutters overhead, and the weird sisters and their fiery cauldron disgorge the prophecies that will lead Macbeth and his lady to deadly doings. Humans, animals, witches -- all 130 of them are puppets, most of them three feet tall. Their deeds and misdeeds are carried out in eye-catching sylvan settings and in the corridors and on the parapets of castles whose perspectives make them seem to have been built of genuine stone. In the blackouts between scenes, music composed by Fabio Vacchi intensifies the atmosphere of tension and foreboding.</p>
        <p>At least since 1846-7, when Giuseppe Verdi and his librettist Francesco Maria Piave applied themselves to transforming ''Macbeth'' to opera, Italy has been no stranger to abridging this tragedy; this production retains the play's highlights, including Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene, Banquo's ghost, the witches' recipe and the coming of Birnam Wood to Dunsinane.</p>
        <p>With puppetry directed by Eugenio Monti Colla and spoken word directed by Kate Buckley, the two companies engineer a shining collaboration.</p>
        <p>This ''Macbeth'' is recommended for audiences 12 and older. For all and in all respects, it is an uncommon treat.</p>
        <p>''Macbeth'' runs through Sunday at the New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; (212) 239-6200, newvictory.org.</p>

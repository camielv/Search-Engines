        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Imams at the Airport'' (letter, April 23):</p>
        <p>The letter writer is ''shocked'' that six imams were removed from an aircraft after loudly praying together in the boarding lounge; sitting well apart from one another in unassigned seats near exit doors (which could possibly be opened in flight, causing decompression); requesting seat-belt extensions (which could easily be used as weapons) that they then hid under their seats; and making anti-American comments.</p>
        <p>He says that their actions were innocuous, that they were taken off the plane only because they were Muslims and that rabbis and Baptist ministers would not have been.</p>
        <p>I find it shocking that the letter writer is shocked!</p>
        <p>Any airline that would not have closely questioned such conduct by any group will not have me as a passenger. You do not have a right to fly after acting suspiciously.</p>

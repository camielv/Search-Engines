        <p>Hot dogs? Check. Sun hat? Check. Robotic pool cleaner with built-in filter that takes about 90 minutes to pick up leaves, hair and sand? Check.</p>
        <p>IRobot, maker of the Roomba self-guided vacuum cleaner, has introduced two models of Verro pool-cleaning machines that swim around cleaning up leaves and other debris. The robots, available at www.irobot.com, can automatically traverse pools up to 50 feet in length, filtering up to 5,000 gallons of water every hour. A long power cable connects them to a standard outlet.</p>

        <p>IRobot, maker of the Roomba self-guided vacuum cleaner, has introduced two models of Verro pool-cleaning machines that swim around cleaning up leaves and other debris. The robots, available at www.irobot.com, can automatically traverse pools up to 50 feet in length, filtering up to 5,000 gallons of water every hour. A long power cable connects them to a standard outlet.</p>
        <p>The $800 Verro 300, shown here, is designed for concrete pools and blasts water against pool surfaces to wash off algae and muck. The $1,200 Verro 600, designed for vinyl and fiberglass pools, looks more like a miniature tank and includes a set of scrubbing brushes.</p>
        <p>Both robots use iRobot's cleaning programs to ensure that no spot is left untouched by brush or water jet. They can even travel up and down the sides of the pool, while a reusable filter bag traps floating particles. If only they could be trained to fetch daiquiris.</p>

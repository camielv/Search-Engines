        <p>Tens of thousands of rail commuters in Connecticut were stranded yesterday morning after the overhead wires that provide power to Metro-North trains were damaged, disrupting service for about five hours.</p>
        <p>At 5:25 a.m., the pantograph, which connects the train to the overhead wires, snapped off a Manhattan-bound Metro-North train. That halted service along the New Haven Line between Stamford and Greenwich.</p>
        <p>Trains along the three branch lines from New Canaan, Danbury and Waterbury that feed the New Haven Line reached Stamford, but were slowed.</p>
        <p>Before full service was restored around 10:30 a.m., 20 trains had been canceled or combined and 80 trains had been delayed. About 40,000 people ride the New Haven Line during the morning rush.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people may have the day off,'' said Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North. She added that some buses were used to ferry riders from Greenwich to Rye, N.Y., where they might have picked up trains to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But the buses were not available when Jeffrey Maron, who lives in Stamford and works at a financial firm near Wall Street, arrived at Stamford Station around 7 a.m. to take his usual express to New York. Instead, he and two other commuters paid a total of $60 to take a 10-minute cab ride six stops down the line to Rye.</p>
        <p>A Metro-North employee had said trains were running from Rye. But Mr. Maron said that when his group arrived, there were no trains, only several announcements that said one was on the way. At least twice, they were told to switch platforms. One express came through the station heading to New York but did not stop.</p>
        <p>When a train did arrive after 8 a.m., ''it was packed to the gills,'' he said. ''We literally stood on the train like cattle. It was worse than the Lexington Avenue subway.''</p>
        <p>Service on the New Haven Line was also delayed because Metro-North had to return all its cars to their proper positions, Ms. Anders said.</p>
        <p>Greenwich, one of the wealthiest communities in the New York metropolitan region, has one of the busiest stations on the New Haven Line and is home to many white-collar workers employed in New York City. Stamford, four stops farther east, is a major transportation hub, and many financial institutions have set up offices there. Amtrak riders were also affected because they share Metro-North tracks.</p>
        <p>Jim Cameron, the chairman of the Connecticut Metro-North New Haven Rail Commuter Council, a rider advocacy group, said that the equipment failure was understandable, but that the railroad's response afterward was not. He complained that riders were given contradictory information about when service would resume and what alternative routes they could take.</p>
        <p>''Stuff happens with infrastructure,'' Mr. Cameron said. ''But where they failed is on the communication efforts. There was a lot of confusion. It's the classic issue we deal with over and over.''</p>

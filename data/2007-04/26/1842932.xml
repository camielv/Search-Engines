        <p>WITH summer guests on the way, it is time to prepare extra beds. Many of those shown open to accommodate two people, while others sleep one. And some can be stacked, in multiples, when not in use.</p>
        <p>1. Duo is a 26-by-26-inch ottoman that can be used as a coffee table during the day with a tray on top. Unfolded, it becomes a 76-by-25-inch sleeping mattress for one. Made in Denmark, it is $298 (plus $48 for the tray) from Apt, 61 Greene Street (Spring Street), (800) 694-9164 or apt-ny.com.</p>
        <p>2. One2 opens to a queen-size bed. Designed by two architects, Flemming Busk and Stephan Hertzog, and made in Denmark, it is available in various colors; $998 from Apt (see No. 1 for contact information).</p>
        <p>3. The Lubi Daybed could be used as a psychiatrist's couch or a bed for one; unfolded, it accommodates two. The foam-rubber cushions have a removable khaki-color cover made of a polyester, cotton and linen blend fabric, and the daybed measures 79 by 32 1/2 inches; $749 from CB2, (800) 606-6252 or cb2.com.</p>
        <p>4. City is a sofa that opens into a 59-by-82-inch double bed. It has two individually adjustable backrests, so one person can sit while another is lying down. Created by Stine Engelbrechtsen, a Danish designer, it is available in 13 colors; $1,498 from Apt (see No. 1 for contact information).</p>
        <p>5. Duo, designed by Pascal Mourgue, can be purchased as a single lounge-daybed ($3,210) or, as shown, as a sofa bed ($6,290); from Ligne Roset, ligne-roset-usa.com (for stores nationally) or (800) 297-6738.</p>
        <p>6. The simplest kind of extra bedding is a floor cushion that folds in half for storage (and can be stacked in anticipation of a crowd). This 74-by-33-inch version is covered in taupe velvet; $100 from Urban Outfitters, urbanoutfitters.com or (800) 282-2200.</p>
        <p>7. Flip Flap, by Ana Mir, a designer in Barcelona, is a 72-by-28 1/2-inch daybed made of foam rubber on a wood frame with stainless steel legs. Covered in wool felt, as shown, it is $3,815 (although other fabrics are available or you can supply your own); at Dune, 88 Franklin Street (Church Street), (212) 925-6171 or dune-ny.com.</p>

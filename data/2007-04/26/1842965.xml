        <p>It would be impossible to build one computer to please everyone, but Toshiba's new Satellite A205-S4617 notebook sure takes a whack at it. It is powered by an Intel Core 2 Duo processor running at 1.66 gigahertz and has 2 gigabytes of RAM, which is what you need to run all the features of Windows Vista's Home Premium edition.</p>
        <p>The computer has four USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire port. Toshiba says it set the USB ports far enough apart to accommodate bulky devices that would normally block the use of the adjacent port.</p>

        <p>It would be impossible to build one computer to please everyone, but Toshiba's new Satellite A205-S4617 notebook sure takes a whack at it. It is powered by an Intel Core 2 Duo processor running at 1.66 gigahertz and has 2 gigabytes of RAM, which is what you need to run all the features of Windows Vista's Home Premium edition.</p>
        <p>The computer has four USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire port. Toshiba says it set the USB ports far enough apart to accommodate bulky devices that would normally block the use of the adjacent port.</p>
        <p>For audiophiles, the S4617 has built-in Harman Kardon speakers. The 15.4-inch screen is in the 16:9 format that is favored for viewing and editing high-definition widescreen video, and it has a resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels. To help the budding filmmaker handle all that video, the unit comes with a 250-gigabyte hard drive. The 5-in-1 media reader can handle the most common storage cards used in digital cameras and camcorders.</p>
        <p>The S4617 is available for less than $1,250. While it is not the lightest notebook, weighing less than 7 pounds, it does have a shiny black case with electric-green display lights.</p>

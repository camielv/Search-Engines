        <p>SCHINDLER--Mark. When you came into our mother's life, you also brought us so much joy. You were a man respected by all who knew you. We cherished the moments we spent together both individually and as a family. We trusted your opinions and loved your terrific sense of humor. You will be greatly missed and never forgotten. Our heartfelt condolences to your children, Steve and Suzie; sisters Lilian (Sy) and Ruth; and to your sweetheart Barbara Serota. We will love you always, Billy, Gail, Scott, Spencer and Julie</p>

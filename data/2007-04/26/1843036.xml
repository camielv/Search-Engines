        <p>As Marc Mappen, director of the New Jersey Historical Commission, has noted, there have over the years been some eminent governors.

        <p>Over at Rutgers, they've been quietly been putting together a research venture on the history, powers and issues surrounding governor's offices around the country. But as the Rutgers Program on the Governor gets going, here's one topic close to home worth pondering: Has the New Jersey governor's office veered off into the Bermuda Triangle?</p>
        <p>As Marc Mappen, director of the New Jersey Historical Commission, has noted, there have over the years been some eminent governors. (He cited Woodrow Wilson and William Livingston, the first elected governor.) There have been some less successful ones, like Harold G. Hoffman in the 1930s, who (we're shocked, shocked to learn) was on the take throughout his career, and Rodman M. Price in the 1850s, also accused of having sticky fingers, who was a flop as governor and then after leaving office argued for having New Jersey join the Confederacy.</p>
        <p>Other questions loom. Was Lord Cornbury, a colonial governor described by one historian as ''arrogance, joined to intellectual imbecility,'' a transvestite, or was that a tale floated by his enemies? Is William A. Newell (1857-60) enjoying some private joke in his truly weird official portrait, or is he, as seems to be the case, laughing at his own enormous side whiskers?</p>
        <p>But we digress. Whatever the experiences of those mostly forgotten faces peering out from oil paintings at the Capitol, the governor's office of late has seemed to be laboring under some bizarre curse as if the sign on the door should read: Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here. So as the never-ending detritus from Planet McGreevey (this week it's Dina Matos McGreevey's turn in a tell-all on her marriage to former Gov. James E. McGreevey) competes for news space with Gov. Jon S. Corzine's near-fatal accident, let us review the recent history.</p>
        <p>We could start with former Gov. Jim Florio, who was viewed as a disaster after his $2.8 billion tax increase inspired a statewide tax revolt and who, in 1993, became the first New Jersey governor in modern history to lose a second term in a general election. Compared with some of his successors, he now looks like Wilson and Livingston combined.</p>
        <p>It's true Gov. Christie Whitman was not quite run out of town, but she did start a streak of three elected governors in a row to break a leg in office. (Hers came, appropriately enough, while skiing with the swells at Davos, Switzerland.) Perhaps her most lasting moment was the infamous picture of her grinning as she frisked a black suspect, while racial profiling was a major issue of her tenure. As a reward for her efforts, she resigned to become the head of the Environmental Protection Agency in the heady first years of the Bush administration, a post about as close to the heart of the administration as ambassador to Luxembourg.</p>
        <p>Her replacement was acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, who took office on Feb. 1, 2001, and was immediately hit with a barrage of damaging revelations about his past business and legal dealings. In April -- only three days after announcing his intention to be elected in his own right -- he quit the race and then got out of politics altogether.</p>
        <p>This was followed by a scandal-free era of unblemished amity. Unfortunately, this was one of those only-in-Jersey moments that came when John O. Bennett, a Republican, and Richard J. Codey, a Democrat, each got to be governor for three days in the period between the end of Mr. DiFrancesco's term and the beginning of Mr. McGreevey's. (Mr. Bennett apparently paid for his three days -- in 2003, as co-president of the New Jersey State Senate, he was booted out of office after 24 years in politics.)</p>
        <p>You may perhaps be aware of the history of Mr. McGreevey, who in his three tumultuous years in office presided over a tabloid tale that may become the gold standard for gubernatorial intrigue, one whose 15 minutes show no sign of ending. He was replaced by Mr. Codey, who actually became something of a folk hero while serving as governor for 14 months.</p>
        <p>Now, alas, there is Mr. Corzine, who came into office touting the fiscal smarts that got him to be the head of Goldman Sachs and has become the ultimate public service announcement on the importance of wearing seat belts.</p>
        <p>Which brings us back to one more potential case study for the Rutgers Program on the Governor -- Mr. Codey, back for the third time as governor and apparently the only one to emerge unscathed.</p>
        <p>''I guess I say a novena every once in a while or maybe I don't stay long enough,'' he said of his apparent ability to beat the curse.</p>
        <p>Still, he said yesterday afternoon: ''Isn't today my 13th day in office? I'm very aware of it. And I have to drive to a fund-raiser in Atlantic City. But don't worry. I'll have the seat belt on.''</p>

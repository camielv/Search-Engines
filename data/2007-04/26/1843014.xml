        <p>Lawyers for Jacob Alexander, the former chief executive of Comverse Technologies, who faces charges of options fraud and is regarded as a fugitive, won a fresh delay Wednesday of attempts to extradite him to the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander's lawyers accused the presiding magistrate, Sarel Jacobs, of bias against their client and asked him to withdraw from the case. Magistrate Jacobs, who has served 32 years on the bench, postponed the matter, the third such delay since Mr. Alexander's arrest last September, to June 8.</p>
        <p>A deputy prosecutor, Johnny Truter, said a new magistrate would be appointed during that hearing. Another hearing to determine whether Mr. Alexander should be handed over to American authorities will take place later this year, he said.</p>
        <p>The magistrate also continued Mr. Alexander's bail conditions, including a bond of 10 million Namibian dollars (about $1.4 million) and restrictions on his movements to the magisterial district of Windhoek, Namibia's capital. He is to report to an Interpol office twice a week.</p>
        <p>An expressionless Mr. Alexander, accompanied by his wife, was whisked away by his lawyers after the perfunctory proceedings and declined to talk with reporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander, 54, known as Kobi, faces charges in United States District Court in Brooklyn, including conspiracy, securities fraud and money laundering in connection with backdating of Comverse stock options.</p>
        <p>The company's former general counsel, William F. Sorin, pleaded guilty in November to taking part in the options backdating. He also agreed to pay $3.1 million to settle related accusations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. David Kreinberg, Comverse's former chief financial officer, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander was declared a fugitive by the United States last year when he failed to return from a family holiday in Israel to face questions from prosecutors investigating the options matter.</p>
        <p>He was indicted in September on 35 counts of securities fraud, wire fraud and tax evasion, and an Interpol warrant was issued for his arrest after it became apparent that he would not return. He fled to Windhoek with his family, where he bought a $450,000 home at a golf resort and enrolled his children in a local school.</p>
        <p>Near the end of September, police officers arrested him at his home.</p>
        <p>At the time, Namibia did not have a formal extradition agreement with the United States and does not now have laws barring money laundering.</p>
        <p>But the southwest African country's president, Hifikepunye Pohamba, had signed an amendment to the Namibian Extradition Act of 1995 that included the United States as a designated country for extradition purposes soon after Mr. Alexander arrived.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sorin and Mr. Kreinberg, the former Comverse executives, will not be allowed to testify locally, Mr. Truter, the deputy prosecutor, said.</p>
        <p>''It amounts to having to prove a crime that happened in the U.S., under U.S. laws, but having to do so without witnesses and in terms of our own law and legal burden of proof,'' he said. ''We have to fight with both hands tied and blindfolded.''</p>
        <p>During bail proceedings in October, the court was told that Mr. Alexander had transferred large amounts of money from New York and Israel to bank accounts here, which were frozen at the request of Namibia's prosecutor general, Martha Imalwa. Mr. Alexander later succeeded in a court action in unfreezing the accounts -- which prosecutors said they found out about only through the local media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander said during the bail proceedings that he was going to invest heavily in low-cost housing projects with politically connected local partners. On Monday, he canceled a news conference where he had been expected to announce a $25,000 scholarship fund for Namibian students interested in high technology.</p>
        <p>Word of the scholarship program had provoked scathing news reports. An unofficial spokesman for him, Lazarus Jacobs of the advertising agency TBWA Hunt Lascaris, was later quoted as saying that the announcement ''was a bit premature.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander also placed full-page ads in local newspapers proclaiming his commitment to investing in Namibia, and has mounted a large billboard conveying the same message opposite Government Park in Windhoek.</p>
        <p>None of the promised investment schemes have so far materialized, which his stand-in, Mr. Jacobs, attributed to the legal restrictions on Mr. Alexander's movements.</p>

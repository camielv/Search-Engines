        <p>Artist's Garbage Fetches Millions</p>
        <p>Francis Bacon's trash has sold for $2.26 million at auction. The 45 lots consisted of paintings and other items that the incensed Irish-born British artist (1909-92) sought to discard in 1978 after they were disturbed by workmen at his chaotic studio in London, the BBC reported. Mac Robertson, an electrical contractor who had become a Bacon friend and drinking companion, rescued them and stored them in an attic. The lots on sale at the Ewbank auction rooms in Woking, England, had been valued at $100,000. But a painting of a dog that was expected to sell for $6,000 sold for $610,000, and four portraits mutilated by Bacon, who would cut out parts he didn't like, sold for a total of $240,000.</p>
        <p>No Jail for Willie Nelson</p>
        <p>Willie Nelson, below, and his tour manager, David Anderson, were spared jail sentences when they pleaded guilty on Tuesday in St. Martinville, La., to a misdemeanor count of marijuana possession, The Associated Press reported. State District Judge Paul deMahy fined the men $1,024 each and put them on probation for six months. Mr. Nelson; Mr. Anderson; Mr. Nelson's sister, Bobbie Nelson; and two drivers were issued citations on Sept. 18 after state troopers said they found marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms on their tour bus during a commercial-vehicle inspection on Interstate 10. As part of the plea deal, the citation against Ms. Nelson was dismissed. The citations against the drivers were also dismissed. St. Martin Parish Assistant District Attorney Chester Cedars said there was no indication they ''had anything to do with the contraband.''</p>
        <p>Public Library Acquires Gay and Lesbian Archive</p>
        <p>A major archive of letters, photographs, handbills, manuscripts, publications and other materials gathered by two pioneers in the campaign for gay and lesbian rights has been acquired by the New York Public Library. The materials were donated by Barbara Gittings, an activist, editor and writer who died in February, and by her partner, the photojournalist and author Kay Tobin Lahusen. The Barbara Gittings and Kay Tobin Lahusen Gay History Papers and Photographs will be housed at the Humanities and Social Sciences Library's manuscripts and archives division on Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>HBO has given the go-ahead to ''The Pacific,'' a 10-hour World War II mini-series with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg as the executive producers, Reuters reported. A companion piece to their Emmy-winning 2001 HBO mini-series, ''Band of Brothers,'' the new venture will follow three marines -- Robert Leckie, John Basilone and Eugene Sledge -- from the Battle of Guadalcanal to their triumphant return home after V-J Day. A memoir by Scott McClellan, who departed as President Bush's chief spokesman in 2006, is to be published next spring by PublicAffairs, The Associated Press reported. The mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato has been named the recipient of the second annual Beverly Sills Artist Award for young singers at the Metropolitan Opera. The $50,000 prize, described by the Met as the largest of its kind in the United States, goes to singers between 25 and 40 year old who have appeared in featured solo roles with the company. Ms. DiDonato is starring in the Met's new production of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia.''</p>

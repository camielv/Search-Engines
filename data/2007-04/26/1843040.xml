        <p>New York City’s revenues are running $1.3 billion ahead of projections for this fiscal year, bringing the current budget surplus to $4.4 billion, according to new figures released yesterday in advance of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s executive budget announcement today.</p>

        <p>New York City's revenues are running $1.3 billion ahead of projections for this fiscal year, bringing the current budget surplus to $4.4 billion, according to new figures released yesterday in advance of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's executive budget announcement today.</p>
        <p>The new projections, which also added $838 million to revenues expected in the fiscal year that begins in July, are buoyed in part by real estate taxes and the strength of the city's economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg has indicated that he wants to use a significant part of the $4.4 billion surplus toward paying down expected debt in future years. He would allocate $1.3 billion toward covering the projected deficit of $1.6 billion in the 2009 fiscal year, and $1 billion toward the deficit of $3.3 billion in the 2010 fiscal year, according to city officials.</p>
        <p>Edward Skyler, the deputy mayor for administration, said, ''By taking action now, we can begin to reduce these deficits as opposed to jeopardizing our future with politically popular giveaways.''</p>
        <p>In addition, the mayor's new budget proposal will include $32.5 million more over two years to address the health impacts of Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
        <p>The release of the budget begins the negotiation process between the administration and the City Council, which must produce a completed budget by the start of the new fiscal year.</p>

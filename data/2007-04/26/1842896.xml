        <p>BAREISS--Walter, was not only a passionate collector with a remarkable eye for art, he was also an exceptional human being with an eye for people he could help along the way. With his unceasingly gracious and caring wife, the late Molly Stimson Bareiss, he touched and transformed the lives of a small army of people -many artists, many not -both here and abroad. Consequently, this passionate collector of art became an inadvertent, compassionate collector of friends who remain a living monument to his guidance, support, and caring. He will be greatly missed.

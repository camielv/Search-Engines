        <p>The Smithsonian Institution plans to charge admission for part of a new permanent exhibition at the National Museum of Natural History called ''Butterflies and Plants: Partners in Evolution,'' the museum confirmed yesterday. Admission to the Smithsonian's Washington museums has historically been free; the institution receives 70 percent of its financing from the government. Some members of Congress have recently urged the institution to find ways to raise more of its own money. The exhibition, scheduled to open in November, will include a climate-controlled space full of butterflies that requires admission of about $5. The rest of the show, which focuses on plants and butterflies, will be free. The Washington Post reported yesterday that the fee was planned. The decision was made by the Smithsonian Board of Regents, The Post said, citing minutes it obtained of the board's January meeting. Fees would be waived one day a week.</p>

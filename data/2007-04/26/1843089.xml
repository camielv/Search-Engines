        <p>Iran met with the European Union over its uranium enrichment program, the first face-to-face talks between the top negotiators for the sides since the United Nations Security Council expanded sanctions on Iran in March. The talks, in Ankara, Turkey, continued late into the evening. At their conclusion, after five hours, Iran's nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, said, ''There are ideas on the table, still in discussion,'' the Anatolian news agency reported. ''We have time to continue also tomorrow. Within two weeks, we will have more meetings.'' Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief who is negotiating on behalf of the permanent members of the Security Council, called the talks ''productive.'' A press conference is scheduled for today.</p>

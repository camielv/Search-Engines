        <p>After executing 19 search warrants early yesterday in the Cypress Hills Houses in East New York, the police said they had arrested 53 people, including 23 women, on charges of selling crack cocaine or heroin. The sweep was conducted at a public housing project that has long been plagued by illegal drugs. Eighty people were arrested there on similar charges in 2002. Inspector Steven Powers said that the arrests yesterday followed more than 100 drug purchases by undercover agents, and that some of the dealers had been paying tenants' rent in exchange for using their apartments for drug sales. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday that ''crime had spiked'' in the Cypress Hills Houses, but that the arrests would provide residents with ''better, safer lives.''</p>

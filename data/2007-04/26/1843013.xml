        <p>NEW BID FOR ABN AMRO Royal Bank of Scotland and two other lenders started the biggest takeover battle in banking industry by offering 72.2 billion euros, or $98.5 billion, for the Dutch bank ABN Amro. The offer trumps a bid by Barclays for the bank. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>EUROPE IS IN A BUYING FRENZY The takeover battle for ABN Amro is just the latest sign of Europe's growing deal frenzy. [C12.]</p>
        <p>SIEMENS CHIEF TO STEP DOWN The embattled chief executive of Siemens, Klaus Kleinfeld, said that he would step down when his contract expired in September, becoming the latest casualty in a widening corruption scandal that has shaken corporate Germany. ''In times like these,'' Mr. Kleinfeld, above, said, ''the company needs clarity about its leadership. I have therefore decided not to make myself available for an extension of my contract.'' [C1.]</p>
        <p>DOW SOARS PAST 13,000 The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 13,000 for the first time and is up 6 percent for the month, its best performance in a single month since December 2003. The rally has defied skeptics who thought stocks were due for a slide. [C1.]</p>

        <p>HOUSING ASIDE, HOPEFUL SIGNS New data on durable goods orders has allayed fears that business investment was about to falter, raising expectations that decent economic growth can continue while the pullback in residential real estate runs its course. [C4.]</p>
        <p>PROMOTING U.S. MANUFACTURING United States Steel, Alcoa, Goodyear and other manufacturing companies have formed an unusual alliance with the United Steelworkers, aiming to preserve and promote manufacturing in the United States. [C2.]</p>

        <p>NOT GOING QUIETLY Fred D. Anderson, the former Apple board member who appeared to be a fall guy in the federal investigation of Apple's options-backdating policies, has instead made a statement that keeps suspicions swirling around the company's chief, Steven P. Jobs. [C3.]</p>

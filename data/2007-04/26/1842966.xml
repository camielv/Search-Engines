        <p>HDTVs are becoming cheaper every day, but high-definition projectors have long been priced with King Midas and his cohort in mind. The Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 1080, however, costs about as much as a large-screen TV and lets you project a 100-inch HD picture on any wall.</p>
        <p>The Home Cinema 1080 supports 1080p resolution -- or 1,920 pixels by 1,080 pixels -- and connects to HDMI-compatible devices like HD-DVD and Blu-ray disc players. It has a 12,000:1 contrast ratio and projects at a bright 1,200 lumens.</p>

        <p>The Home Cinema 1080 supports 1080p resolution -- or 1,920 pixels by 1,080 pixels -- and connects to HDMI-compatible devices like HD-DVD and Blu-ray disc players. It has a 12,000:1 contrast ratio and projects at a bright 1,200 lumens.</p>
        <p>The projector can be mounted on the ceiling and its lens can be configured to ensure a sharp, evenly aligned picture in any position. Its lamp has low and high settings and offers about 3,000 hours of viewing time before it needs replacing.</p>
        <p>While most HD projectors cost more than $4,000, the PowerLite Home Cinema, which is available now from stores and online retailers, is about $3,000. At that price, even Midas's poor relations can have their fill of wall-blanketing movies.</p>

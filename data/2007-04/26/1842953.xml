        <p>The Finnish composer Kimmo Hakola is less well known to American listeners than several of his compatriots, but if the four imaginative, spirited scores performed at the Miller Theater on Tuesday evening are a fair representation of his work, that is bound to change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hakola's bona fides will sound familiar to anyone who has admired the music of Finnish composers in recent years. Like Magnus Lindberg, Kaija Saariaho and Esa-Pekka Salonen, Mr. Hakola, 48, was trained at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki. His best-known teacher was Einojuhani Rautavaara, but his music sounds nothing like Mr. Rautavaara's or, for that matter, like anyone else's. He appears to have sidestepped the century-long debate about the merits of tonality and refused to join any philosophical or stylistic camp.</p>

        <p>The Finnish composer Kimmo Hakola is less well known to American listeners than several of his compatriots, but if the four imaginative, spirited scores performed at the Miller Theater on Tuesday evening are a fair representation of his work, that is bound to change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hakola's bona fides will sound familiar to anyone who has admired the music of Finnish composers in recent years. Like Magnus Lindberg, Kaija Saariaho and Esa-Pekka Salonen, Mr. Hakola, 48, was trained at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki. His best-known teacher was Einojuhani Rautavaara, but his music sounds nothing like Mr. Rautavaara's or, for that matter, like anyone else's. He appears to have sidestepped the century-long debate about the merits of tonality and refused to join any philosophical or stylistic camp.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hakola's music scampers about mischievously, mixing together shapely lyricism, atonality, quirky folkishness and an almost hedonistic approach to timbre and rhythm. And when he provides titles or character indications, he willfully subverts them. You might expect a movement marked Misterioso, for example, to be quiet, slow and introspective. But the Misterioso finale of Mr. Hakola's Chamber Concerto (2002) is brisk, texturally transparent and bursting with jaunty violin figures and celebratory trumpet themes. It's perverse -- in a good way.</p>
        <p>The program was performed by Present Music, the Milwaukee-based ensemble that commissioned the Chamber Concerto. The group opened its program with ''Arara Zagrara,'' a work written for three accordions in 1995 and rescored for strings, woodwinds and percussion in 2002. Its opening clarinet theme has the accents and vitality of klezmer, but when the oboe picks it up, the line takes on a more modal quality. Gradually, the full ensemble finds its way into the work, creating a joyfully cacophonous sound in which the players seem to be jostling for a share of the limelight.</p>
        <p>The work's morphing and jostling effects propel parts of the Chamber Concerto as well. The Tempestuoso movement begins with brusque string chords borrowed from Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' but takes only a few moments to become vigorous folk fiddling. Hints of jazz find their way into the trumpet solo of the Amoroso movement and the saxophone and vibraphone writing in Forza con Fuoco.</p>
        <p>A solo piano work, ''Theme, 11 Ã‰tudes and a Grand Cadenza'' (1998), draws on the sound worlds and technical armories of Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Liszt and Prokofiev, including rippling arpeggios, forceful chord progressions, pointillistic darting to the extremes of the keyboard. Phillip Bush mined it for its full virtuosic tonnage. And in ''Capirole'' (1991), William Helmers gave a high-energy account of the sprightly bass clarinet line, against which Karl Lavine negotiated Mr. Hakola's alternately chunky and lyrical cello writing.</p>

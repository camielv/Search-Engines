      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Ikea, the company known for its low-priced, flat-packed furniture, has introduced a new 82-piece collection called Stockholm -- furniture that is slightly more expensive because it is made of higher-quality materials, according to Ikea, and requires less assembly than the company's other lines. Each of the pieces is associated with a particular Swedish designer. The extra wide armchair, above, is covered in red or beige velvet and costs $699. A sofa that seats three or more, which comes with a removable fabric cover or in dark brown leather, is $1,399; a swivel footstool in pony skin or velvet is $299; and the oak-veneer cupboard, right, is $399. There are lamps, fabrics, rugs and vases as well; at Ikea stores, (800) 434-4532 or ikea.com.</p>

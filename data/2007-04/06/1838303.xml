        <p>Editorial says New Jersey, which has shortchanged its public pension fund, should be cautionary tale for states tempted to use money from public pension funds for more immediate gratifications; says elected officials must honestly explain to voters that starving state pension funds is not lasting or moral solution</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>It would be naïve to believe that the rot in New Jersey's public pension system is limited to New Jersey. The Times's Mary Williams Walsh reported on Wednesday that over the last decade, various New Jersey legislatures and governors have routinely shortchanged the state's public pension fund, while overstating the amounts that were contributed, sometimes by hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Among the unorthodox and possibly illegal tactics, state officials pretended that a stock market windfall from 1999, which had disappeared with the dot-com bubble, was still on the books. They also counted funds earmarked for health care benefits as pension contributions. The gap between what officials said was contributed and what the records show is so large that it's currently impossible to say how much is actually in the state pension system. But one thing is sure. The reported assets of $79 billion are far too low to meet future obligations to the state's teachers, firefighters, police officers and other public employees.</p>

        <p>Among the unorthodox and possibly illegal tactics, state officials pretended that a stock market windfall from 1999, which had disappeared with the dot-com bubble, was still on the books. They also counted funds earmarked for health care benefits as pension contributions. The gap between what officials said was contributed and what the records show is so large that it's currently impossible to say how much is actually in the state pension system. But one thing is sure. The reported assets of $79 billion are far too low to meet future obligations to the state's teachers, firefighters, police officers and other public employees.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, the state Constitution forbids cutting earned pension benefits, so the payments will have to be made. To make good, the state will have to raise taxes, cut spending, sell assets or some combination of the three. At present, the New Jersey Turnpike is reportedly being considered for the auction block. It all adds up to extreme fiscal pain, mostly self-inflicted.</p>
        <p>While other states may not have indulged in iffy accounting to the extent that New Jersey has, many have faced the same political pressure: constituents demand tax cuts, but do not want to endure the government spending cuts that lower revenue implies. So officials are tempted to fiddle with the state pension law, using the money that would otherwise fund the pension for more immediate gratifications. In California, the teachers' pension fund is currently suing the state for withholding a $500 million contribution, first delayed under the previous governor, Gray Davis, and held up to this day under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
        <p>Worse than the lack of money is the failure of elected officials to honestly explain to voters that tax cuts must be paid for -- and that starving the state pension funds is not a lasting or moral solution. For states that don't yet have their backs to the wall, New Jersey should be a cautionary tale.</p>

        <p>A judge said Thursday that he would seal any psychological evaluations of Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, the former astronaut accused of trying to kidnap a romantic rival.</p>
        <p>He also ordered lawyers in the case not to issue press releases, and he scheduled a hearing for Monday to determine whether additional documents should be sealed.</p>
        <p>The judge, Marc L. Lubet of Orange County Circuit Court, warned that continuing communication by lawyers with the news media ''will keep this case stoked up in the press,'' and he said he would like to keep the trial in Orange County ''if at all possible.''</p>
        <p>Captain Nowak, of the Navy, was arrested in February and later fired by NASA after, according to an arrest affidavit, she confronted a rival for the affections of a fellow astronaut in an Orlando airport parking lot and attacked her with pepper spray. The police said she had driven all night from her home in Texas, wearing a diaper so she would not have to stop to relieve herself.</p>
        <p>The police said they found a compressed-air pistol, a steel mallet, a knife and rubber tubing in her possession and charged her with attempted kidnapping, among other charges. Captain Nowak, a 43-year-old mother of three, has pleaded not guilty.</p>
        <p>The judge's effort to limit access to information about the case is unusual, said Michael L. Seigel, a professor at the Levin College of Law at the University of Florida.</p>
        <p>''As a general rule, it's a really rare practice because it does interfere with the public's right to know,'' Professor Seigel said. ''Because we're dealing in this case with things that have special sensitivity, like psychological evaluations, that can sort of tip the scales toward what the judge did, but it's definitely the exception rather than the rule.''</p>
        <p>Judge Lubet also suggested a trial date in September, rather than in July or August as originally proposed, to avoid continuances. He asked Captain Nowak's lawyer, Donald A. Lykkebak, to provide a waiver of her right to a speedy trial to allow for such a date. Mr. Lykkebak also asked that personal items retrieved from Captain Nowak's car the night of her arrest be sealed, items that he said were not involved in the case. Releasing them would be an invasion of privacy, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lykkebak confirmed that the defense was evaluating Captain Nowak's mental health.</p>
        <p>But an insanity defense might not be the best legal approach, Professor Seigel said.</p>
        <p>''A traditional insanity defense labels her as mentally ill,'' he said, ''and she would have to serve time in a mental institution that could turn out to be longer than a jail sentence. Given the circumstances and her mental state, it would seem to me she would be able to get a reasonably good deal, and that may be the way out.''</p>

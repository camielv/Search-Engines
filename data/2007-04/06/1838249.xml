        <p>(Tonight through Thursday) A three-week series of seriously obscure American musicals, presented as only Bruce Goldstein, the canny repertory programmer of Film Forum, knows how to do. The ''B-Musical'' umbrella is a bit misleading in that several of the pictures don't fit the strict constructionist interpretation of a B-picture (seldom more than 70 minutes; made for the bottom half of a double bill; booked at a flat rather than percentage rate), but who's counting? Among this week's highlights are an Andrews Sisters triple bill on Sunday (including ''Buck Privates'' with Abbott and Costello); three films starring the yodeling country comedian Judy Canova, introduced by her daughter Diana Canova, on Monday; and ''Crazy House,'' Olsen and Johnson's rarely seen follow-up to their great surrealist burlesque, ''Hellzapoppin','' on Tuesday. An exceedingly strange triple bill on Thursday consists of musicals by directors best known for violent, angst-ridden films noirs: Phil Karlson's ''Ladies of the Chorus'' (1949, left, with Marilyn Monroe and Rand Brooks), Anthony Mann's ''Moonlight in Havana'' (1942) and Joseph H. Lewis's ''Minstrel Man'' (1944). The series ends April 19 with a tribute to the queen of the B-musicals, Columbia Pictures' tap-dancing Texan, Ann Miller. (Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, 212-727-8110, filmforum.org; $10.50.)</p>

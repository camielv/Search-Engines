        <p>10 P.M. (TLC) SHUT UP! IT'S STACY LONDON The Queen of Style finally gets her own throne in a new talk show. This sneak peek gives a taste of what's to come this fall, when the show moves into the regular TLC lineup alongside ''What Not to Wear'' (see below), Ms. London's flagship. In ''Shut Up!,'' Ms. London, left, will do what she does best, offering advice on how to just say no to bad fashion and relationship choices with the help of experts and a bevy of beauty wizards. Segments include ''My Life in Five Outfits,'' which traverses a celebrity's career through clothes. Tonight's test run includes the actresses Jane Krakowski and Lisa Rinna, the shoe designer Kristen Lee and the author Ron Geraci. Clinton Kelly fans, never fear: Mr. Kelly, Ms. London's endearing ''W.N.T.W.'' co-host, will be helping Americans adjust their p's and q's in ''Mind Your Manners,'' also going on the air this fall.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CBS) GHOST WHISPERER It's hard enough being single again without this. When the dead husband of Delia (Camryn Manheim) tries to sabotage her date, Melinda (Jennifer Love Hewitt) puts their friendship to the test by helping him to cross over. Viewers who can't get enough spiritual interaction in the show can log on to www.cbs.com/ghost for ''Ghost Whisperer: The Other Side,'' an online companion series shot from the perspective of Zach (Mark Hapka), a bike courier turned earthbound spirit who has a few questions regarding his death. New episodes appear on the site every Friday.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CMT) THE ULTIMATE COYOTE UGLY SEARCH You can bet there'll be plenty of howling in the second season of this competition series as nine veterans of the Coyote Ugly chain founded by Liliana Lovell sing, dance, tend bar and flare for the chance to be named, with a novice partner, the country's best female barkeep. The incentive: a wild $50,000.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TLC) WHAT NOT TO WEAR: BEHIND THE SEAMS Think those sneak attacks on unwitting fashion victims seem just a little too consistently cheery? Or that said victim's favorite holey PJs -- the ones worn for supermarket shopping -- are normally relinquished without a struggle? In this hourlong special Stacy London and Clinton Kelly reveal some of the secrets of the makeover show's success, like how they keep participants' frayed nerves from totally unraveling on the quest for wardrobe nirvana.</p>
        <p>MIDNIGHT (HBO) P. DIDDY PRESENTS THE BAD BOYS OF COMEDY Diddy gives it up to a new round of rising comedians in the second-season premiere of this stand-up series. Tonight, Drew Fraser, Damn Fool, Ian Edwards and Will-E Robo take the stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, introduced by the rapper Doug E. Fresh and backed up by tracks from DJ Mister C. Viewers can watch Diddy's reaction via video shot backstage in the green room.</p>

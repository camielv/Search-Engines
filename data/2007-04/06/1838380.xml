        <p>''F.B.I. agent shot in showdown with bank robbers.''</p>
        <p>The sentence evokes an image out of the Depression, of G-men in fedoras facing down the likes of Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd somewhere in the lawless Midwest.</p>
        <p>But fatal shootings of F.B.I. agents have been relatively rare -- in the 1930s as well as today. Barry Lee Bush, the special agent shot dead yesterday near a highway in suburban New Jersey, was the 51st to die in the line of duty in the agency's 99-year history.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was the first agent to be fatally shot on the job in 10 years. But from 1986 to 1996, nine agents were killed by gunfire, one more than in the 1930s.</p>
        <p>Still, there is something to the stereotype. Ronald Kessler, who wrote ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the F.B.I.,'' said that in the past, the F.B.I. made a point of chasing the kind of high-visibility cases that often had violent denouements.</p>
        <p>''The F.B.I. under J. Edgar Hoover went out of its way to publicize itself and trumpet its successes and its tragedies,'' Mr. Kessler said. ''They didn't want to get involved in cases that were very complex.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Kessler said, especially since 9/11, the bureau has devoted more resources to investigating terrorists and fighting online crime, and tends to stay out of investigations that the local police seem qualified to handle.</p>
        <p>''In this case, where there were a number of robberies that seemed to be related, it makes sense that the F.B.I. would be involved,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The bureau's low death rate, Mr. Kessler said, had a lot to do with a policy of using overwhelming force when moving in for an arrest.</p>
        <p>But when an agent does get killed, it tends to be in the same sorts of confrontations, according to accounts on the F.B.I.'s Web site.</p>
        <p>The first agent killed in the line of duty, Edwin C. Shanahan, was shot by a car thief in an underground garage in Chicago in 1925.</p>
        <p>In 1953, Special Agent J. Brady Murphy died in a shootout with a murder suspect in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>And in 1990, Special Agent John L. Bailey confronted a bank robber in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>''S. A. Bailey frisked the robber and placed him on a chair,'' the F.B.I.'s Web site says. ''However, S. A. Bailey's attention was apparently diverted and the bank robber lunged at S. A. Bailey, knocking the agent's gun out of his hand. The bank robber recovered his own weapon and shot S. A. Bailey three times.''</p>

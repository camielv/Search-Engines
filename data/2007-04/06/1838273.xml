        <p>Jake Kasdan, the writer and director of ''The TV Set,'' was also among the creators of ''Freaks and Geeks,'' one of those shows that drew a fatally small but unusually ardent audience. It may have been too smart for the medium, and Mr. Kasdan is thus perhaps ideally suited to making a knowing, behind-the-scenes sendup of network television. He has seen how it works and lived to tell the tale.</p>
        <p>Show business satire is a tricky genre, at once too easy and too hard. The manners and mores of the Hollywood executive class -- the new-age management lingo, the smiling hostility, the mix of forced casualness and status anxiety -- all of this pretty much makes fun of itself. So do the neuroses of the various ''creatives,'' as actors, writers and directors are sometimes called.</p>
        <p>The difficulty is to push past facile caricature and glib moralizing about art versus commerce into the murky machinery of the culture industry. ''The Player,'' Robert Altman's prescient 1992 poison-pen letter to the movie studios, accomplished this, as did ''The Larry Sanders Show.'' On a smaller scale, within a narrower compass, Mr. Kasdan's film comes close.</p>
        <p>The hero, his angst hidden behind a heavy beard and a sardonic manner, is Mike (David Duchovny), who is making a pilot for a semi-autobiographical sitcom with some ''dark'' elements. He is supported -- which is to say undermined -- by his cheery manager (Judy Greer), who speaks almost entirely in industry clichés (''we're all on the same page,'' ''at the end of the day,'' etc.), and by two network production executives.</p>
        <p>The big boss is Lenny, played with predatory abandon by Sigourney Weaver. Her underling, a new hire from the BBC uncomfortably relocated to Los Angeles, is Richard (Ioan Gruffudd), who seems sincere in his desire to be on Mike's side.</p>
        <p>But an old adage says that once you can fake sincerity, everything else is easy. The challenge facing Mr. Kasdan and his cast is how to balance realism with comedy. One of the actors, a cretin named Zach (Fran Kranz), likes to babble about finding the right middle ground between broadness and nuance. (An amusing subplot involves his attempt to spark an on-set romance with his co-star, played by the delightful Lindsay Sloane).</p>
        <p>Zach always errs on the side of broadness, and Mr. Kasdan clearly prefers to push in the other direction. At times ''The TV Set'' seems to unfold almost entirely without exaggeration. The jokes are things people shooting a pilot might actually say; the telling episodes of vanity or stupidity are entirely believable. The plot -- an original idea is in danger of being compromised and sanitized, with the reluctant participation of its creator -- is something that happens so often that it hardly even counts as a story.</p>
        <p>Which is not to say that ''The TV Set'' quite follows the fake-documentary blueprint that has become nearly ubiquitous in movies and TV series about movies and television. It is simpler and more linear, and it might have worked as a pilot in its own right. The humor is threaded almost invisibly beneath the surface. Early on, we see Lenny standing in front of a schedule grid. Since some of the names on it belong to actual shows, you almost miss the ones that aren't, since they might as well be.</p>
        <p>For example there is a show called ''Slut Wars.'' I chuckled when I noticed it, but then realized that I couldn't be sure it was a joke. When the show comes up again, it clearly is a joke, but only for the technical reason that it doesn't exist outside the movie. If it did -- when it does? -- it would be another sign of the decline of civilization. Or a huge hit. Or both.</p>
        <p>''The TV Set'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some profanity and sexual references.</p>
        <p>The TV Set  Opens today in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Written and directed by Jake Kasdan; director of photography, Uta Brierewitz; edited by Tara Timpone; music by Michael Andrews; production designer, Jefferson Sage; produced by Aaron Ryder and Mr. Kasdan; released by ThinkFilm. Running time: 89 minutes.</p>
        <p>WITH: David Duchovny (Mike Klein), Sigourney Weaver (Lenny), Ioan Gruffudd (Richard McCallister), Judy Greer (Alice), Fran Kranz (Zach Harper) and Lindsay Sloane (Laurel Simon).</p>

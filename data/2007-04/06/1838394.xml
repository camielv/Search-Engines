        <p>as = poaching the poachers  Rivington Arms  4 East Second Street, East Village  Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>It may not be possible to be much more ostentatiously ambivalent about making art or exhibiting in a gallery than the artist and writer Darren Bader is in his abjectly nonchalant, if weirdly engaging, second solo show at Rivington Arms. Meandering, back-pedaling written instructions accompany several pieces in the front room, making references at times to off-site locations in Manhattan and Queens for further viewing, sometimes intimating off-site treasure hunts to Queens.</p>
        <p>The art objects, which may or may not be finished, include the catalog to last year's Art Basel Miami Beach and a jar of tahini. ''Prototype 3,'' an attenuated installation in the second room, offers nonsensical time lines of two films: Steven Spielberg's headlong ''War of the Worlds'' (in ocher) and Bela Tarr's majestically slow-moving ''Damnation'' (in violet), which play alternately on a wall-mounted monitor. During my visit ''Damnation'' was playing, its sound, sadness and luminous black and white lending an elegiac mood; the Spielberg would change the show's tone entirely.</p>
        <p>Lines of crayon color sometimes connect the non sequiturs on the time lines to drawings, found photographs and objects that dot the walls and floor or are arrayed on small shelves. The cryptic, run-on checklist includes, just for example, ''junk fax 1/fake Max Ernst/found photo (zebra)/crossword puzzle with white vinegar.'' The mind wanders and then snaps to attention at, say, an image of a tiny baby and a python. Nothing is connected, and everything is.</p>
        <p>Sentimentality and a certain preciousness are the pitfalls here. The strengths include the rending asunder of reading and looking into participatory stream of consciousness and occasional, deliberate moments of beauty and even finish. Note the bright specificity of the ocher and violet time lines, for example.</p>

        <p>In seeking their support for his presidential campaign, Mitt Romney has struggled over the last few months to reassure Republican conservatives that he is one of them.</p>
        <p>When asked on Tuesday about his stance on guns, Mr. Romney, as he has more than once, portrayed himself as a sportsman, a ''hunter pretty much all my life,'' who strongly supported a right to bear arms.</p>
        <p>He even trotted out some remembrances, recalling that in hunting with his cousins as a teenager, he struggled to kill rabbits with a single-shot .22-caliber rifle. When they lent him a semiautomatic, it got a lot easier, he said, drawing laughs from an appreciative crowd in Keene, N.H. The last time he went hunting, he said, was last year, when he shot quail in Georgia and ''knocked down quite a few birds.''</p>
        <p>''So I've been pretty much hunting all my life,'' he said again.</p>
        <p>But on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported that Mr. Romney had in fact been hunting only twice: once during that summer when he was 15 and spending time at a relative's ranch in Idaho, and again on the occasion last year, a quail shoot at a fenced-in game preserve in Georgia with major donors to the Republican Governors Association.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, with Mr. Romney facing reporters' repeated questions about the A.P. account, his campaign was forced to address his hunting résumé. A campaign spokesman, Eric Fehrnstrom, said Mr. Romney had gone hunting repeatedly during his teenage summer at the ranch. Mr. Romney has also shot small game on his Utah property, said Mr. Fehrnstrom, who added that he did not know how often.</p>
        <p>''Mitt Romney is not a big-game hunter,'' he said, ''but he knows how to handle a firearm.''</p>
        <p>In any event, the spokesman said, the candidate's support for gun rights comes not from any hunting background but rather ''from his respect and appreciation for the rights enshrined in our Constitution.''</p>
        <p>''He fundamentally understands the Second Amendment does more than protect the rights of hunters,'' Mr. Fehrnstrom said. ''It protects the rights of all Americans to bear arms, to protect themselves and their property.''</p>

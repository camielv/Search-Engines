        <p>Like most great New York spectacles, the Easter Parade is participatory, informal and fashion-driven. Less a parade than a costumed stroll, the event was born in the 1800s, when Manhattan's elite would preen in their holiday finery in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral and other grand churches, then still in the northern outskirts of the city. Before they realized that New Yorkers consider it gauche to gawk, the less privileged would travel uptown to mingle with the wealthy. But over the years the procession (which has no official organizer) evolved from a stiff observance of society types to a casual, silly affair for the wildly dressed masses (and their pets). And one key part of the tradition, the Easter bonnet, has survived, though now the custom-made chapeaus and top hats are joined by towering creations involving action figures, stuffed animals, feathers, and of course eggs. Lee Ilan, 41, an environmental planner and 10-year veteran of the parade, has worn the Chrysler Building, Shea Stadium and the Gates on her head; this year she will be sporting the Coney Island Cyclone. ''The first year I saw somebody who had done the Last Supper made out of Ken dolls,'' she said. ''That was heavy. Literally.'' Go celebrate the new season and the creativity of urbanites; gawkers welcome. But hopping in is better. (Sunday, Fifth Avenue, between 44th and 57th Streets, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.)</p>

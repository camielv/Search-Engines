        <p>An article on Saturday about a delay in a deposition for lawsuits against New York City over arrests during the 2004 Republican National Convention misstated the context of a response by Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman. Mr. Browne was responding to a general question about a pre-convention surveillance program when he said, ''No comment on anything that may have a bearing on pending litigation.'' He says he was not in fact addressing a question about an apparent discrepancy between statements by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and himself about whether that surveillance had uncovered a plot to bomb a subway station.</p>

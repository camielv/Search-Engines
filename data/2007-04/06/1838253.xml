        <p>Through the 1990s the German photographer Thomas Struth became an art-world celebrity for his outsize, absorbing portraits of crowds interacting with artwork in the world's great museums. As a follow-up, he is presenting the American premiere of two new series of pictures of audiences beholding single masterpieces in the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The show, at Marian Goodman Gallery in Midtown, is one of the most visually sumptuous and thought-provoking in the city. Both series of photographs are from 2005, though they are completely different in style, tone, spirit and intent. The pictures of students and tourists at the Prado (above), milling about and chatting in front of various paintings of great attention, fame and devotion, contrive to get us thinking about a cocktail of cultural concerns -- the aura of masterpieces, museums as promenades, art tourism -- to which he adds a touch of farce. Almost nobody in the pictures is looking at the paintings. By contrast, the pictures of crowds pressed in close around Leonardo da Vinci's ''Litta Madonna'' and ''Benois Madonna'' at the Hermitage are deviously direct, the artist zooming in his lens on the facial expressions of the crowd to the exclusion of the paintings. These pictures are a sort of guilty pleasure, owing almost entirely to the cleverness of the artist, who allows us safely to look at others looking at art. You only hope that he is not lurking around the gallery here somewhere with a camera at the ready. (Through April 28, Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, Manhattan, 212-977-7160, mariangoodman.com.)</p>

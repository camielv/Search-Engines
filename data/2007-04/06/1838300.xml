        <p>The conservative presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy abruptly canceled a campaign visit to a neighborhood of the eastern city of Lyon on Thursday as protesters gathered there, warning that he would not be welcome.</p>
        <p>About 100 demonstrators gathered in the Croix-Rousse neighborhood in central Lyon, some brandishing signs that read, ''Sarkozy, you are not welcome here,'' others shouting, ''Scum'' and ''Karcher.''</p>
        <p>Some supporters of Mr. Sarkozy shouted, ''Sarkozy, president,'' but were drowned out by the demonstrators.</p>
        <p>The words ''scum'' and ''Karcher'' have come to be both identified with Mr. Sarkozy and emblematic of his difficult relationship with France's ethnic Arab and African populations. As France's law-and-order interior minister, a job he left last week, Mr. Sarkozy alienated a huge swath of inhabitants in the troubled ethnic pockets of France.</p>
        <p>In 2005, he vowed to clean out young troublemakers from one Paris suburb with a Karcher, the brand name of a high-powered hose used to wash off graffiti, and also pledged to rid poor neighborhoods of their ''scum.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy, who is leading in the polls against 11 rivals for the April 22 first-round vote, has kept away from the tough neighborhoods in the suburbs that were consumed by three weeks of violence in late 2005. The Thursday demonstration underscored what some opponents claim: that he is too politically radioactive to venture into such places. Mr. Sarkozy headed straight from the airport to the next stop on his itinerary, an upholstery warehouse in the Lyon suburb of Villeurbanne.</p>
        <p>There, he said that the cancellation of the visit was because of the late arrival of his plane, not the protest. He suggested that the protest had been staged by left-wing activists.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sarkozy has not fulfilled a promise to return to Argenteuil, where he used the term ''scum'' and was pelted with bottles and rocks in 2005. A planned campaign trip was canceled after the police found gasoline bombs in an apartment complex.</p>
        <p>In the election five years ago, popular anxiety about crime and security issues helped propel Jean-Marie Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, into second place in the first round of the election.</p>
        <p>This time, the ''suburb problem'' is a volatile factor. Voter registration in ethnic neighborhoods -- as in parts of the rest of France -- has increased significantly, but there is no reliable data on whether and how voters will vote.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Marine Le Pen, Mr. Le Pen's daughter, who directs his presidential campaign, visited the Paris suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, one of the most violent suburbs during the unrest in 2005.</p>
        <p>Her strategy over the past few years has been to soften the image of her father. He is campaigning on an anti-immigrant, protectionist France-for-the-French platform, but at the same time is courting the vote of second- and third-generation immigrants.</p>
        <p>''I don't find it astonishing at all that French of foreign origin join us,'' she said, adding that ''they will benefit'' like all other French people from the plan to put French citizens first.</p>
        <p>About 15 protesters tried to disrupt her visit, shouting ''F like Fascist, N like Nazi.'' After a brief scuffle, the protesters dispersed.</p>
        <p>The issue of security was brought to the forefront of the presidential campaign last week after an eight-hour standoff between protesters and the police at the Métro station at the Gare du Nord in Paris.</p>
        <p>Ségolène Royal, the Socialist candidate, accused Mr. Sarkozy of using repressive measures in tackling crime and allowing the problems of the suburbs to worsen as interior minister.</p>
        <p>François Bayrou, the candidate of the tiny Union for French Democracy Party, which he heads, has also seized on Mr. Sarkozy's vulnerability. In a recent interview with the popular daily Le Parisien, he said of Mr. Sarkozy, ''Five years in the Interior Ministry, and he can no longer enter parts of the French suburbs.''</p>
        <p>In another development, Azouz Begag, the minister for equal opportunities and an outspoken critic of Mr. Sarkozy, resigned Thursday.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin said in a statement that Mr. Begag had stepped down ''to be able to speak freely again.'' Mr. Begag, who is of Algerian origin, has endorsed Mr. Bayrou for president.</p>

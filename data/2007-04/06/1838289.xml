      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Neil Bartlett's adaptation of ''Oliver Twist,'' presented by the Theater for a New Audience, must easily be among the most competently acted productions on or Off Broadway at the moment. Carson Elrod moves fluidly between his dual roles as the story's wry narrator and the Artful Dodger. Ned Eisenberg gives us a Fagin smarmy, tortured and mesmerizing. As Rose Brownlow, Elizabeth Jasicki exquisitely captures the fragility born of supreme goodness.</p>
        <p>And yet for all that summoning of talent, the play, directed by Mr. Bartlett at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College, and produced in association with the American Repertory and Berkeley Repertory Theaters, remains a cold, detached affair that fails to send the emotional chill it would hope to impose.</p>

        <p>Neil Bartlett's adaptation of ''Oliver Twist,'' presented by the Theater for a New Audience, must easily be among the most competently acted productions on or Off Broadway at the moment. Carson Elrod moves fluidly between his dual roles as the story's wry narrator and the Artful Dodger. Ned Eisenberg gives us a Fagin smarmy, tortured and mesmerizing. As Rose Brownlow, Elizabeth Jasicki exquisitely captures the fragility born of supreme goodness.</p>
        <p>And yet for all that summoning of talent, the play, directed by Mr. Bartlett at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College, and produced in association with the American Repertory and Berkeley Repertory Theaters, remains a cold, detached affair that fails to send the emotional chill it would hope to impose.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett's goal is noble. He has sought to return Dickens's story -- of an orphan boy lost to Victorian miseries -- back to the grim origins for which it was known before those cheerfully sanitizing musical variations. Nearly all of Mr. Bartlett's dialogue comes from the original text. The set, essentially a bleak box, pays tribute to trinkets inspired by the Victorian era's ''penny dreadfuls,'' the lurid pulp fiction that gave rise to toys which revealed various scenes of horror.</p>
        <p>The world Mr. Bartlett creates, in perfectly framed vignettes, looks harrowing and sounds so, but it leaves you sorrowful for no particular character or circumstance, impervious to the matters of child exploitation, identity, poverty, broken families or any of the novel's binding obsessions. Contributing to this absence of feeling is a lighting design that illuminates the actors from below. The effect is to have them looking like specimens to be observed in a vitrine. And it hardly helps that at various points the actors telegraph the story's plot points and themes in a sobering, clerical a capella.</p>
        <p>''Oliver Twist'' has been performed onstage since before Dickens even completed the novel. And to revive it now neither with much sentiment nor any thought to its potential for current social or political relevance seems a bit like offering La Bohème without the tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett has at once worked very hard and not hard enough. He has labored to avoid ''Oliver Twist's'' melodrama and he has lost its poignancy and soul.</p>
        <p>''Oliver Twist'' continues through April 15 at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College, 899 Tenth Avenue at 58th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.</p>

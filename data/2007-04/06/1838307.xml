        <p>Re ''Iran Sets Free 15 Britons Seized at Sea in March'' (front page, April 5):</p>
        <p>While our primary emotion is relief and happiness for the freed British hostages, we must not lose sight of the grave concerns about Iran that have been revived through its perpetration of this outrageous incident.</p>
        <p>The capture of the British sailors and marines provided fresh evidence that Iran is an unpredictable and dangerous rogue regime that acts in contravention to international norms of civilization. At a time when Iran should want to demonstrate that it has the ability to be a responsible member of the community of nations, it has acted in a manner that demonstrates the opposite.</p>
        <p>There are no easy answers in seeking to deal with and contain Iran, but it is clear that it is going to remain a thorn in the side of enlightened people and the nations of the world for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>Oren M. Spiegler  Upper Saint Clair, Pa., April 5, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The peaceful settlement of the Iranian capture of 15 British sailors and marines in the disputed waters just north of the Persian Gulf provides evidence of how Iran is saying it wants to be treated by the international community.</p>
        <p>If the international community sits down and negotiates with Iran, the country will respond in kind.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the United States should learn a lesson from this most recent experience and view it as a first step toward negotiating with Iran on a variety of issues, including security in Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian issue and Iran's nuclear program.</p>
        <p>Carah Ong  Washington, April 5, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is an Iran policy analyst at the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''What We Can Learn From Britain About Iran'' (Op-Ed, April 5), Vali Nasr and Ray Takeyh arrive at some curious conclusions regarding America's relations with Iran.</p>
        <p>They do not acknowledge the fact that the British naval crisis was precipitated by Iran. Nor do they take note that a unanimous Security Council voted to impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. And there's no mention of the weapons and support that the United States says Iran is giving to the Shiite insurgents in Iraq that have been used to kill American soldiers.</p>
        <p>While there is no doubt that American diplomacy needs to be more robust and engaging, how can Mr. Nasr and Mr. Takeyh suggest that the responsibility for the antagonistic relations between Iran and the rest of the world can be laid at the feet of America's ''policy of coercion'' without mention of these critical facts?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Iran, the Vicious Victim,'' by Max Hastings (Op-Ed, March 30):</p>
        <p>The Mennonite Central Committee has a 17-year history of working in Iran. In February, it helped lead a delegation of American religious leaders to Iran, where the group met with ordinary Iranians and with religious and political leaders, including the current and former presidents. Several things stood out:</p>
        <p>The Iranian government is not monolithic. Many Iranian officials and citizens would welcome mutually respectful dialogue with the United States. American threats and pressure undermine their efforts.</p>
        <p>The United States and Iran share strategic interests. Both want a stable Iraq. Both want to limit the influence of Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Both are concerned about the illicit drug flow from Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Iran's declared policy is that it is seeking nuclear energy for peaceful purposes only. While analysts can speculate about Iran's true intent, this much is clear: talking directly with Iran would place the United States in a much better position to address Iran's nuclear program and a range of other concerns.</p>

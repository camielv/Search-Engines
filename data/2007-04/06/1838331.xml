        <p>An unusual law that shapes the oversight of German companies is again being re-examined after corruption scandals at Siemens and Volkswagen, even as more companies are finding ways to skirt it.</p>
        <p>Under German law, companies are required to give as many as half of their supervisory board seats to labor representatives. That increasingly appears to lead to conflicts of interest and even to cases of bribery in corporate Germany, because executives need a supervisory board's support to keep their jobs and carry out strategy.</p>
        <p>At Siemens, a top executive was arrested last week and accused of funneling 34 million euros ($45.3 million) to the coffers of a labor union represented on the board, seeking to gain favor.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors call the case Amigo, as a way of emphasizing the supposed alliance between management and labor.</p>
        <p>At Volkswagen, a senior executive was fined more than $700,000 in January for his role in a scandal that involved bribing worker representatives on the supervisory board with money, trips and prostitutes.</p>
        <p>Nowhere else in Europe do the ties between labor and management seem so close. Germany requires a company with more than 2,000 employees to grant half its board seats to labor. Austria and Luxembourg require one-third representation. Fourteen of the 27 members of the European Union have no such requirements.</p>
        <p>Advocates of the German system, known as co-determination, say that the consensus-driven corporate culture helped the country emerge from the devastating effects of hyperinflation and two world wars to become an economic powerhouse.</p>
        <p>But its critics say that the law is outmoded and hampers German competitiveness against global rivals.</p>
        <p>Some German companies are finding ways to get around the law, by incorporating abroad or by changing their legal status in Germany.</p>
        <p>In recent editorials, a national daily, Die Welt, called the co-determination law ''a license to bribe.'' Thomas Straubhaar, director of the Hamburg Institute of International Economics, said he hoped ''that Siemens and Volkswagen remain exceptions.''</p>
        <p>''But on the other hand,'' he said, ''the system is susceptible to collusion and corruption.''</p>
        <p>For example, at Deutsche Bahn, the rail system, the chief executive, Hartmut Mehdorn, contributes corporate funds to an external lobbying group headed by a labor representative, Norbert Hansen, who is the vice chairman of the company's supervisory board.</p>
        <p>The lobby, Allianz Pro Schiene (roughly the Alliance for Rail), describes itself as a group working to promote environmentally friendly and safe transport. A spokesman confirmed the contribution, but declined to give the amount. The newsmagazine Der Spiegel put it at 130,000 euros ($173,000) a year.</p>
        <p>At Deutsche Post World Net, the German postal company and operator of DHL express delivery service, 530 employees are acting as full-time labor representatives, often with company cars and private secretaries. The company has more than 500,000 workers and is one of the world's largest employers.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Deutsche Post, Dirk Klasen, said its decentralized structure justified more labor representatives.</p>
        <p>''It is not a luxury job,'' he said. ''It is more important that we could get a good atmosphere of open discussions.''</p>
        <p>In another episode widely reported in German news media, Deutsche Post's chief executive, Klaus Zumwinkel, in his role as head of the supervisory board of Deutsche Telekom, backed Regine Büttner last year to become the new chief of personnel at the former phone monopoly. The endorsement was criticized because she was the wife of Rolf Büttner, then vice chairman of the supervisory board and a labor representative at Deutsche Post. Ms. Büttner withdrew her candidacy under pressure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klasen, the Deutsche Post spokesman, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Manuel R. Theisen, a professor at the University of Munich, said notable conflicts of interest arise when the head of a company's worker council also sits on the supervisory board. Such is the case at businesses including the automaker DaimlerChrysler.</p>
        <p>Erich Klemm, vice chairman of the supervisory board, joined Daimler as a mechanic at 16. He has been on the board since 1988, first when it was Daimler-Benz and, after the 1998 merger, at DaimlerChrysler.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klemm has great power at the company, Professor Theisen said, adding that people like him ''are insiders.''</p>
        <p>''As such, they can stomp very hard on the feet of management,'' he said, ''even before a meeting of the supervisory board occurs.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler could not be reached for comment on Thursday.</p>
        <p>As a way to get around the co-determination policy, some companies say they are under pressure to incorporate in other countries or to change their legal structure to Societas Europae, or in the shorthand of corporate law, S.E. The form is similar to Sociedad Anónima (S.A.) in Spain and Latin America, Aktiengesellschaft (A.G.) in Germany, and Inc. in the United States, and was created by the European Union in 2004 to help standardize corporate governance across borders.</p>
        <p>It also gives companies more flexibility on the question of board labor representation. At a shareholders' meeting in Berlin on Wednesday, Henning Gebhardt, a fund manager at DWS Investment, called on DaimlerChrysler to convert to an S.E.</p>
        <p>The German model of co-determination, he said, ''has unfortunately not been effective in practice.''</p>
        <p>The big insurer Allianz became an S.E. last year. A chemical company, BASF, and Fresenius, a big medical company, have announced plans to do so as well.</p>
        <p>Air Berlin, by contrast, became a British public limited company, or P.L.C., when it was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange last year. In the middle of a road show to sell its shares, the chief executive, Joachim Hunold, said the German supervisory board system was ''no longer competitive internationally.''</p>
        <p>''There are always cases in which companies always must compromise, as was the case with Volkswagen,'' he told the Berlin newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. A spokeswoman confirmed his comments.</p>
        <p>The Confederation of German Employers' Associations, an umbrella group that lobbies on behalf of companies, plans to take up an overhaul of the co-determination law before the next national elections, according to Thomas Prinz, a member of the group's legal department.</p>
        <p>''We will continue our fight to make Germany more competitive,'' he said.</p>

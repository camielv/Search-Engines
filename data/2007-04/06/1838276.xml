        <p>Chopin dedicated his Opus 10 Études to Franz Liszt, admitting that his colleague could better handle their technical demands. But both composer-pianists would certainly be impressed by the number of young pianists today who -- possibly because they ignored Chopin's warning not to practice more than three hours daily -- can toss off those same pieces with apparent ease.</p>
        <p>But the most intimate music is often the most revealing. One of the loveliest moments in the New York debut at Weill Recital Hall on Wednesday of Alexej Gorlatch, a remarkably talented 19-year-old Ukrainian pianist, came late in the program, during Chopin's yearning Étude Opus 10, No. 3, which Mr. Gorlatch played with finesse and maturity that belied his youth.</p>

        <p>Chopin dedicated his Opus 10 Études to Franz Liszt, admitting that his colleague could better handle their technical demands. But both composer-pianists would certainly be impressed by the number of young pianists today who -- possibly because they ignored Chopin's warning not to practice more than three hours daily -- can toss off those same pieces with apparent ease.</p>
        <p>But the most intimate music is often the most revealing. One of the loveliest moments in the New York debut at Weill Recital Hall on Wednesday of Alexej Gorlatch, a remarkably talented 19-year-old Ukrainian pianist, came late in the program, during Chopin's yearning Étude Opus 10, No. 3, which Mr. Gorlatch played with finesse and maturity that belied his youth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorlatch, who studies at the University of Music and Theater in Hanover, Germany, was presented as the winner of the 2006 Hamamatsu International Piano Competition in Japan, one of several competitions he has already won.</p>
        <p>His thoughtfully chosen program started out on a dreamy note with Schumann's ''Fantasiestücke'' (Op. 12). Some pianists walk on stage and plunge right in, but Mr. Gorlatch, who has a serious demeanor, took his time before beginning with the quietly nocturnal ''Des Abends,'' successfully navigating the moods and character of Schumann's miniatures.</p>
        <p>He continued the dreamy ambience of the Schumann pieces by following with Beethoven's Sonata No. 28 (Op. 101). He sensitively explored the gentle musings of the nostalgic first movement, which begins as if the composer was midway through a train of thought. Like the Schumann this is music of many moods, with the lyrical opening followed by a lively, harmonically colorful and contrapuntal march.</p>
        <p>After intermission Mr. Gorlatch offered a winning performance of Minako Tokuyama's appealing ''Music Nara for Piano,'' commissioned for the Hamamatsu competition. This whimsical work evokes the mystique of Japan's ancient capital with quiet lyricism, impressionistic bursts of color and an energetic, almost jazzy outburst.</p>
        <p>With Chopin's Op. 10 Études, which concluded the evening, Mr. Gorlatch demonstrated his prizewinning technique while remaining expressive and musical. There was more Chopin as an encore: a heartfelt, dignified and soulful performance of the Polonaise in A flat (Op. 53).</p>

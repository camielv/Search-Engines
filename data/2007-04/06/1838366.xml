        <p>Jon S.

        <p>Jon S. Corzine, the governor of New Jersey, has agreed to let two outside ethics advisers review whether his former romantic relationship with the head of a leading state workers' union local influenced recent contract negotiations with the union, the governor's spokesman said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The decision to request an independent review followed calls by Steven Lonegan, a Republican who is the mayor of Bogota, N.J., and others for the governor to release more information about his relationship with Carla Katz, the union leader.</p>
        <p>The advisers constitute a state board that makes determinations on the governor's conduct. They are Daniel J. O'Hern Sr., a retired State Supreme Court justice and former counsel to Gov. Brendan Byrne, a Democrat; and John J. Farmer Jr., a former state attorney general under Gov. Christie Whitman, a Republican.</p>
        <p>Anthony Coley, Governor Corzine's spokesman, told The Associated Press, ''To put to rest any questions the public may have, we have asked the governor's Ethics Advisory Panel for their review and advice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coley said in an interview that the advisers were asked to review the matter on Monday afternoon. Mr. Coley said the review was likely to take at least a week.</p>
        <p>In February, the state negotiated a new contract with state workers that would give them a 13 percent pay increase over four years but would require them for the first time to pay a share of health care premiums.</p>
        <p>The workers were set to vote last month on whether to approve the contract, but the vote was delayed until next Wednesday after two of seven local presidents for the union, the Communications Workers of America, opposed the contract.</p>
        <p>One of the two dissident leaders is Ms. Katz, president of Local 1034 and a former companion of the governor. She argued the union gave away too much to the state.</p>
        <p>Governor Corzine has acknowledged that in 2004, when he was a United States senator, he forgave a loan in the amount of $470,000, the value of a mortgage, that he had given Ms. Katz in 2003 when the two were dating.</p>
        <p>Since then, the relationship, which ended in 2004, has come under increased scrutiny.</p>
        <p>The referral of the matter to the state advisory board followed the governor's rebuff of a request by The Associated Press for documents.</p>
        <p>The A.P. said yesterday that it had been advised by Governor Corzine's counsel's office that ''neither documents nor correspondence discussing state business exist between Corzine and his former girlfriend, Carla Katz.''</p>
        <p>The A.P. said it asked for copies of any such documents in a request filed last week under the state's Open Public Records Act.</p>
        <p>But the agency said the governor's office denied The A.P.'s request for copies of any documents.</p>

        <p>ZELL GETS A VETO AT TRIBUNE -- The Tribune Company disclosed new details of its plan to go private in a deal engineered by the real estate tycoon Samuel Zell. Although Mr. Zell will control a minority of the board, he will have the right to veto any major transactions. [C1.]</p>
        <p>BITTER RIVALRY GOES TO COURT -- A federal trial is about to begin over the contention that Splenda, the artificial sweetener, misleads consumers when it says it is made from sugar and is natural. The plaintiff? Splenda's rival, Equal. [C1.]</p>
        <p>PLEA FROM CORPORATE OFFICES -- Many executives of large companies are starting to call for a national approach to fixing health care, warning that an employer-subsidized health system is unsustainable. [C1.]</p>
        <p>FEDERAL OFFICIAL HELD STOCK -- A senior official at the federal Education Department sold more than $100,000 in shares in a student loan company even as he was helping oversee lenders in the federal student loan program. [A1.]</p>

        <p>A WINEMAKER'S RISING PROFIT -- Constellation Brands, the world's biggest winemaker, said its quarterly profit grew 26 percent as strong wine sales in the United States helped offset heightened competition in Britain and a drop in sales of imported beer. Earnings after paying preferred dividends climbed to $70.2 million, or 29 cents a share, from $55.8 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. [C2.]</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Tennessee attorney general decided on Thursday to scuttle a settlement over Fisk University's plan to sell a Georgia O'Keeffe painting after purchase offers dwarfed earlier estimates of its worth.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Robert E. Cooper Jr. said he could not approve Fisk's sale of the painting, ''Radiator Building-Night, New York,'' to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, N.M., for $7 million because recent offers to buy it suggested it could be worth $20 million or more.</p>
        <p>''The purchase price of $7 million is simply too much of a discount,'' Mr. Cooper said.</p>
        <p>Unless another settlement is reached, the case will go to trial in July to decide whether Fisk can sell the O'Keeffe painting and a second one by Marsden Hartley, both from its Stieglitz Collection.</p>
        <p>Fisk's president, Hazel O'Leary, said she was not surprised by Mr. Cooper's decision, given the high purchase offers and opinions from art experts about the painting's value. Saul Cohen, president of the museum's board, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The dispute centers on whether Fisk remains bound by its original agreement to keep the collection intact, but the case is also interwoven with nettlesome questions of art stewardship, Fisk's financial failings and O'Keeffe's intentions.</p>
        <p>O'Keeffe, the widow of the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, donated her ''Radiator Building'' and ''Painting No. 3'' by Hartley in 1949, along with 99 other pieces, including works by Picasso, Renoir and Cezanne.</p>
        <p>In late 2005, Ms. O'Leary announced plans to seek court approval to sell the two paintings to pay for the collection's upkeep and to shore up Fisk's diminished endowment. The attorney general has jurisdiction because his office supervises charitable gifts in the state.</p>
        <p>The museum intervened, arguing that Fisk did not have the right to sell the works. In February, the two sides reached the settlement under which the museum would buy ''Radiator Building.'' In return, the museum agreed not to oppose the sale of the Hartley painting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper approved the agreement, but only if Fisk first sought out benefactors to help ease its financial problems and keep the paintings on campus.</p>
        <p>Fisk invited such donations, but none materialized. The university did, however, receive offers to buy the O'Keeffe painting outright, including one for $20 million and two for $25 million.</p>

        <p>Many children easily master their A B C's. But even adults can have trouble understanding their A's, T's, C's and G's. In biology A, T, C and G stand for adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine, the four bases that are the chemical building blocks of DNA and the foundation of life. But while their action is complex, appreciating their basic function doesn't require an advanced degree. According to ''Genome: The Secret of How Life Works,'' a touring exhibition at the New York Hall of Science in Queens, the easiest teaching aids are in your kitchen. ''We like to use a recipe analogy, so think of the genome as the cookbook of life,'' Thomas G. Turi, a genomic scientist with Pfizer, said recently as he led a tour of the show, which Pfizer financed. ''The chromosomes might be a chapter, and the genes individual recipes.'' These comparisons infuse several displays in the 5,000-square-foot exhibition, including a whimsical assembly line, the Cookie Factory, which might have been created by a geneticist with Willy Wonka sensibilities. Here a cell's nucleus is a home office, which sends out recipes for proteins to the cell's ribosomes, or factories. But dessert isn't the only metaphor. Proteins are likened to origami -- how they're shaped determines their function -- and principles of heredity are illustrated by a slot machine. Pull the lever and see how hypothetical genes might line up for traits like dimples. Fortunately, the exhibition is more than clever simplification. While a first grader can turn a wheel to compress a DNA model into a double helix, older children and adults can absorb more sophisticated science via filmed interviews, text panels and computer displays. Some information is fascinating, some humbling. What a piece of work is man -- and yet 50 percent of our genes are the same as a banana's. (Through May 6 at the New York Hall of Science, 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, 718-699-0005, nyscience.org. Free with admission: $11; $8 for ages 2 through 17, students and 62+; under 2, free. Free to all Fridays from 2 to 5 p.m. and Sundays from 10 to 11 a.m.)</p>

        <p>It's been a busy couple of months for the choreographer Larry Keigwin, but luckily he seems to function on a ridiculously high energy level. He finishes up Gender Benders, the latest installment of Keigwin Kabaret, tomorrow at Symphony Space. Then on Thursday he heads downtown to the Skirball Center, where Keigwin and Company will present a new commissioned work, ''Bolero NYC,'' as part of a split bill with Chris Elam's Misnomer Dance Theater, which is also presenting a premiere. While the provocative burlesque spectacles that can unfold at Keigwin Kabaret (with Julian Barnett, above) are in no need of young-audience outreach, the Skirball evening is specifically aimed at drawing a youthful crowd, and will include postperformance dance parties with a live D.J. In an e-mail invitation, Mr. Keigwin described the Kabaret as a bachelor party (''bawdy and restless''). His Skirball show, of course, is the wedding, and for the premiere of ''Bolero NYC,'' he has invited a diverse guest list, bringing on dozens of nonprofessional dancers to augment his company's performance. Known for his interest in capturing the peculiarities of contemporary life, often in small-scale, portraitlike works, Mr. Keigwin has now turned his attention to the Big Apple. Here's hoping it's a good match, made in some no doubt frenetic heaven. (Keigwin Kabaret runs through tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $21 to $25. Keigwin and Company performs April 12 and 14 at 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, 212-279-4200, www.skirballcenter.nyu.edu; $20 to $30)</p>

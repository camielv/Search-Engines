      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>BARNYARD EASTER EGG HUNT (Tomorrow) Children will not only find eggs, but also toss them and roll them (and maybe break them, but that's O.K.) in this annual event in the orchard of the Queens County Farm Museum. Visiting the farm animals and taking a hayride are part of the fun. From noon to 4 p.m., 73-50 Little Neck Parkway, Floral Park, (718) 347-3276; $4.</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN CHILDREN'S MUSEUM (Today through Sunday) The museum offers many ways to enjoy spring. Today, tomorrow and Sunday, from 11 a.m. to noon, is ''Blooming Babies Weekend,'' in which the littlest visitors (under 3) can examine and build nests. Tomorrow, from noon to 1 p.m. in ''Think Outside the Box,'' children over 6 will explore and create other containers. And on Sunday, from noon to 2 p.m., all can celebrate National Poetry Month with a performer from Def Poetry Jam. After listening to the professional verses, visitors will create their own. At 145 Brooklyn Avenue, at St. Mark's Avenue, Crown Heights, (718) 735-4400, brooklynkids.org. Free with admission: $5; free for members and on Saturdays and Sundays before noon.</p>
        <p>'BUBBLEMANIA: SCIENCE, ART &amp; COMEDY!' (Today through Sunday) Casey Carle is forever blowing bubbles, but his are more extraordinary than most: six-foot spheres, cube bubbles, even a bubble spacecraft. He will show off the fun (and the physics) of his creations in shows at 1, 2 and 3 p.m. at the New York Hall of Science, 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 699-0005, nyscience.org. Free with admission: $11; $8 for ages 2 through 17, students and 62+; free for under 2. Free to all Fridays from 2 to 5 p.m. and Sundays from 10 to 11 a.m.</p>
        <p>CHILDREN'S THEATER COMPANY (Tomorrow) These young performers explore tolerance themes in short musicals. ''Providence: The Story of Roger Williams'' focuses on the Rhode Island Colony founder who befriended the Narragansett Indians, while ''Farmer Rabbit's Fiesta'' deals with a selfish animal. At 4:30 p.m., Bahai Unity Center, 53 East 11th Street, East Village; $12. Reservations required: (212) 633-6629.</p>
        <p>'CHOCOLATE AND VANILLA ADVENTURES' (Today through Sunday) This is the kind of exploring anyone can do: a discovery of the wonderful plants that give us chocolate and vanilla at the New York Botanical Garden. Children will examine vanilla beans and vanilla orchids and chocolate seeds and spices, and keep a field journal. And, yes, tasting is involved. Today from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. and tomorrow and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the Everett Children's Adventure Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. Grounds admission: $6; $3 for 65+; $2 for students; $1 for 2 through 12. Admission to Everett garden: $3; $1 for 2 through 12.</p>
        <p>'EASTER EGGS: A FAMILY EGGSTRAVAGANZA' (Tomorrow) Children can create a natural-looking nest of twigs, feathers and clay, and create some unnatural -- but pretty -- eggs for it, with glitter, glue and paint. From 10 a.m. to noon at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights; $5 a child. Participants are to take two hard-boiled eggs. Reservations: (212) 932-7347.</p>
        <p>'THE GAME BOY' (Today through Sunday) This new musical from Vital Children's Theater is about a boy, Chase, who is so wrapped up in his favorite video game that he starts to neglect the real world. Sound familiar? After today's show, children can take part in a workshop in which they create a video-game character and an adventure. (Through April 22.) Today at 1 p.m., and tomorrow and Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212) 352-3101. Show, $18; workshop, $14.</p>
        <p>'GO, DIEGO, GO LIVE!: THE GREAT JAGUAR RESCUE' (Today through Thursday) Diego, cousin of the 7-year-old title character of Nickelodeon's preschool show ''Dora the Explorer,'' joins her onstage in an adventure in which they seek to retrieve Baby Jaguar's growl from those mischievous monkeys, the Bobos. Today at 11 a.m.; tomorrow and Sunday at 11 a.m. and 2 and 5 p.m.; Thursday at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. (Through April 15.) At Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $29 to $79.</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF THE MOVING IMAGE (Today, Monday and Tuesday) How do authors' word pictures become moving pictures? The museum invites children to learn the process in a 1 p.m. workshop in which they will draw a scene from E. B. White's ''Charlotte's Web'' and then see it as it was rendered in two film adaptations. At 2 p.m. they can attend a full screening of the most recent ''Charlotte's Web'' movie, starring Dakota Fanning. At 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us. Free with admission: $10; $7.50 for 65+ and students; $5 for 5 through 18; under 5, free.</p>
        <p>'PINKALICIOUS' (Today through Sunday) Sometimes being in the pink can be too much of a good thing, as the pink-obsessed title character learns in this musical from Vital Children's Theater, which Elizabeth and Victoria Kann adapted from their children's book. A ''Cook Pink'' workshop after today's show will include making pink mini-volcanoes and cupcakes. (Through April 29.) At noon, SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, near Varick Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555, sohoplayhouse.com. Show, $25 (reservations required); workshop, $20.</p>
        <p>'THE SEDER SURPRISE!'  (Sunday) The Hebrew word seder means order, referring to the ritual feast that begins Passover. In the Schwartz household, however, the atmosphere is more like disorder. Children will meet the family, who aren't typical Jews (they look more like ''Sesame Street'' monsters), when the puppeteer Len Levitt presents this show at the Jewish Museum. At 2 p.m., 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. Tickets: $15; $10 for under 12; $12 and $8 for family-level members.</p>
        <p>SHABBAT AND PASSOVER FUN (Tomorrow) Four important questions are asked and answered at every Passover seder. But here that dialogue is unusual: it's danced. The Risa Jarslow Dance Company will perform this interactive piece at 2:30 p.m., and after, at 3:45, families can join a workshop to create their own Passover dances. At the J. C. C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (646) 505-5708. Free.</p>
        <p>SPRING EXTRAVAGANZA (Tomorrow) Pink eggs, blue eggs, green eggs (but no ham) will be found throughout selected city parks in a celebration that includes egg hunts, egg dyeing, carnival games and arts and crafts. Highlights include the ''Spring Fling Egg Hunt'' from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Brooklyn Bridge Park (brooklynbridgepark.org), and ''Egg-O-Rama'' at 1 p.m. at the Prospect Park Audubon Center, with an egg hunt and a bunny-hop race (prospectpark.org). Full schedule and all locations: nyc.govparks.org.</p>
        <p>THEATRESPORTS (Tomorrow) It may involve actors, but it's still an athletic event: the members of Freestyle Repertory Theater, an improv troupe, break up into two teams and perform skits based on suggestions from the audience. Children attending not only vote on the outcome but also participate onstage. At 11 a.m., Gallery Players, 199 14th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 595-0547, galleryplayers.com. Admission is, literally, peanuts: show up with one and get in free.</p>

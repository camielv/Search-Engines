        <p>New Jersey Transit service on the Montclair-Boonton Line was suspended for more than seven hours during the morning rush yesterday after a hydrant broke, flooding the tracks, the agency said. Service was suspended on the line around 5:45 a.m., said Penny Bassett-Hackett, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit, after more than a foot of water rose over the tracks near the Watsessing station, near Montclair State University. A delivery truck crashed into the hydrant in the parking lot of a nearby Home Depot store. Pumps were brought in to remove the water and commuters were diverted to bus and Newark PATH lines. Service was restored about 1 p.m., Ms. Bassett-Hackett said.</p>

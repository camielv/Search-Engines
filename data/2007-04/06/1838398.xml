        <p>The Muse, the Fugitive and the Frequency  Bellwether  134 10th Avenue, at 18th Street, Chelsea  Through April 14</p>
        <p>Subtlety is a hallmark of Tanyth Berkeley's work. Her first solo show of photographs featured women who hovered between odd beauty and homeliness and induced a thrilling state of anxiety by forcing you to question your own definitions of beauty.</p>
        <p>In her second solo outing Ms. Berkeley falters somewhat. She hits the mark in a back-room installation of images featuring her favorite sitters, appropriately titled ''The Muse,'' which explores the intersections between appearance, identity and creativity. At other times she is too restrained. ''The Frequency,'' a lineup of 160 snapshots of people in Times Square with mildly funky hairdos, over-plucked eyebrows and ''interesting'' wardrobe choices, suggests the obvious -- there's a fine line between individuality and freakiness -- but doesn't develop this further. A video of extroverted roller skaters dancing to music in Central Park is also more of a sketch than a realized work.</p>
        <p>''The Fugitive,'' a series of photographs devoted to transgendered women, suffers the opposite problem. Which attributes are needed to pass as a woman is, like the beauty conundrum, a fascinating issue. Yet Ms. Berkeley veers dangerously into caricature by posing her subjects with flowers, highlighting their garish, makeshift ''femininity.''</p>
        <p>Mostly, this show is overloaded with work. (Another series of 21 photographs documenting amateurish urban wall murals hangs in the hallway.) Ms. Berkeley is currently working in many directions, but we don't need a progress report on them all. In her previous show the photographs of women and a few videos were enough to convince viewers of her acuity and intrepidness.</p>

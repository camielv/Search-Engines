        <p>AN irate symphony in coordinated silver -- the hair, the beard, the tie -- James J.

        <p>AN irate symphony in coordinated silver -- the hair, the beard, the tie -- James J. Culleton, the Bronx-raised former prosecutor hired to defend Detective Michael Oliver, the New York City police officer who has come under scrutiny, and indictment, for blasting 31 shots in the confrontation that killed groom-to-be Sean Bell, is exploiting an invitation to vent.</p>
        <p>Criminal defense lawyer as victim is a tough act to pull off, but Mr. Culleton, 58, is game to try it on for size. And he seems confident, in his well-upholstered comfort zone at Culleton, Marinaccio &amp; Foglia, where golf knickknacks and a ceramic leprechaun jazz up his desk and a courtroom artist's rendering of his successful defense of Officer Richard Murphy in the Amadou Diallo case decorates the wall, that it will fit like his tailored suit.</p>
        <p>''I like to stand up and argue,'' he says about a career path he selected in eighth grade, with Clarence Darrow and Atticus Finch as role models, despite the fact that no one in his family had gone to college, much less graduated from Fordham University School of Law.</p>
        <p>Since entering private practice in 1985, he has represented clients like Vincent (the Chin) Gigante, the reputed Mafia boss and pajama aficionado, and Salvatore Candela, acquitted in 1990 of heroin smuggling in one of the ''Pizza Connection'' cases. (Mr. Culleton points, without embarrassment, to a fancy gold clock that proclaims him the world's best lawyer, a gift from Mr. Candela.) Better yet, he says, is his thank-you from Officer Murphy, who joined the Fire Department after his acquittal: he named his son James.</p>
        <p>Mr. Culleton is eager to get Detective Oliver in front of a jury. ''There are cases that scream out for a defense lawyer to put his client on the stand, and this is one of them,'' he says. But he frets about assembling a panel of impartial jurors.</p>
        <p>''I'm not looking to try this case in the newspapers, but the pretrial publicity seems to be surpassing even what we had in Diallo, and it all seems to be focused on my client,'' he says. ''All it's really doing is poisoning a potential jury pool. I can understand why people might be startled at the 31 shots, but where he eats dinner, what he looked like when he was 15, whether he bought a condo in Jersey near his mother: that's irrelevant to the facts of this case. We're behind the eight ball before we even begin.''</p>
        <p>GOOD thing Mr. Culleton, who was an assistant Bronx district attorney in Mario Merola's office from 1973 to 1985, has a special philosophy about the merits of police officers as clients: ''I think they're easy to defend, because they're not criminals.'' Not as a rule. ''I don't think there's a lawyer alive who could say 'I only represent innocent people.' That would be a stretch.'' But Detective Oliver? ''Innocent.''</p>
        <p>''This was a tragedy, a tragic mistake was made, but there was no crime committed,'' he adds. ''What you had in Diallo and in this case is a shooting where the officers believed deadly physical force was being, or was about to be, used against them. Everyone is fixated on the number of shots my client fired, but it only took 10 seconds: the thing was over before it began. If an officer believes deadly force is being used, he is justified in using deadly force in return. It doesn't matter how many times he shoots. He is supposed to shoot until the threat is eliminated.''</p>
        <p>Seated before a journalistic audience of two, one with a camera that captures the lawyer's Shakespearean-caliber gesticulations (he says he tends to ''prance'' and ''jump around'' a lot in court), the other asking him questions about his client's apparent disinclination to adopt a low profile immediately after his indictment -- Detective Oliver is reportedly a serious party animal and also a hothead who in 1995, according to The Daily News, manhandled a livery cabbie during a routine arrest in East Harlem, prompting a $10,000 settlement by the city -- vent Mr. Culleton does.</p>
        <p>He vents against the grand jury that indicted his client on manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment charges despite his voluntary and, in Mr. Culleton's opinion, contrite testimony. (That only three of the five officers who fired their guns were indicted also strikes him as inconsistent.)</p>
        <p>He vents against a cadre of social activists trying to put a racial spin on the chain of events that occurred outside Club Kalua, where the shooting took place.</p>
        <p>And, most vehemently, he vents against a smear campaign (his words for it) masquerading as investigative journalism that appeared recently in The New York Post and The Daily News. The News, adding insult to injury, misspelled his surname on Sunday and, according to him, quoted him out of context. He describes the articles' thrust as ''character assassination of my client for the purpose of selling newspapers.''</p>
        <p>He said neither he nor his client was aware of a reported $10,000 settlement in the cabbie incident, but he dismissed it as a nuisance suit. He reiterated that in 600 career arrests, Detective Oliver had never fired his weapon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Culleton, whose next court appearance on behalf of Detective Oliver is scheduled for Wednesday, says he assumes that the case will be tried before a jury but he is uncertain whether, because of the negative publicity, he might request a change of venue. ''The jury's still out on that.'' So to speak.</p>

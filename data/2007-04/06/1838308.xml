        <p>Re ''Mommy and Daddy's Little Life Coach'' (Thursday Styles, April 5): As someone raised by a single parent who asked my advice, and as a single parent now who is struggling not to do so with her own kids, I can tell you that while there are financial consultants and matchmakers available to us in the Yellow Pages or on the Internet, your children have only one mother and one father.</p>

        <p>Re ''Mommy and Daddy's Little Life Coach'' (Thursday Styles, April 5): As someone raised by a single parent who asked my advice, and as a single parent now who is struggling not to do so with her own kids, I can tell you that while there are financial consultants and matchmakers available to us in the Yellow Pages or on the Internet, your children have only one mother and one father.</p>
        <p>My rule of thumb is, if I am asking my child advice for which I would otherwise pay hourly or for which he would have been paid a commission, I've overstepped a boundary. Let our kids be our kids, not our consultants. They have only a brief (and getting briefer) amount of time to be one and not the other.</p>

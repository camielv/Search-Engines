        <p>WHAT -- Condominium-hotel at a large resort.  WHERE -- Paradise Island in the Bahamas.  AMENITIES -- Beach access, a swimming pool and a restaurant, among others.

DETAILS -- This project is part of the third phase of development at Atlantis, a 171-acre, nearly 3,000-room resort on an island connected by a bridge to Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas. A 22-story building just off the beach, it will have 495 units, from studios to two-bedroom suites, that owners may enter in a revenue-sharing rental program. There will be a private lounge for owners, along with the swimming pool and restaurant at the residential building. Another new addition to the resort is a 600-suite hotel, the Cove, that opened last week and offers restaurants, including one by Bobby Flay. The resort's amenities includes a water park, a marine habitat, a casino, a full-service spa and restaurants by Nobu Matsuhisa and Jean-Georges Vongerichten. There are nonstop flights to Nassau from several major American cities, including New York.</p>

CONTACT -- (888) 972-6240 or www.livingranchomirage.com.  DETAILS -- On 40 acres near Palm Springs, Calif., this project will overlook the Coachella Valley from a plateau.

A rental program will be available. All the residences will include balconies or terraces, and many will feature plunge pools, fire pits and outdoor showers.

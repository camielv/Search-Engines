        <p>A prisoner died on Wednesday shortly after he was attacked by three men who were in a holding cell with him at the Bronx County Courthouse, the police said.</p>
        <p>Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, who was asked about the death yesterday at a news conference, said the prisoner was assaulted by men ''who may have suspected him of somehow giving information on them.''</p>
        <p>The man who died was identified by people involved in the investigation as Wilfredo Galindez, 44, of the Bronx. Investigators said Mr. Galindez had health problems, and suffered a seizure of some sort before or during the confrontation with other prisoners. They said it remained unclear yesterday if his death was caused by the seizure or the assault.</p>
        <p>''We know that he was assaulted,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''But we don't know the cause of death.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly said that investigators were talking to all of the people who were in the cell when the assault occurred. Investigators would not say how many people were in the cell at the time, nor would they identify any of the prisoners.</p>
        <p>Investigators said Mr. Galindez had a long record of narcotics arrests and was being held in a large cell on a narcotics charge when he was assaulted shortly before noon on Wednesday. He was taken to Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, where he was pronounced dead at 2 p.m., the police said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the office of the city's medical examiner, which is responsible for determining the cause of death, said it had not done so late yesterday afternoon.</p>

        <p>Re ''Pelosi's Delegation Presses Syrian Leader on Militants'' (news article, April 5):</p>
        <p>How many people, how many commissions and how many experts in international relations have to speak out before the Bush administration changes its view on diplomacy?</p>
        <p>Even former Secretary of State James A. Baker III has stated that we need to talk to Iran and Syria, but the administration still refuses.</p>
        <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has the right idea. We need to maintain a dialogue even with those we may see as our enemies or ''foes.''</p>
        <p>As John F. Kennedy once said, ''To those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.''</p>
        <p>President Bush could learn a lesson by using his history degree.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Pelosi, Warmly Greeted in Syria, Is Criticized by White House'' (news article, April 4):</p>
        <p>Intelligence and reason are finally finding their way to the Middle East, and the feckless Bush administration is seeking to vilify the effort.</p>
        <p>Those are my headlines.</p>
        <p>Jim Hoover  Huntington Beach, Calif.  April 5, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has no business conducting foreign relations policy in Syria. Syria is a state sponsor of terrorism. Its government undermines the interests of the United States.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pelosi and those who accompanied her on this ill-conceived visit should be ridiculed publicly for their behavior.</p>
        <p>These brazen acts by supposedly responsible lawmakers are a travesty and undercut both our government and our people. The American people should not tolerate this kind of behavior.</p>

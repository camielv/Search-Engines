        <p>Jazz tribute albums are often concessionary in nature: the subject dictates a repertory and, in many cases, a style. Not so, though, with ''Gardenias for Lady Day'' (Columbia), a 2003 album by the saxophonist James Carter. In name and spirit it's a valentine to Billie Holiday, yet only half of its chosen tracks can be found in the Holiday discography. One of those, the chilling lynching narrative ''Strange Fruit,'' features a vocal by Miche Braden -- but with a stentorian projection quite unlike her predecessor's. And the anchor of that performance is a bitterly caterwauling catharsis, an enactment of violence through timbre; it's not something one associates with Holiday, except perhaps through the early example of one of her inheritors, Abbey Lincoln. Elsewhere the album is more decorous, with string arrangements and debonair ballad interpretations indirectly suggestive of Holiday's general era. The instrumental palette is prodigious -- Mr. Carter, above, deploys tenor, baritone, soprano, mezzo-soprano, F-mezzo and bass saxophones, along with bass and contrabass clarinets -- and the mood is more nervy than cloying. (Mr. Carter pulled off a similar maneuver in 2000 with ''Chasin' the Gypsy,'' which pursued a modern mirage of the guitarist Django Reinhardt.) Of course the balance will probably tip even further toward the emphatic when Mr. Carter performs the music from ''Gardenias'' for the first time on a New York City stage. Along with Ms. Braden and the Akua Dixon String Ensemble, his group will include some Detroit-based colleagues heard on his 2004 Warner Brothers album ''Live at Baker's Keyboard Lounge'': the trumpeter Dwight Adams, the pianist Gerard Gibbs, the bassist Ralphe Armstrong and the drummer Leonard King. At times the only thing linking the performance to Holiday might be the simple magnetism of an artist in command of an instrument, engaged by the flicker of a moment. (Wednesday at 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44.)</p>

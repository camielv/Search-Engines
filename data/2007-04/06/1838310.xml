        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for your touching and important story about Arnold Blume (''Why Listen to the Substitute? At 81, He Tells History Firsthand,'' front page, April 4).</p>
        <p>With grandchildren today often not living near their grandparents, an important influence on youth is being lost. Older teachers help fill that gap.</p>
        <p>My mother taught elementary school for 30 years and retired at 65 to care for her mother, who had a stroke. After her mother died, she went back to school to volunteer two hours each morning and has continued to do so for the last 13 years.</p>
        <p>She will turn 80 this summer. The children love her.</p>
        <p>As a social work intern at a local senior center, I know many people in their 80s and 90s. I learn from their stories and from their way of being. Sure, they have their flaws like everyone, but I will miss the honesty, openness and goodness of this generation when they are no longer with us.</p>

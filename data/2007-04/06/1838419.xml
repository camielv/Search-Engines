      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A coalition of advocacy and neighborhood groups filed a lawsuit yesterday in State Supreme Court seeking to overturn the state's approval of the Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, charging that the review process was flawed. The suit, filed by 26 groups, stated that the Empire State Development Corporation intentionally understated or played down the potential costs and traffic and pollution effects of the project in its zeal to approve it in December. The $4 billion project, proposed by the developer Forest City Ratner, calls for eight million square feet of housing and office space and a basketball arena near Downtown Brooklyn.</p>

        <p>The State Department of Labor said yesterday that the unemployment insurance services provided at 250 Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn and at 138-60 Barclay Avenue in Flushing, Queens, have been phased out. It said claimants were sent three notification letters before the phaseout. The department said those people who relied on either of the offices are encouraged to use its telephone or Internet claims systems. The department also said that it has expanded outreach to Chinese speakers, including making more interpreters available. The toll-free phone number for claims questions is (888) 209-8124.</p>

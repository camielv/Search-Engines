        <p>Gov. Charlie Crist persuaded Florida's clemency board Thursday to let most felons easily regain their voting rights after prison, saying it was time to leave the ''offensive minority'' of states that uniformly deny ex-offenders such rights.</p>
        <p>The change is a major step for Florida, which bans more people from the polls than any other state, but it did not go as far as Mr. Crist had hoped.

        <p>Gov. Charlie Crist persuaded Florida's clemency board Thursday to let most felons easily regain their voting rights after prison, saying it was time to leave the ''offensive minority'' of states that uniformly deny ex-offenders such rights.</p>
        <p>The change is a major step for Florida, which bans more people from the polls than any other state, but it did not go as far as Mr. Crist had hoped. Two of his fellow Republicans on the clemency board rejected his original plan to grant speedy restoration to everyone except murderers and sex criminals.</p>
        <p>Florida has as many as 950,000 disenfranchised ex-offenders -- far more than any other state -- the vast majority black. Other states have repealed or scaled back similar bans in recent years, but roughly five million felons remain barred from the polls nationwide.</p>
        <p>The Jim Crow-era ban, added to Florida's Constitution in 1968, has been the subject of especially bitter debate since the 2000 presidential election. Some legal voters were removed from the state's rolls that year after being misidentified as felons, adding to the drama of a recount that gave George W. Bush a razor-thin margin of victory over Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Only two other states, Kentucky and Virginia, constitutionally require all felons to forfeit their voting rights. A federal lawsuit seeking to overturn Florida's ban made its way to the United States Supreme Court in 2005, but the court declined to hear the case.</p>
        <p>Until now in Florida, most felons who finished prison and probation time had to submit to a lengthy review and waiting period, and sometimes an investigation and hearing, if they wanted to regain the right to vote.</p>
        <p>Under the new rules, the roughly 80 percent of ex-offenders whose crimes were not considered violent will win automatic rights restoration after the state makes sure they have paid any restitution to victims and have no pending criminal charges.</p>
        <p>Convicted murderers, sexual predators and ''violent career criminals'' will still need an investigation of their case and a hearing before the clemency board. Most will probably not regain the right to vote, serve on a jury or get jobs that require state licenses, like as a barber or nurse.</p>
        <p>''This is Holy Week, a week that is all about forgiveness,'' Mr. Crist said before the vote at a special meeting of the clemency board in Tallahassee. ''Restoring civil rights is the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Of the four clemency board members, only Attorney General Bill McCollum opposed the change, saying the board should carefully investigate and deliberate before restoring any convicted criminal's rights. Agriculture Secretary Charles Bronson, a Republican, and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, a Democrat, voted for the rule change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crist, who sat on the clemency board as the attorney general under Gov. Jeb Bush, said he had only recently come to believe that most felons deserved swift restoration of their rights.</p>
        <p>''It's something I've been thinking about for quite some time,'' he said, ''but it came to fruition last year. You'd always like more, but this is historic, what happened today in Florida.''</p>
        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida has fought the voting ban for years, and Howard Simon, its executive director, said Thursday that the changes appeared significant.</p>
        <p>''This seriously addresses, finally, some of the wounds from the Civil War era,'' Mr. Simon said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Simon said he worried that nonviolent ex-offenders who have been out on the streets for years might slip through the cracks and not have their rights automatically restored. A spokeswoman for Mr. Crist said such people -- who number in the tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands -- would have to take the initiative.</p>
        <p>The state will encourage them to make themselves known by running advertisements and other forms of outreach. But Mr. Simon said the burden should be on the state, not the ex-offender.</p>
        <p>''This is progress,'' he said, ''but for people who are already out, it is not as truly automatic as it could be.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 7, 2007, Saturday  An article yesterday about a decision by Florida's clemency board to let most felons easily regain their voting rights after prison misstated the year a ban on voting by felons was added to the state Constitution. It was 1868, not 1968.</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 17, 2007, Tuesday  An article on April 6 about a decision by Florida's clemency board to let most felons easily regain their voting rights after prison misstated the proportion of blacks among the state's disenfranchised ex-offenders. About 21 percent of the estimated 950,000 ex-offenders are black, according to the Sentencing Project, a liberal advocacy group in Washington -- not ''the vast majority.''</p>

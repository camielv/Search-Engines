        <p>For thousands of truck drivers working Brazil's biggest soybean export routes, the road is full of potholes the size of large pizzas.</p>
        <p>Here at a soybean-loading terminal for the grain company Bunge, scores of long-haul rigs line up for 12 to 24 hours to receive their cargoes in the stifling heat of late summer. Drivers are required to lurch forward by a truck-length every half an hour or so. Waiting, they play dominoes and trade stories of mythic-size potholes.</p>
        <p>The deep holes pocking the BR-163 highway help to keep drivers awake during the 683-mile journey south to the Maringa train depot that takes around 20 hours. The highway also leads on to Brazil's major southern Atlantic ports, Santos and Paranaguá.</p>
        <p>Inconveniently, the expansion of soybean farming in Brazil is near the center of the South American continent, and more than a thousand miles from the nearest saltwater port. That leaves the region's farmers to pay the soaring costs of freight. As the volume increases, Brazil's transport networks appear fraught with potential chokepoints.</p>
        <p>Ample farmland, sunlight and water resources in the state of Mato Grosso have made it a major supplier of soybeans for China. But two-thirds of the region's soybeans are still moved by truck. Rigs that carry up to 47 tons make 256,000 runs a year, mostly from March to August.</p>
        <p>The infrastructure remains strained despite government promises of improvement. BR-163, the main highway, opened in 1970 as a two-lane road to accommodate a small number of farmers, was not designed to withstand 10 million tons of soy cargo.</p>
        <p>Manoel Requena, 48, has made many all-night hauls. A southern Brazilian, Mr. Requena has spent most of 30 years driving a long-haul rig. Drivers like himself, he said, are in such demand that they generally work 30 days before taking 5 days off.</p>
        <p>To keep trucking, Mr. Requena and other drivers rely on a concoction of guarana syrup, black coffee and Coca-Cola, and, when heavy drowsiness sets in, they add toothpaste to the mix. Some drivers inevitably turn to more powerful stimulants.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mr. Requena's driving partner fell asleep at the wheel. The crash left Mr. Requena unconscious for the 10 hours it took for rescuers to arrive and free him. His partner was thrown from the rig but lived. Mr. Requena was ordered by doctors to stay off the road for 18 months.</p>
        <p>If the soy farmers and grain traders had their way, they would rely less on the diesel trucks to carry soybeans and more on cheaper waterway or rail transport.</p>
        <p>The cost of moving a ton of soybeans from Mato Grosso to port was $88 in February, much higher than Brazil's $48 average cost for soybean transport, and nearly six times the average cost of $15 a ton in the United States, according to the Brazilian Vegetable Oils Association.</p>
        <p>''We recognize that we are coming close to a real bottleneck,'' said Eduardo Bartolomeu, who runs logistics for Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the large mining company and a major stakeholder in Brazil's railroad and port assets. ''The infrastructure in place isn't competitive over the long term.''</p>
        <p>A dearth of railway and river options in Brazil has kept the trucks rolling. Brazil's government in January introduced a plan that would allocate more than $28 billion to improve transportation through 2010. The plans include adding 1,500 miles of rail, but it is not clear where the money will come from.</p>
        <p>''A lot was said a few years ago about big partnerships between C.V.R.D. and China to boost the country's railroad infrastructure,'' a company spokesman, Fernando Thompson, said. ''None of those plans have gone forward, and we have no current discussions under way with Chinese companies'' on expansion.</p>
        <p>C.V.R.D. may help build a new north-south railway link, Mr. Bartolomeu said -- but only if it ''makes economic sense.'' For now, amid sharp competition for space on cargo trains, the company has reduced the soybean products it shipped by rail last year by 11 percent, to 5.8 million tons. The level was still more than double the soy that the company shipped in 2001.</p>
        <p>One key rail link that takes Mato Grosso beans to the São Paulo coast, which is operated by the logistics company América Latina Logística, has cut its soybean cargoes by around a third this year, forcing even more trucks into action, said José Luiz Glaser, the general manager for grains and oilseeds at Cargill Brazil. América Latina Logística denied reducing overall cargo on its railroad, and said its shipments of farm products, particularly sugar, had risen this year.</p>
        <p>As the rigs finally near Brazil's southern ports, they are sometimes thrust into long lines. The season's cooling afternoon showers come as no relief from the heat. Strict humidity limits on soybean cargoes mean that loading grinds to a halt during rains.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes the worst lines aren't so bad for us,'' Mr. Requena said. ''When traffic is at a standstill, you can close your eyes.''</p>

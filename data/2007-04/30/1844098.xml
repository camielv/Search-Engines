        <p>Angelique Kidjo  Djin Djin  (Razor &amp; Tie/Starbucks Entertainment)</p>
        <p>The second half of ''Djin Djin,'' by Angelique Kidjo, finds this Beninese singer in characteristically good form. Backed by a choice selection of musicians, including her countrymen Crespin Kpitiki and Benoit Avihoue on percussion, she handily reinforces her stature as an upbeat heroine of contemporary Afro-pop.</p>
        <p>But it's the album's first half that grabs the attention, with a parade of guest stars, a social agenda and decidedly mixed results. While Peter Gabriel sounds comfortable on a song called ''Salala,'' Joss Stone struggles with a peppy take on ''Gimme Shelter'' by the Rolling Stones. Ziggy Marley brings a reggae lilt; Alicia Keys and the saxophonist Branford Marsalis import a whiff of R&amp;B. Predictably, it's ''Senamou,'' featuring the Malian duo Amadou and Mariam, that stands out as the best of the bunch.</p>
        <p>The worst, perhaps also predictably, is a summit with Josh Groban on vocals and Carlos Santana on guitar, performing ''Pearls,'' Sade's vintage lament for a suffering Somali woman. ''She lives a life she didn't choose,'' Mr. Groban cries, harmonizing with Ms. Kidjo, ''and it hurts like brand new shoes.'' (That materialistic metaphor was always a bit inappropriate; in this context it also feels spectacularly awkward.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Kidjo, a goodwill ambassador for Unicef, has unassailable credentials in the field of global poverty awareness. And she has long been a committed hybridist, with a vision of the African musical diaspora that includes gospel, soul and jazz. But ''Djin Djin,'' with production by Tony Visconti, nudges her too far in the direction of voguish pop compassion. The gloss and guests may yield something more appealing to a mass market -- or maybe a coffeehouse clientele -- but they don't make for a better album.</p>

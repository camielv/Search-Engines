        <p>TELECOM DEAL IN ITALY -- Telef贸nica and a group of Italian investors have agreed to pay about $5.6 billion for an 18 percent stake in Telecom Italia, which would let Telef贸nica, Europe's second-largest telecommunications provider, enter the Italian market and extend its presence in Latin America. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>ALL ME, ALL THE TIME -- The social networking phenomenon is leaving the confines of the personal computer. Powerful new mobile devices are allowing people to send round-the-clock updates about their vacations, their moods or their latest haircut. [C1.]</p>
        <p>A NEW FILM RISK -- If the horror at Virginia Tech has changed the chemistry of America's popular culture, those who count box-office receipts at Lionsgate will be among the first to know. The independent studio still plans to release on June 8 its ''Hostel: Part II,'' about the torture killing of college students. [C1.]</p>
        <p>SPEAKING VIAGRA -- In promoting Viagra, its impotence treatment, Pfizer has irritated regulators with its wink-and-a-nod ads. Now it has ads feature middle-aged men and women talking in a made-up language, save for one word. [C1.]</p>
        <p>YAHOO MAKES A DEAL -- Yahoo plans to acquire Right Media, a privately held company that runs an advertising marketplace. [C2.]</p>
        <p>U.N.'S SOLE ACCREDITED BLOGGER -- Matthew Lee, left, is the only blogger at the United Nations with media credentials, entitling him to free office space and access to briefings and news conferences. The United Nations is one of the few institutions of size and importance that allow bloggers not affiliated with larger, more traditional media companies. [C6.]</p>
        <p>THE FIVE-MINUTE 'STARSKY' -- The Sony Corporation has shrunk episodes of '70s and '80s television series to three and a half to five minutes, hoping to create a new business in retooling old shows for a new era of entertainment. [C4.]</p>
        <p>COMPETITIVE VOCABULARY -- Now that spelling bees have been turned into a hit Broadway show and crossword puzzles into a movie, the publishers of the American Heritage dictionary are hoping to create a cultural moment with a competitive game about word definitions. [C4.]</p>
        <p>ALL YOUR STUFF, ONLINE -- At least three companies have emerged in recent months with the aim of helping people catalog and value their possessions and post them online. The plan is to attract millions of people, then find retailers who want to sell them more items to go along with their possessions. [C8.]</p>
        <p>MORE GARDEN THAN GUN -- The title of Garden &amp; Gun, a new lifestyle magazine from Charleston, S.C., might not have raised eyebrows had it not been for the fact that the premiere issue hit newsstands just days before the shootings at Virginia Tech on April 16. [C6.]</p>
        <p>GOOGLING STATE DATA -- Four states have joined forces with Google to make information from their Web sites more directly accessible through Internet searches. [C8.]</p>
        <p>INVESTING IN CLEAN ENERGY -- Money flowing into alternative energy companies is raising the threat of a bubble, according to a research firm, but investors may be overlooking other clean technologies. [C7.]</p>
        <p>A PLUG FOR PHONE LEAKS -- Drumming up business would seem to be an easy task for those who sell encrypted cellphones in Italy. All they have to do is browse the major newspapers, looking for leaked telephone conversations. [C6.]</p>
        <p>EX-ABC NEWSMAN MOVING TO TIME -- Mark Halperin, the longtime political director of ABC News and a pioneer of online reporting, is moving to Time magazine. [C2.]</p>
        <p>ADS FOR INTERNET RADIO -- A start-up company, TargetSpot, is trying to turn the nascent field of Internet radio into a viable business, and CBS Radio is its first customer. [C10.]</p>
        <p>CHINA TIGHTENS MONEY AGAIN -- For the second time this month, China has ordered banks to hold more of their deposits in reserve as it seeks to prevent credit and investment growth from destabilizing the economy. [C2.]</p>
        <p>BEST PLACES TO BLOG ABOUT -- Clinton Hill in Brooklyn is the most blogged-about neighborhood in America, says a Web site that found a link between gentrification and the number of people who feel compelled to think out loud about the changes in their backyards. [C6.]</p>
        <p>WHAT GOES AROUND</p>
        <p>-- The pop culture magazine Radar has accused a Chilean magazine of ripping off its story on ''Toxic Bachelors,'' but freely admits that it borrowed the concept from other sources, like a book by Danielle Steele and the ''Sex and the City'' series. [C6.]</p>

        <p>Editorial scores Republican presidential hopefuls who are letting momentum for comprehensive immigration reform stall in Washington by trumpeting border security and decrying 'amnesty' on campaign trail; singles out Sen John McCain, noting he once lent his name to promising immigration bill</p>

        <p>We have all seen how presidential candidates shift positions to impress primary voters. It's usually as measured and boring as dance instruction: O.K. everyone, now dip to the right -- or left -- then back to center. But on the volatile topic of immigration, Republicans are lurching, falling over themselves to convince voters that where they stand is not where they stood.</p>
        <p>The fakery is hard to watch, as it comes at a time when courage and bipartisan realism are critically important. The Iowa maunderings of two candidates in particular -- Senators Sam Brownback and John McCain -- have complicated the prospects of a bipartisan immigration bill that would affect millions of lives. While the bill's fate is being decided in difficult closed-door negotiations in the Capitol, they and other G.O.P. hopefuls are on the stump, tying themselves in knots on ''amnesty'' and dancing farther out to the fringes of public opinion.</p>

        <p>We have all seen how presidential candidates shift positions to impress primary voters. It's usually as measured and boring as dance instruction: O.K. everyone, now dip to the right -- or left -- then back to center. But on the volatile topic of immigration, Republicans are lurching, falling over themselves to convince voters that where they stand is not where they stood.</p>
        <p>The fakery is hard to watch, as it comes at a time when courage and bipartisan realism are critically important. The Iowa maunderings of two candidates in particular -- Senators Sam Brownback and John McCain -- have complicated the prospects of a bipartisan immigration bill that would affect millions of lives. While the bill's fate is being decided in difficult closed-door negotiations in the Capitol, they and other G.O.P. hopefuls are on the stump, tying themselves in knots on ''amnesty'' and dancing farther out to the fringes of public opinion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brownback is a right-wing Republican whose religion teaches compassion for the stranger -- immigrants, too. He was a co-sponsor of last year's bipartisan Senate bill. But this year he bailed out of negotiations, and last week disowned his vote for last year's bill, to the delight of conservatives who scorned him as ''Amnesty Sam.''</p>
        <p>Mitt Romney is also going through contortions. The Boston Globe posted audio clips of Mr. Romney praising, in 2005, an immigration bill sponsored by Mr. McCain and Senator Edward Kennedy as sensible and ''quite different'' from amnesty, then dissing it as amnesty in this year's campaign. Mr. Romney now wallows in the support of Joe Arpaio, the showboating Phoenix sheriff famous for humiliating prisoners and pushing a round-'em-all-up approach.</p>
        <p>Rudolph Giuliani has sharply changed his tone. Once a stout defender of immigrants, Mr. Giuliani now talks about sending people to the back of the line and installing ''heat-seeking equipment'' at the border. He insists that he opposes amnesty, but the ''amnesty'' he objects to is an ''amnesty'' nobody is talking about -- blanket forgiveness, a free pass to a green card. Once you hear him talking about helping immigrants who pay fines and back taxes, stay out of trouble, learn English and wait in the back of the visa line, it seems clear that he belongs in the comprehensive-reform fold with Mr. Kennedy and others -- whether he admits it or not.</p>
        <p>Of all the retreats, the most disheartening may be Mr. McCain's. This former straight talker once lent his name to the most promising immigration bill in Congress. But as Senator Kennedy has struggled to draft a compromise this year, his former partner has been trumpeting border security on the campaign trail and letting momentum for comprehensive reform stall in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain and his adversaries may believe that primary politics demands such behavior, but surveys of the larger populace tell a different story. Americans want the immigration issue solved, and they strongly favor ''amnesty,'' whether you call it that or not. An array of recent polls show powerful support for an earned path to citizenship.</p>
        <p>''Call it a banana if you want to,'' Mr. McCain said of the amnesty debate last year, in a welcome moment of lucidity. If a good bill emerges, it will be because enough lawmakers stayed focused and kept their heads. If the effort collapses, a large share of the blame must go to amnesty-fixated Republicans lost in the fog of the 2008 presidential race.</p>

        <p>WEINSIER--Philip, April 28, 2007, age 91, at home and, as always, with class. Handsome, beloved husband of the late Joan Tuby Weinsier, cherished and treasured father of Michael Weinsier (Marcy) and Wendy Segal (Danny) and loving and adored grandfather of Matthew and Jacqueline. Sweet, kind sonin-law of Evelyn Tuby and admired brother-in-law of Suellen Globus. Loving brother of the late Grace Maslow and Shirley, Saul and Randolph Weinsier. ''Ace'' was his name, golf was his game and race horses were his passion. Graduate of Washington and Lee University, WWII Army Lieutenant. The last of the great gentlemen, with humor 'til the end. A gracious man. Funeral private. Donations can be made in his name to the American Cancer Society or the Visiting Nurse Service of New York Hospice Care.</p>

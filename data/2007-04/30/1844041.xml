      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland called Sunday for a general election on May 24.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ahern and his centrist party, Fianna Fail, have governed in a coalition government since 1997. But opinion polls suggest that despite an economic boom, the coalition is in danger of losing its majority in the 166-seat Irish Parliament because of public disgruntlement about overburdened public services, including hospitals, and antiquated roads.</p>
        <p>Under Irish law, which requires legislative elections every five years, Mr. Ahern had to call elections by midsummer.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, he said he would base his campaign for re-election on his work to strengthen the economy and efforts to revive Northern Ireland's stalled peace process this year. Political analysts said they expected Mr. Ahern's work in Northern Ireland to be an asset.</p>
        <p>After decades of underachievement and mass emigration, Ireland has been one of the great economic success stories of Europe, with real growth, adjusted for inflation, that has been averaging 5 percent to 6 percent annually for years. That prosperity allowed Mr. Ahern to cut taxes and to start spending on a so-called National Development Plan to update infrastructure and improve public services.</p>
        <p>But Sean Donnelly, a leading opinion pollster and analyst, said the boom in Ireland might not assure Mr. Ahern a victory. ''A lot of young people do not remember the bad times, and the opposition will be saying that the government has been wasteful and too slow in improving health services,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In announcing his bid for re-election, Mr. Ahern also said he would work for ''a lasting peace'' in Northern Ireland and toward achieving Irish unity.</p>
        <p>Since 1997, Mr. Ahern has worked closely with Tony Blair, the British prime minister, to help bring an end to politically motivated violence in Northern Ireland. He helped secure the 1998 Good Friday peace accord.</p>
        <p>This year, he and Mr. Blair participated in brokering a deal between the leaders of Northern Ireland's dominant rival groups, Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein and the Protestant leader, the Rev. Ian Paisley, who agreed to form a joint administration for the British-ruled province on May 8.</p>
        <p>Fianna Fail, Mr. Ahern's party, holds 79 seats in the Irish Parliament, and the Progressive Democrats, its partner party, holds 8 seats. The main opposition party, Fine Gael, which has not won a major election for 25 years, has 32 seats.</p>

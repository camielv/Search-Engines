        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-8</p>
        <p>Iran Announces Intentions To Attend Iraq Conference  The government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran announced that it would attend a regional conference on Iraq this week, setting the stage for the first cabinet-level meeting between Iran and the United States since 2004.  A1</p>
        <p>Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, is interviewing candidates for a new high-profile job that people in Washington are calling the war czar. The official would brief President Bush every morning on Iraq and Afghanistan, then prod cabinet secretaries into carrying out White House orders.  A1</p>
        <p>Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr clashed with American forces in northern Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said, the latest in a series of indications that the militia may be emerging from two months of self-imposed dormancy. A5</p>
        <p>Ireland Head Calls for Elections  Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland called for a general election next month. Under Irish law Mr. Ahern had to call elections by midsummer. He said he would campaign for re-election on the strength of the economy and helping restore Northern Ireland's stalled peace process. A6</p>
        <p>Conduct Report Looms in Israel  As an official report on the Israeli government's failings during the recent war against Hezbollah in Lebanon is about to be published, the main topic of public debate is whether Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will be able to hang onto power. Current polls show his approval ratings hovering between 2 and 3 percent.  A6</p>
        <p>U.S.-Afghan Raid Kills 6  American and Afghan troops raided a suspected bomb-making compound killing six people, including two women, and wounding two children, Afghan officials said. Angry villagers took the bodies of victims onto the main Kabul-to-Pakistan highway and demonstrated for more than five hours. A6</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A14-18</p>
        <p>Maine's Health Overhaul Harbors Costly Lessons  Maine's new health care system was intended to provide universal care and cover 130,000 uninsured residents. But so far only 18,800 people have signed up for the state's coverage, DirigoChoice. The story of Maine's health program may harbor lessons for the country, as efforts to cover the uninsured take center stage in nearly every state.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Obama's Religious Background  Senator Barack Obama converted to Christianity as an adult after an upbringing that offered him a course in comparative religion but no belief to call his own. Now his ties to a controversial Chicago minister have become a delicate issue for him as a presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Freeway Collapses in Bay Area  A tanker truck accident caused a freeway overpass near downtown Oakland to collapse, sending hundreds of feet of concrete crashing onto a highway below, injuring the driver of the tanker truck. The repairs are likely to complicate the lives of Bay Area commuters for months.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Democrats Divided Over Veto  The Democratic presidential field is divided over how to respond to President Bush's expected veto of legislation setting a timeline for removing troops from Iraq. While the candidates agree that the war should be ended, they differ over how fast troops should be withdrawn.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Spokesman Returns to Work  Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, is to return to work today, while undergoing chemotherapy after a five-week absence after having discovered his colon cancer had spread to his liver.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>Wrong Suspect Copes With Loss  The killing of the first victim of the Virginia Tech shootings, Emily Hilscher, initially drew suspicion to her boyfriend, Karl D. Thornhill. Although he was soon cleared of wrongdoing, he is still coping with losing his girlfriend and being suspected in her death.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION B1-4</p>
        <p>Patrons Take a Final Ride As Historic Stable Closes  The Claremont Riding Academy, the oldest continuously operated stable in New York City, has officially closed its doors. What made Claremont unique was not so much what it was but where it was: in the heart of the Upper West Side.  B1</p>
        <p>Little Relief for Over-65 Set  When Gov. Eliot Spitzer and legislative leaders announced $1.3 billion in new property tax relief, they did not mention that taxpayers 65 and older ended up with hardly any more money than they received last year under the plan.  B1</p>
        <p>An Artist's Legacy  It would be impossible to mention Eddie Boros, an artist from the East Village who died on Friday, without describing his most visible work: a looming sculpture that rises 65 feet. The structure's survival over more than two decades has elevated it to the status of a neighborhood institution. B3</p>

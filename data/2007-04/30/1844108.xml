        <p>A 13-year-old boy riding a borrowed bicycle was struck and killed by a sport utility vehicle as he ventured into a Brooklyn intersection just after midnight yesterday, according to the police and his family. The driver of the S.U.V. fled the scene, the police said.</p>
        <p>The boy, Anthony Delgado, was pedaling home from another friend's baptism party along Palmetto Street in Bushwick with his best friend, Ricky Alicea, 15, relatives said. When they reached Central Avenue, Ricky was the first to cross the intersection, which has no traffic light, stop sign or crosswalk.</p>

        <p>A 13-year-old boy riding a borrowed bicycle was struck and killed by a sport utility vehicle as he ventured into a Brooklyn intersection just after midnight yesterday, according to the police and his family. The driver of the S.U.V. fled the scene, the police said.</p>
        <p>The boy, Anthony Delgado, was pedaling home from another friend's baptism party along Palmetto Street in Bushwick with his best friend, Ricky Alicea, 15, relatives said. When they reached Central Avenue, Ricky was the first to cross the intersection, which has no traffic light, stop sign or crosswalk.</p>
        <p>''I was right across the street looking at him to be sure he got across,'' Ricky said. A car was approaching, but slowly enough that Anthony began to cross the one-way street anyway, Ricky said. Suddenly, a black S.U.V. darted out from behind the slower car, to pass it, and struck Anthony.</p>
        <p>''I saw the bike go under the car,'' Ricky said, adding of the driver, ''Then he hit the gas when he saw me running to Anthony.'' Ricky said he called 911, then Anthony's mother, Antonia Cansino.</p>
        <p>Tamika Zayas, 32, said she was in front of her home nearby and heard the impact when the boy was hit. She said the S.U.V. threw him 15 feet, where he fell motionless on the street. ''Like he was sleeping,'' she said.</p>
        <p>When an ambulance arrived, she said, ''they put gauze on his head, but it bled right through.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zayas said police officers who happened to be nearby, asking someone to turn down a music player, chased the S.U.V., but it got away.</p>
        <p>Anthony was taken to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:40 a.m. yesterday, the police said.</p>
        <p>Investigators were looking for surveillance cameras in the area yesterday, hoping that one or more of them had video showing the S.U.V.</p>
        <p>''I think he's very heartless,'' Anthony's stepfather, Thomas Cruz, 42, a supervisor with the Department of Transportation, said of the driver. ''He should put himself in the position we're in.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cansino, 29, said that yesterday was Anthony's sister's fifth birthday. ''She's waiting for him to come and say, 'Happy birthday' to her,'' Ms. Cansino said. ''She's asking for him. She's asking, 'Mommy, when is Anthony coming home?' I want him to come through that door so bad.''</p>
        <p>Anthony had five siblings, family members said.</p>
        <p>He was an avid Yankees fan, wearing a team cap everywhere, and he wanted to design cars when he grew up. He was preparing to graduate from fifth grade at Public School 81 on De Kalb Avenue, his mother said.</p>
        <p>His own bicycle was stolen recently, so he was using a friend's bike Saturday night, Ricky said.</p>
        <p>Ricky's mother, Daisy Alicea, 49, an assistant teacher with Head Start, said Anthony was a happy, caring boy. ''When he would see me coming home from work, he'd give me a kiss and a hug and call me auntie,'' she said. ''When I went to the laundry, he'd help me bring the clothes up, and without asking.''</p>
        <p>A small memorial with candles and Anthony's picture was set up at the curb near where he had been hit. On a lamppost above it, the police had placed a notice seeking information about the accident.</p>

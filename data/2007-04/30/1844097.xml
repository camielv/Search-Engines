        <p>Tori Amos  American Doll Posse (Epic)</p>
        <p>Tori Amos recently announced that her new album was ''an opportunity to reclaim the segmented pieces of the female psyche'' -- and, she added, to ''reunite them.'' Is that all? To this end, Ms. Amos has created five personae -- Isabel, Clyde, Pip, Santa and, confusingly, Tori -- to sing the 23 songs on ''American Doll Posse.'' Before you ask: yes, each persona does maintain a personal Web site.</p>

        <p>Tori Amos  American Doll Posse (Epic)</p>
        <p>Tori Amos recently announced that her new album was ''an opportunity to reclaim the segmented pieces of the female psyche'' -- and, she added, to ''reunite them.'' Is that all? To this end, Ms. Amos has created five personae -- Isabel, Clyde, Pip, Santa and, confusingly, Tori -- to sing the 23 songs on ''American Doll Posse.'' Before you ask: yes, each persona does maintain a personal Web site.</p>
        <p>By this point in her extraordinary career, 15 years removed from her blockbuster solo debut, ''Little Earthquakes,'' Ms. Amos has weeded out most of the casual listeners from her fan base; the tourists are gone and the Torists remain. But ''American Doll Posse'' isn't quite the fans-only project it might first seem to be. Although the album's conceit might seem heavy-handed, Ms. Amos treats the whole thing like a game: this is her most entertaining album in years, precisely because she keeps switching among characters and styles.</p>
        <p>Not that everything works. The first song, ''Yo George,'' is a shopworn political lament. (She murmurs, ''Where have we gone wrong America?/Mr. Lincoln we can't seem/to find you anywhere.'') But it's over in little more than a minute (one upside to cramming 23 tracks onto a CD), replaced by a jagged and mischievous Southern-rock song, ''Big Wheel.'' This album is full of pleasant surprises: the R.E.M. flourish that opens ''Secret Spell''; the sleek bass line in ''Bouncing Off Clouds''; the 90-second orchestral daydream that is ''Programmable Soda.'' A message to lapsed Tori Amos fans: come back. You won't be bored.</p>

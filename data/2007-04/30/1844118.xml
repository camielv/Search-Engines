        <p>Gov. Eliot Spitzer announced yesterday that he would introduce legislation to lower costs for local governments, including changing a controversial law requiring multiple contractors for public construction projects. The law, called the Wicks Law, requires multiple contractors for projects costing more than $50,000, a threshold that has not been increased since the 1960s. The governor's proposal would increase the threshold to $1 million for projects upstate and $2 million for projects in New York City and would adjust the numbers annually for inflation. Other proposals include steps aimed at giving local governments more flexibility in procurement and allowing them to use administrative proceedings, rather than court action, to handle housing code violations. ''This bill will promote fiscal savings for our taxpayers, increase flexibility for our municipalities and ensure the long-term economic stability of our state,'' the governor said.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''In Its Match With China, India Penalizes Its Own Team,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, April 24):</p>
        <p>As an American of Indian origin, I am almost on the same wavelength as Mr. Kristof. Having just returned from my yearly trip to India, I can attest to the vast changes in India's rapid economic ascension, and I agree that much work needs to be done in rural India on the fronts of poverty, hunger and disease eradication. Decades back, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of free India, said India lives in its villages, and this is still true today.</p>
        <p>But I beg to differ with Mr. Kristof's pessimism about India's possibility in the race for Asian leadership. The younger generation today is strongly committed to making this happen. Although there is a long way to go, there has already been an honest beginning toward achieving economic progress that will go beyond India's urban areas and reach rural interiors.</p>
        <p>On the brighter side, India is one of the most vibrant democracies in the world. With the growing penetration of a vast communication network within the country, rural areas that have yet remained untouched by the economic boom will sooner or later share in the economic benefits of India's growth.</p>
        <p>This is precisely why I tell my kids to get a better exposure to Hindi, the national language of India, which I believe will be the key to India's economic future in the dynamics of today's globalization.</p>

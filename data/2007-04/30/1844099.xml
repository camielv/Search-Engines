        <p>The Fred Hersch Trio  Night &amp; the Music (Palmetto)</p>
        <p>There's a pristine quality to the pianism of Fred Hersch that can give the false impression of conservatism. On ''Night &amp; the Music,'' Mr. Hersch undercuts that feeling in subtle ways: a tremulous two-handed run here, a quietly mounting tension there. He sounds unfailingly articulate, on songbook standards as well as on several original tunes, and at times it all seems a bit too relaxed, if not exactly easy.</p>

        <p>The Fred Hersch Trio  Night &amp; the Music (Palmetto)</p>
        <p>There's a pristine quality to the pianism of Fred Hersch that can give the false impression of conservatism. On ''Night &amp; the Music,'' Mr. Hersch undercuts that feeling in subtle ways: a tremulous two-handed run here, a quietly mounting tension there. He sounds unfailingly articulate, on songbook standards as well as on several original tunes, and at times it all seems a bit too relaxed, if not exactly easy.</p>
        <p>Beneath the surface, Mr. Hersch addresses a network of complexities, especially in his perpetual conversation with the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer Nasheet Waits. That process is much easier to scout out on some of these tracks (Irving Berlin's ''Change Partners'') than others (Cole Porter's ''So in Love''). What runs through everything is the clarity of attention among the musicians, along with their shared respect for melody.</p>
        <p>One especially engaging song, an original by Mr. Hersch called ''Gravity's Pull,'' derives much of its strength from the gently halting propulsion of Mr. Waits. The next track, by Mr. Gress, represents the album's most abstract elaboration, though its elasticity pertains strictly to rhythm. On ''Rhythm Spirit,'' another original, Mr. Hersch ventures some passing tonalities that could even qualify as avant-garde.</p>
        <p>Those distinctions are beside the point here. ''Night &amp; the Music'' conveys a spirit of adventure even in some of the more sumptuous ballad work. The fruitful middle ground might best be represented by a pair of compositions by Thelonious Monk, long a touchstone for Mr. Hersch. They are ''Boo Boo's Birthday'' and ''Misterioso,'' and each develops intelligently but gradually, with the stealthiest of subversions.</p>

        <p>Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's profile in the capital during the Spitzer administration has, at times, seemed lower than his voice, which registers so far down on the bass clef that Empire Zone has to lean in to hear.</p>
        <p>And so it remained as Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, skirmished last week. On Monday, the governor howled after Mr. Bruno rejected his proposed campaign finance reforms, and by the next morning, Mr. Spitzer was kicking off a statewide tour to bash Senate Republicans, beginning in Mr. Bruno's district upstate.</p>
        <p>Albany's focus shifted abruptly on Wednesday, after the shooting of three state troopers -- one of whom died -- in the course of 24 hours. Mr. Bruno immediately made it his priority to reinstate the death penalty for those who murder law officers. Mr. Spitzer spent the rest of the week unveiling a host of proposals -- from strengthening New York's abortion laws to wresting control of the redistricting process from the Legislature -- while Mr. Bruno said he should focus on economic development and other issues.</p>
        <p>Speaker Silver, above, contented himself to lie in the weeds. Having served a dozen years as former Gov. George E. Pataki's chief Democratic foil -- and as the party's loudest voice in the capital -- Mr. Silver has spent the first few months of the year largely trying to stay out of Mr. Spitzer's way.</p>
        <p>''When the rhetoric tones down a little bit I will try and bring the parties, again, together and see if we can engage in constructive dialogue,'' the speaker said on Wednesday morning, referring to campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>''So you're the conciliator here?'' a reporter asked.</p>
        <p>''Always have been. I don't know why you have that doubt,'' Mr. Silver replied with a sly grin. ''My career is filled with conciliation.''</p>

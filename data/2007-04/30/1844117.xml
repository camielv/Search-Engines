        <p>They are underdogs no more. In fact, the Golden State Warriors may need to get used to a new identity.</p>
        <p>The Warriors defeated the Dallas Mavericks again Sunday night, 103-99, and are now one victory away from completing one of the biggest upsets in N.B.A. history.</p>
        <p>Baron Davis scored 33 points, including the layup that put the Warriors ahead to stay. Golden State, the eighth-seeded team in the Western Conference, has a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series and can oust the top-seeded Mavericks on Tuesday in Dallas.</p>
        <p>Only eight teams in league history have won a series after trailing by 3-1, and Dirk Nowitzki was surprisingly candid when assessing his team's chances a day earlier.</p>
        <p>''If we lose,'' Nowitzki told reporters Saturday, ''this season is pretty much over.''</p>
        <p>Neither his coach, Avery Johnson, nor his former coach, the Warriors' Don Nelson, endorsed the notion.</p>
        <p>''I think they're capable of winning three in a row at any time,'' Nelson said before tip-off. ''They won 17 at one time, as I recall.''</p>
        <p>Still, things felt desperate enough in the Dallas locker room that Jason Terry and Jerry Stackhouse called a players-only meeting Saturday, ''and they aired some things out,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Dallas led by as many as 9 points in the first half, but the Warriors never faded. They finished with a flourish, as Davis banked in a 3-pointer from 49 feet at the halftime buzzer, tying the score at 49-49.</p>
        <p>The momentum, and the deafening roar, carried into the third quarter, as Jason Richardson and Stephen Jackson opened the period with consecutive 3-pointers. Dallas briefly took control, using a 21-7 run to take a 70-62 lead, their biggest margin in two games here. But the Warriors stormed back. Davis led the charge, scoring their last 8 points of the quarter to tie the game at 77-77 by the end of the quarter.</p>
        <p>In the final 1 minute 16 seconds of the period, Davis had a free throw, a layup scored off his own missed foul shot, a 3-pointer, a block and finally, a stolen inbounds pass that he converted for a fast-break dunk.</p>
        <p>A record crowd of 20,672 again serenaded Davis with chants of ''M.V.P.,'' while Nowitzki -- a leading contender to win that award -- again came up small. Nowitzki, who has yet to have a big game in the series, finished with 23 points, including a pair of desperation 3-pointers in the final minute.</p>

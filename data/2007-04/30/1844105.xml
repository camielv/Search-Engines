        <p>Neither the governor nor the people in his ambitious political operation have made a secret of their designs on the Republican-led Senate, which holds a two-seat majority in the 62-member chamber. One of the targets in the 2008 election is Sen. Hugh T. Farley, a Republican from Schenectady, but their preferred candidate to replace him appears to be changing.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Spitzer, left, speaking from the steps of the Schenectady City Hall, chided Mr. Farley for joining Senate Republicans in opposing the governor's campaign finance reform plan. Notably absent during that speech was the city's mayor, Brian U. Stratton, once the Democrats' favorite to take on Mr. Farley. Party officials now prefer Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko of Amsterdam, who has represented the 105th District since 1983, because internal polls show him running more strongly than Mr. Stratton against Mr. Farley, said one person with knowledge of the Democrats' deliberations.</p>

        <p>Is Mr. Tonko, 57, planning to run?</p>
        <p>''I would acknowledge that paths can take many twists and turns, and I would not close my mind to any opportunity out there,'' he said. ''But I am happy with my service in the Assembly.''</p>
        <p>Translation: not ruling it out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stratton said that Mr. Tonko ''would make an outstanding senator,'' but he said he would consider another run against Mr. Farley. In 2000, Mr. Stratton lost to Mr. Farley by more than 11,000 votes.</p>

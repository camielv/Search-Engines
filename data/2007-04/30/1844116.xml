        <p>With the 17th pick in the fourth round (116th over all), the Giants drafted Zak DeOssie, an outside linebacker from Brown. DeOssie, whose father, Steve, played in the N.F.L. for 12 seasons, was the only player drafted from the Ivy League this year, and he was the first from Brown since Sean Morey in 1999.</p>
        <p>Since 1936, Brown has produced only 27 players who were drafted. But jumping to the N.F.L. from the Ivy League is not uncommon. The Giants have one Ivy Leaguer, Jim Finn, who went to Penn.</p>

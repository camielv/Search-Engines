        <p>The Suffolk County police shut down a stretch of the Long Island Expressway yesterday afternoon after a multicar pileup in Brentwood left the highway strewn with debris. No major injuries were reported, the police said. The police said a disabled vehicle was parked on the shoulder when another vehicle crashed into it about 2:30 p.m., setting off a chain of collisions involving as many as 10 other vehicles. The eastbound lanes of the expressway were closed between the Sagtikos Parkway and Wicks Road for nearly three hours.</p>

        <p>They say that things come in threes.

        <p>They say that things come in threes. If so, I know what will arrive soon: another deal where a good player finds a line of play that works even though the breaks are bad and gains points over someone who unwisely assumes that everything will be for the best in the best of all possible worlds -- as in both Saturday's column and today's.</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal occurred during a Swiss Team tournament on Tuesday at the Cincinnati Bridge Center.</p>
        <p>This auction, in which North's passed-hand two-club response looks like Drury, showing at least three-card heart support and a maximum pass, was actually all-natural.</p>
        <p>If the missing trumps are 3-2, there are 10 easy tricks: two spades, four hearts, two diamonds, one club and a spade ruff on the board. And in the other room the declarer, also in four hearts after an uncontested auction, made that assumption. He won the spade lead in his hand, took his other top spade, ruffed his third spade on the board, cashed dummy's heart king, then -- fatally -- led a trump to his ace. With the bad red-suit splits, he lost two hearts and two diamonds.</p>
        <p>The successful declarer was Pamela Granovetter of Cincinnati, who publishes Bridge Today magazine with her husband, Matthew. Deciding that she could wait to touch trumps, she won with her spade ace, led a diamond to dummy's king and played another diamond.</p>
        <p>East probably should have discarded, and if he had, declarer planned to win with her diamond ace, cash the spade king, ruff her last spade on the board, take the club ace and exit with dummy's last diamond, which would have brought home the contract.</p>
        <p>But East took the opportunity to score his singleton heart. Then he returned a spade. South won with her king, ruffed her last spade on the board and called for dummy's remaining diamond. When East discarded without thought, declarer assumed he had started with two red-suit singletons. She won with her diamond ace, ruffed her last diamond with dummy's heart ten, cashed the heart king and club ace, then ruffed a club in her hand. West overruffed but could take only one more trump trick. South had held her losers to three hearts.</p>
        <p>It was the old story that if the opponents' trumps are splitting 4-1 or 5-0, declarer usually does best not to touch that suit early in the play.</p>
        <p>Plus 100 and plus 620 gave 12 international match points to Granovetter and her teammates, Gail Arnow, Karen Grosser and Matthew Granovetter of Cincinnati. They finished second behind Harriet Spiegel, Ed Lee, Frank Lichtenberger and Nathaniel Reid of Cincinnati.</p>

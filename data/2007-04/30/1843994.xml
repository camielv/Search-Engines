        <p>7 P.M. (Cinemax) HELMUT BY JUNE -- Helmut Newton's photographs -- eroticized, subversive, sometimes disturbing images of lush-bodied women in sadomasochistic poses -- earned him the nickname the King of Kink. Newton, who died in 2004, said his models, including Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer and Helena Christensen, were a commodity ''paid to be made into what I want.'' In this documentary June Newton, his wife of 56 years as well as his muse and model, turns her lens on her husband (above; she is holding the camera with him) as he stages photo shoots in the 1990s and blurs the line between fine art and pornography.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) DANCING WITH THE STARS -- Heather Mills was so not surprised that she was eliminated on last week's results show that she tucked a farewell speech into the bodice of her glittery costume. Tonight six couples trip the light fantastic (or maybe just trip) in ballroom and Latin dances.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (My Network TV) I.F.L. BATTLEGROUND -- This newish series follows the action in the International Fight League, the first team-based professional mixed-martial-arts league, with glimpses of the Tucson Scorpions training camp and an interview with Ken Yasuda, the coach of the Tokyo Sabres.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CW) EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS -- After secretly listening to his parents' comedy albums, Chris gets into trouble when he tells dirty jokes at school in an attempt to be popular.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Food Network) FANTASY WEDDINGS -- An hour's worth of over-the-top weddings, with food to match.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13, 49) THE MORMONS -- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is said to be one of the world's fastest-growing religions, with more than half of its 12 million members living outside the United States. It's also one of the richest and most misunderstood. This two-part documentary uses interviews with church leaders, members and missionaries (above) -- as well as supporters and detractors -- to unravel the complexities and controversies. Part 2 will be shown tomorrow at 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>9:30 P.M. (CBS) THE KING OF QUEENS -- They're movin' on up -- or so Carrie thinks, when an apartment becomes available in Manhattan. Doug has different plans.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (FX) THE RICHES -- The Malloys, those nice grifters-next-door played by Minnie Driver and Eddie Izzard, hit one out of the ballpark when they con a shamed baseball player to preserve their cushy life in Edenfalls.</p>
        <p>11:35 P.M. (CBS) LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN -- Kirsten Dunst (right) talks about getting back in the swing of things as Mary Jane Watson, the object of a certain superhero's affection, in ''Spider-Man 3.'' Dinosaur Jr. performs.</p>

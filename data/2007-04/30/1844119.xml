        <p>A fire on Saturday that killed an 87-year-old woman as she was preparing for her daughter's surprise birthday party was started by children who were playing with a cigarette lighter, the Fire Department said yesterday. The fire started around 3:30 p.m. at 1136 Croes Avenue, in the Soundview neighborhood, in the ground-floor apartment of the victim, Carmen Davila. The flames quickly spread throughout the building. Ms. Davila's daughter, Antonia Povod, lived on the third floor and was out getting her nails done when the fire began. Seven people escaped from the building, and except for Ms. Davila, no one was seriously injured, the Fire Department said.</p>

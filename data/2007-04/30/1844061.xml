        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''His Own Pope Yet?'' (Op-Ed, April 23):</p>
        <p>David Gibson depicts Benedict XVI as a hard-liner who is trying to change his image by ''carefully accentuating the positive'' while in reality he's clamping down and being as reactionary as you might expect.</p>
        <p>But Pope Benedict's writings are incongruous with this picture.</p>
        <p>His first encyclical, ''God Is Love,'' turns out to include an exquisite summary of a notion that Benedict has been savoring for years: God's love, Benedict asserts, includes elements of eros, or love as desire, as well as agape, love as beneficence.</p>
        <p>So could it be that he is saying something revolutionary, not reactionary, in a document meant to stamp his papacy? I think so, and his actions have followed suit.</p>
        <p>The Regensburg, Germany, speech led to a colloquium and a dialogue with Muslim leaders. This isn't a surprise since the pope in his writings has long been a proponent of peace between religions as a way to peace between nations.</p>
        <p>European intellectuals have found in him a sounding board for their ideas.</p>
        <p>Just days ago, Benedict signed on to a document that makes the teaching of limbo a thing of the past. That doesn't seem to me like the pattern of a man bent on vindicating old dogmas.</p>

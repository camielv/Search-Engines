        <p>Tamil rebel warplanes bombed two fuel storage depots near this capital early Sunday, and the military said the raid tripped defenses that temporarily blacked out the city and closed the airport.</p>
        <p>Power was restored after a few hours and no major damage or injuries were reported. But the raid caused some panic in Colombo, where authorities instructed five-star luxury hotels not to use their backup power, to lessen the chance of the buildings becoming bombing targets.</p>
        <p>The raiding aircraft, described as light-propeller planes, dropped four bombs on the fuel depots, situated in the Muthurajawela area, just north of Colombo, witnesses and government officials said. A rebel spokesman, Rasiah Illanthiriyan, said the planes had returned successfully.</p>
        <p>The Air Force said it responded by bombing suspected Tamil rebel targets in the Vishvamadu and Iranamadu areas, about 190 miles north of Colombo. Further details about the retaliation were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>The rebel attack was the third in five weeks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has been fighting for years to gain an independent homeland for ethnic minority Tamils in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>The government hinted strongly on Sunday that it intended to get much tougher to stop further air attacks.</p>
        <p>''We will take effective measures to control the air capability'' of the Tamil Tigers, said Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, the mass media and information minister.</p>

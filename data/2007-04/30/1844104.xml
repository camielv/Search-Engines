        <p>And now, more entries from the legislative bad behavior blotter.</p>
        <p>For starters, there was Assemblyman Mike Cole's admission last week that, after a night of drinking last month, he had slept on the floor of an Albany apartment where a 21-year-old female intern lived. The incident got the intern fired and landed Mr. Cole, 35, a Republican who represents parts of Erie and Niagara Counties, in front of the Assembly's ethics committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cole said in the statement that he walked the woman home after a party on April 16 at an Albany sports bar. (The party was held by Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, a Democrat from Buffalo, in honor of Game 3 of the National Hockey League playoff series between the Buffalo Sabres and the New York Islanders.)</p>
        <p>''I ended up spending the night on her floor,'' Mr. Cole said. ''As wrong as it sounds now, at the time I didn't think it was such a bad decision to sleep there, being that I was incapable of driving. But it was. I should have taken a cab home.''</p>
        <p>There are a number of well-documented incidents of improper behavior involving lawmakers and interns, and the Assembly now has policies restricting their social contact.</p>
        <p>''At no point in time did anything inappropriate occur, nor has anything been alleged,'' said Mr. Cole, who appeared before the committee on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The panel has not announced whether it will impose sanctions against Mr. Cole.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cole, who is married and has two daughters, is serving his first full term in the Assembly.</p>
        <p>Then there was Assemblyman Karim Camara, a Democrat from Brooklyn, who was stopped last week for driving 65 miles per hour in a 30 m.p.h. zone in Albany. He ''was observed to have glassy/bloodshot eyes, slurred speech'' and ''a strong odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath,'' according to a police report. Mr. Camara failed several field sobriety tests, but he refused a Breathalyzer test, the report said. He was charged with a speeding violation, operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and refusing to take a breath test.</p>

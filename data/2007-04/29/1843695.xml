        <p>Brian Moscetti, the owner of the Soup Shoppe in Basking Ridge, is an easygoing guy. But even he has rules, or at least one rule, when it comes to ordering soup: no cellphones (or no soup for you!).</p>
        <p>At this strip-mall shop, which seats 30 (with extra seating outdoors when the weather permits) and is packed at lunchtime, a small note politely asks customers to refrain from talking on their phones while placing orders at the counter. This request is not only civilized, but also necessary: you can't have distractions when making the important decision of what to have for lunch. A half-dozen of the Soup Shoppe's more than 60 soups are available daily.</p>

        <p>At this strip-mall shop, which seats 30 (with extra seating outdoors when the weather permits) and is packed at lunchtime, a small note politely asks customers to refrain from talking on their phones while placing orders at the counter. This request is not only civilized, but also necessary: you can't have distractions when making the important decision of what to have for lunch. A half-dozen of the Soup Shoppe's more than 60 soups are available daily.</p>
        <p>There are comforting choices, including chicken noodle, split pea and Black Angus beef chili (turkey chili, too). The cream of zucchini and mushroom soup is silky, while the turkey and rice soup is more like bisque. The three-bean and Asian dumpling soups are hearty, while the carrot ginger and tomato basil soups are light. A pint of soup served with a crusty roll and piece of fruit costs $5.25 to $7.25; for heartier appetites it can be paired with a salad, sandwich or wrap.</p>
        <p>The barbecue pork and country potato salad wrap ($6.25) is a must-try; the tanginess of the sauce is tempered by the creamy mayonnaise. Hot and cold daily sandwich specials, like grilled cheese with tomato and bacon on focaccia, are also served ($7.50 with a cup of soup). You can create your own salad, with the usual toppings, but there are appealing specials like the tropical chicken salad with basmati rice, mangoes and pineapples tossed in mango vinaigrette ($8.50). If you don't have room for dessert, you can buy a chunky chocolate chip cookie or a slice of homemade carrot cake to go ($1.75 to $2.25).</p>
        <p>Soup Shoppe, 665 Martinsville Road, Basking Ridge; (908) 604-2000. Open Monday to Friday, 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Saturday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>

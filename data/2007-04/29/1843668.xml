        <p>Italian delicatessens are more commonplace in Connecticut than nutmeg trees. Yet among these legions, Liuzzi Cheese, in North Haven, manages to stand out. It's so well stocked, you may feel like you're gaining weight just scanning the labels of its many, many products from Italy and beyond.</p>
        <p>As its name suggests, Liuzzi carries a great range of cheeses, with the three-year-old Parmigiano-Reggiano ($10.99 per pound) a perennial favorite and a sharp provolone ($7.99) also popular. French, German and Dutch varieties are featured as well, and of the numerous goat cheeses, a Spanish Garrotxa ($14.99), is especially noteworthy, as are Natural Valley's raw goat Wisconsin ($17.99) and robiola Bosina, an exquisite goat-cow blend ($9.29 per piece).</p>

        <p>Italian delicatessens are more commonplace in Connecticut than nutmeg trees. Yet among these legions, Liuzzi Cheese, in North Haven, manages to stand out. It's so well stocked, you may feel like you're gaining weight just scanning the labels of its many, many products from Italy and beyond.</p>
        <p>As its name suggests, Liuzzi carries a great range of cheeses, with the three-year-old Parmigiano-Reggiano ($10.99 per pound) a perennial favorite and a sharp provolone ($7.99) also popular. French, German and Dutch varieties are featured as well, and of the numerous goat cheeses, a Spanish Garrotxa ($14.99), is especially noteworthy, as are Natural Valley's raw goat Wisconsin ($17.99) and robiola Bosina, an exquisite goat-cow blend ($9.29 per piece).</p>
        <p>But Liuzzi is about more than just fromaggio, as evidenced by a deli case stocked with 20 types of olives, store-grilled eggplant ($8.99 a pound), marinated mushrooms, five different preparations of artichokes ($3.99 to $5.99), marinated anchovies ($14.99) and a multitude of cold cuts, including imported prosciutto ($8.99), mortadella ($3.99) and store-cooked roast beef ($7.99).</p>
        <p>Beyond the racks of pastas, olive oils and dried legumes, what sets Liuzzi's apart are a mouth-watering array of take-home entrees, like a delectable ham pie ($22 for a 40-ounce serving), spinach lasagna ($3.99 a pound), chicken Marsala ($6.99) and homemade meatballs ($6.29). Additionally, there are fresh-frozen pastas, including a pesto ravioli ($7.99), gnocchi ($2.99) and manicotti ($7.99 for two pounds).</p>
        <p>Among the fresh cuts at the butcher counter are London broil marinated in honey, orange juice, ginger and spices, and veal stuffed with spinach, prosciutto and provolone. Liuzzi's also carries great cannoli (50 cents to $1.25, depending on size), as well as filbert-larded fig cake and Italian Torrone nougat (both priced at $6.99 per pound).</p>
        <p>Liuzzi Cheese, 322 State Street, North Haven; www.liuzzicheese.com or (203) 248-4356. Open Monday to Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>

        <p>Oleg V. Deripaska, the second-richest man in Russia, further pushed the boundaries of his automobiles-to-aluminum empire last week when his holding company, Basic Element, bought 30 percent of the Austrian construction company Strabag for $1.6 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deripaska, 39, a former nuclear physicist, along with the other Russian billionaires known as oligarchs, is making ever-bolder forays outside Russia. In recent years, Basic Element has snapped up assets from Guyana to Britain.</p>
        <p>At home, the oligarchs' fortunes are more uncertain. President Vladimir V. Putin is pursuing policies of state ownership in oil, automotives and aerospace. Mr. Deripaska, however, remains exceptionally well connected -- no small matter to the banks underwriting his billion-dollar deals. Forbes estimates his worth at $16.8 billion, behind only Roman A. Abramovich. As an example of his proximity to power, analysts of the oligarchy have pointed out that Mr. Deripaska is married to the step-granddaughter of the late former President Boris N. Yeltsin; Mr. Deripaska has played down the tie as irrelevant to his business activities. In any case, Mr. Deripaska did not play a public role in the funeral last week for Mr. Yeltsin.</p>

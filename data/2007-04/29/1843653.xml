        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''The Infinite Variety of the Lady Stanwyck'' [April 22], Terrence Rafferty writes that Barbara Stanwyck excelled at playing ''a woman men just can't seem to get a fix on.'' Andrew Gerle and I spent the last five years trying to get a fix on Ann Mitchell, her reporter in ''Meet John Doe.'' Ann ruins lives, but Stanwyck somehow keeps you on her side. In adapting the film for a stage musical, we agonized over Ann's likability until we realized it's the moral ambiguity that makes Stanwyck's characters worth spending several hours, or five years, getting to know.</p>

        <p>The writer is the lyricist and a book writer of ''Meet John Doe.''</p>

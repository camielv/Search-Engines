        <p>JOHN ANDERSON stood at the base of a 60-foot cliff in Allamuchy Mountain State Park, mapping out a route along the bumps and crevices on the rock face that were barely visible to anybody but a climber bent on using them as holds on the journey up.</p>
        <p>''Left foot up, left foot up,'' he called to Rob Alexander, the climber who was attached to the end of the rope he held, which was anchored to an oak tree at the top of the cliff. ''You're close. You see the move?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander saw it, but he couldn't quite make it, and he scuttled back down to the ground to let another climber try. A turkey vulture circled above, the Musconetcong River glistened below, and the view might have easily passed for New Hampshire, except for the office building peeking above the treeline in the distance, and the muffled throb of Route 80 beyond the next ridge.</p>
        <p>It was a treasured spot for Mr. Anderson, and a familiar role: trying to help a fellow climber find a better hold on the rock. He started climbing more than 30 years ago, as a boy in West Milford, and for much of the last two decades he has been fighting for better access in a crowded state that has plenty of rock cliffs like this one but has traditionally been skittish about letting people do anything more than look at them.</p>
        <p>''There should be equality and parity,'' said Mr. Anderson, 44, of Mt. Holly, who is statewide coordinator for a climbers' group called Access NJ. Two years ago, the group won an important victory from the state Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the state parks and forests. Instead of buying a $50 permit and providing proof of insurance, as they had to before, climbers now need only sign a liability waiver.</p>
        <p>This spring Mr. Anderson was lobbying for something more lasting. The department was reviewing its administrative code, as it is required to do every five years, and he asked that all restrictions on climbing, including the waiver requirement, be dropped permanently.</p>
        <p>''The law's a dumb law -- do away with it,'' he said. ''Hikers don't have to do it, bike riders don't have to do it. Why climbers?''</p>
        <p>But the code is about to be readopted without the changes he wanted. ''We do intend to further review and analyze the policy,'' said Dana Loschiavo, a department spokeswoman, leaving open the possibility of future negotiations.</p>
        <p>Rock climbers are necessarily persistent and patient, and Mr. Anderson plans to keep pressing until the state's policy more closely resembles that of the National Park Service, which permits rock climbing without restrictions at the Delaware Water Gap. He is also trying to convince some of the more restrictive county park systems, like Hunterdon's, that climbers are not reckless daredevils who chip away at crags with pitons and hammer bolts into cliffs.</p>
        <p>A few weeks earlier, Rob Alexander said, he had been climbing a 20-foot cliff in a Hunterdon County park when two rangers summoned him down. ''They told me I could get 30 days in jail and a $1,000 fine and they could take all my stuff. They followed me all the way out of the park.''</p>
        <p>But that, Mr. Anderson explained to him, was progress. ''A year ago they would have given you a ticket,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander craned his neck to survey his route for another attempt at the cliff, then hooked back up to the rope.</p>
        <p>''Step out to the left onto the face again,'' Mr. Anderson called up. ''I got you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson used to climb as many as 300 days a year, working just enough shifts as an emergency room technician to put gas in his Nissan Sentra for trips to the Catskills and the White Mountains, even the Grand Tetons and the Canadian Rockies. But almost 20 years ago, when he was 25 and just about to leave for several months in the Himalayas, he received a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. He never made the trip.</p>
        <p>He is the co-owner of a poultry export company now, shipping containers full of frozen chicken to Russia and the Middle East. He is also a partner in a group that has proposed a hovercraft ferry between Philadelphia and Baltimore. He limits his climbing to cool days in spring and fall; the heat dulls the senses in his feet and hands and throws off his balance.</p>
        <p>''Go to your right now,'' he told Mr. Alexander, who had gotten past the overhang that had stopped him on his earlier attempt. ''It's a bit dicey there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alexander -- who is 20 and a student at Warren County Community College, planning to become a teacher -- was moving fast now, nearing the top.</p>
        <p>''Touched,'' he shouted when he reached the anchor at the top. ''O.K., coming down.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Anderson held onto the rope until his fellow climber was safe on the ground again.</p>

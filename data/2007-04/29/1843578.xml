        <p>THE BASICS</p>
        <p>This new Embassy Suites hotel isn't actually in downtown Fort Myers, but near the airport in Estero, about a bowshot down Corkscrew Road from Interstate 75. There are more than 185 hotels in the Embassy Suites chain, and they all hew to roughly the same design. This one, which opened last June, is seven stories of anonymous two-room suites built around an open atrium. The manager serves drinks in the lobby each evening and, each morning, food-service professionals are there to cook you an omelet. A pool is out back, neither immense nor tiny, with a small hot tub next to it. The two bodies of water are set on a deck above a slough where alligators would probably be happy to swim. There are a small gym and a huge parking lot. The views from the rooms offer slash pine and saw grass, giving way to a tire shop, an Arizona Pizza Company, an Applebee's. In the distance, the Interstate hums.</p>
        <p>THE LOCATION</p>
        <p>Almost exactly between downtown Fort Myers and Naples, and an easy ride from the airport by shuttle bus, the hotel sits at the end of a growing business corridor along Corkscrew Road between Interstate 75 and Route 41, two miles west.</p>
        <p>THE SCENE</p>
        <p>Business travelers flying in and out of Southwest Florida International Airport, visitors to Florida Gulf Coast University, hockey players in town to play the Florida Everblades at Germain Arena and perhaps the odd water-skier bound for the ponds outside the Miromar Outlets mall on the east side of the highway.</p>
        <p>THE ROOMS</p>
        <p>The suites, you mean! Each front door opens onto a living room replete with a couch, a coffee table, an easy chair and a library desk, itself with a comfortable office chair and a couple of hardbacks for visitors. The color scheme recalls Tommy Bahama clothes, bland fluorescence, ''The Office'' TV show. A galley kitchen follows (microwave, wet bar, college-student refrigerator), with a bathroom off to one side. The bedroom is beyond that: not large but comfortable and, with the curtains drawn, dark and peaceful.</p>
        <p>THE BATHROOM</p>
        <p>Tile floors lie beneath a tub and showerhead, a toilet, a long bar with a single sink in it, a mirror the size of a full sheet of plywood. The water has that soft Everglades tang to it -- sulfur and decay combined. It's not completely unpleasant.</p>
        <p>THE AMENITIES  There are the pool and the wee gym. There are a 32-inch flat-screen TV in the living room and another big television in the bedroom, with standard cable offerings and an extensive on-demand movie library. Wi-Fi Internet access is available throughout the hotel. There's an ice machine down the hall no matter what floor you're on, and USA Today comes to your door.</p>
        <p>ROOM SERVICE</p>
        <p>You'll need to go down to the lobby for breakfast and, presumably, you could take your omelet (or biscuits and white gravy) back up to the room on a tray. But from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., the hotel's Eagle's Nest Cafe will send up Florida fare at a reasonable price: grouper sandwiches, ribs, almond fried brie, paella and vodka.</p>
        <p>THE BOTTOM LINE</p>
        <p>You have to stay somewhere. And this somewhere has centrality and firm bedding to its advantage; it's an easy hop up or down the highway to Naples, Fort Myers, Immokalee or Cape Coral. There is a state historic site down the road, too, Koreshan, which offers fine walking and a number of campsites along the Estero River. You can hang out there until the mosquitoes and humidity get to you. Then it's off to the Eagle's Nest for cold beer and the latest from ''SportsCenter.''</p>
        <p>Standard suites are $159 to $339. Embassy Suites Fort Myers-Estero, 10450 Corkscrew Commons Drive, Estero, Fla.; (239) 949-4222; www.fortmyersembassy.com.</p>

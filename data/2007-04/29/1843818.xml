        <p>Some sad news, I'm sure you've heard. The former president of Russia, Boris (Buy Me a Drink) Yeltsin, has passed away. He left behind a bar tab of $3.2 billion.</p>
        <p>In a speech Sunday, before a church group, San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom said that he is going to make San Francisco a sanctuary for illegal immigrants so they can go there and not worry about being deported to their home country of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The story that has rocked show business: Rosie O'Donnell announced that she's leaving ''The View.'' The sad part: None of the other hosts on ''The View'' heard what she said because they were all talking at the same time.</p>
        <p>President Bush sent out an e-mail today asking people to send money to the Republican Party. How come those e-mails never get deleted?</p>
        <p>David Letterman</p>
        <p>Were you aware of the fact that George W. Bush is in town? He attended a big fundraiser on Park Avenue. It's part of his pet program, ''No Cash Left Behind.''</p>
        <p>The mayor of New York City, Mayor Bloomberg, has announced that he wants to plant a million trees in New York City. A million trees in New York City. Or as Donald Trump calls it, a blight on the landscape.</p>

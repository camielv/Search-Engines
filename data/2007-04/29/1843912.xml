        <p>A suicide bomber struck at a political rally here, killing at least 28 people and narrowly missing Pakistan's interior minister, Aftab Khan Sherpao, and his son in the North-West Frontier Province on Saturday, officials said.</p>
        <p>Forty people were wounded, some critically, in the blast, including government officials and security officers, a security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation. He added that the death toll might rise because it was difficult to identify remains.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherpao was knocked down by the blast, but suffered only cuts and bruises to his legs. ''It was a miracle that I survived,'' he said in an interview at his Peshawar home on Saturday evening. ''Clearly I was the target.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''The impact was massive. The impact caused me to fall, and then there was black smoke.''</p>
        <p>State television showed the minister being helped to a car after the blast, his white hair disheveled and his clothes spattered with blood. Television news channels showed grisly images of the blast site, with mutilated bodies lying on the ground.</p>
        <p>The bomber detonated his explosives just as Mr. Sherpao ended his speech and was walking to his car, as the call for evening prayers was sounding. Two men of the minister's security detail stopped the bomber as he approached and were killed in the explosion, news agencies reported.</p>
        <p>President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan called Mr. Sherpao on Saturday night to express his concern. ''This is part of the game, and this will not break our resolve to fight terrorism,'' Mr. Sherpao said he told Mr. Karzai.</p>
        <p>He continued: ''I suffered minor injuries but my sympathies, thoughts and mind are with those colleagues who have expired. I have a lot of sympathy with their relatives and children. It is an incident that we all condemn and I want to exploit it politically. Our resolve, God willing, will continue,'' he said in comments shown on the state television channel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherpao said that he had also been the target of a suicide bombing attempt in February. The police intercepted a telephone call by the would-be bomber, who did not carry out the attack because he did not get the explosives in time, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherpao said the bomb attack would have occurred at a political rally on the anniversary of the death of his elder brother, Hayat Muhammad Khan Sherpao, who was killed in a bomb blast on Feb. 8, 1975, while addressing students at Peshawar University. ''This has happened in our family before,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and its prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, condemned the attack on Saturday. General Musharraf is in Turkey, where he is holding talks with Mr. Karzai. Each man has continued to accuse the other of not doing enough to fight terrorism. Mr. Sherpao, who is from the same Pashtun ethnic group as Mr. Karzai, has been an important interlocutor between the presidents.</p>
        <p>Suicide bombings have escalated sharply in Afghanistan over the past 18 months, and the Afghan government has repeatedly warned that the bombers are being trained and indoctrinated in camps and militant establishments in Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherpao did not speculate about who was behind the bombing attack. Pakistan has also suffered from suicide bombings; Al Qaeda-linked militants, who have sought refuge in the mountainous tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan, are thought to be behind most of them.</p>
        <p>Some of the suicide bombings in Pakistan over the past few months have appeared to be sectarian attacks, but others have focused on government and military targets, apparently in revenge for airstrikes on militant camps and compounds in the tribal areas.</p>
        <p>On Friday, an explosion that intelligence officials said was caused by an airstrike from an American drone aircraft killed four people in a compound in Waziristan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherpao has been a firm supporter of the government policy to combat terrorism, and has denounced suicide bombings and those who train the bombers.</p>
        <p>In December 2003, General Musharraf narrowly escaped injury in two bombings 11 days apart in Rawalpindi; 17 people were killed in the second bombing. Officials blamed Al Qaeda for both attacks.</p>
        <p>In July 2004, a suicide bombing that Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for was directed at Mr. Aziz, the prime minister, in Islamabad a few weeks before he took office. Mr. Aziz was unhurt, but nine others, including his driver, were killed.</p>

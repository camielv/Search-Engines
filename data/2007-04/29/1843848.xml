        <p>I LIVE in an old house on the main street of this North Carolina county seat, population 6,162, about 40 miles northwest of Raleigh. It's a rural place still, I guess, but things have been changing ever since the Old South turned into the Sun Belt and, even more so, since Money magazine wrote up our area last year as one of the five best places in America to live. What's it like to be ''discovered'' after 250 years?</p>
        <p>A quick walk down King Street tells the tale.</p>
        <p>Whatever you need, the Dual Supply hardware store has got it -- though the proprietor, Wesley Woods, may be the only one who can find it on the crowded shelves, which have looked ''pretty much the same'' ever since he started working here at ''8 or 9 years old, putting up stock, sweeping and changing tires.'' He's not worried about the big-box stores going up down by Interstate 85: ''Your people are your business, and my people aren't going away.''</p>
        <p>True, there's a steady stream in and out as a contractor, John Shoneman, picks up a couple of pounds of nails and ''just writes it down.'' Other customers ''pay so much per month.'' There's no computer.</p>
        <p>Across the street we find Evelyn Lloyd's little family drugstore, which she opened in 1987 after years of working alongside her daddy, Allen Alexander Lloyd, in the James Pharmacy. They had a soda fountain back at the James, Evelyn says, and sold gift sets of Evening in Paris at Christmas. ''Daddy knew everybody -- anybody who needed help,'' she said. ''If they couldn't pay, that was O.K.'' Evelyn's father was on the town council for 30 years; she has served for 16. She worries about the problems that have come with development. ''We're forcing people to move out,'' she says. ''Where are they going to go?''</p>
        <p>Nestled between her pharmacy and Carolina Game and Fish (featuring a sign in the window for its Turkey Contest, entry fee $15, along with hunting bows, fishing tackle, camouflage clothing and bright orange hats) we find Cup a Joe, with its latte, cappuccino, chai and multiply pierced baristas, doing a thriving business. Even more sophisticated is the authentic patisserie two doors down, owned and run by Eric Valour, recently of Lyon, France. We ain't quaint no more.</p>
        <p>I join Mayor Tom Stevens for coffee in Cup a Joe, his ''morning office.'' The Wooden Nickel bar is his afternoon office. Everybody seems to like Tom, a longtime resident who ran for office because he ''had a sense that this town was on the verge,'' and he wanted Hillsborough to ''be successful in a way that is good for human beings.''</p>
        <p>He touts Hillsborough's ''authenticity,'' deriving from its small-town character and its strong heritage -- from Occaneechi Native American roots to its Revolutionary and Civil War history, to the jazz singers, mill workers and farmers of the last century. ''We're in good shape, with a 40 percent business base and 3.3 percent unemployment rate,'' and he touts our vitality, with a newly vibrant street life epitomized by the monthly ''Last Friday'' festival featuring barbecue, bluegrass and blues.</p>
        <p>But the mayor wonders how to ''create a sense of belongingness for everybody,'' especially everybody in the big new suburbs outside town. Bulldozers are rumbling in every direction. ''We are under huge development pressure,'' says the mayor. ''Now we have to choose our future, and we have to do it right.''</p>
        <p>Up Churton Street, at Tony's Barbecue, the Price brothers, Donny and Lee, aren't so sure about all this. Like the Dual Supply, Tony's has stayed the same ever since anybody can remember, serving the best sausage biscuits in town -- some say in the entire South -- for $1.09 apiece, or 2 for $1.79, made from scratch every day. I like to get mine with mustard on it.</p>
        <p>''They're going to mess up Hillsborough'' is Donny's opinion about all the new and planned development. ''They're tearing down woods and running off the deer,'' he says. ''It's driving the country out.''</p>
        <p>Lee agrees. ''You can kill somebody and get away with it if you've got enough money,'' he says. ''It ain't nothing to build something.''</p>

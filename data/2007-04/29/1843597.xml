        <p>THE BOOKS, a duo of New Yorkers-turned-New Englanders, make quiet bricolage folk songs that sound as if they'd crumple if you touched them. They use daily-life sound samples, including a lot of talking voices on tape behind their own real-time sung voices. The result is meticulously structured and right on the edge of wispy, but it glows with a feeling of solitary effort. And it's hard to pin down in the spectrum of current music, too, which makes it feel just right for WORDLESS MUSIC, a concert series aiming to please and divert both modern classical and rock audiences. Opening for the Books is the contemporary chamber trio REAL QUIET. Monday at 7:30 p.m., New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, wordlessmusic.org; $20</p>
        <p>The collaboration between the saxophonists KENNY GARRETT and PHAROAH SANDERS has been good for both. With Mr. Garrett's mastery of patterns and paradigms -- he is a hero figure for jazz students -- and Mr. Sanders's supernatural free-jazz roar, they cover a huge amount of ground in one 90-minute set. Of course, everything relates in some way to John Coltrane, who is Mr. Garrett's idol and was Mr. Sanders's employer in the mid-'60s. But it's not just a Coltrane-repertory show, and it has a lot of ways of becoming raw and exciting. Wednesday through Sunday, Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $35 to $40.</p>

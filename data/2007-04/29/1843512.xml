        <p>SHERWIN--Cynthia Lynn, 33, died Thursday, April 26, 2007. Cindy suffered a brain aneurysm while biking, an activity she loved. She was an ardent and experienced tri-athlete and was in training for her first Ironman competition. Cindy was the beloved daughter of Richard and Margot Sherwin and Elaine and Earle Schaller. She is survived by her sister Lauren Sherwin, brother and sisterin-law Jeffrey and Amanda Sherwin, grandmother Sylvia Roberts, a large extended family of loving step-sisters and brothers including Jessica DaSilva, Julie Augur, Linda Schaller, Joseph Schaller, Matthew Schaller, William Schaller and her partner, Seth Timen. Cindy was a passionate health and fitness advocate. She graduated from Staples High School in Westport, CT, and earned a B.S. in Motion Science from the University of Michigan. Her interest in the fields of health and wellness led her to certification as a Registered Dietician and later, Masters Degrees in both Applied Physiology and Nutrition Education from Columbia University. Cindy was so much more than the sum of all her degrees and athletic accomplishments. She was, a warm, loving, caring and empathetic person who was beautiful both physically and spiritually. A foundation is being established in Cindy's name to support a wide range of health and wellness issues. Donations should be sent to: The Cindy Lynn Sherwin Memorial Foundation, c/o: Mr. Richard Sherwin, 182 Leetes Island Road, Guilford, CT 06437.</p>

        <p>KELLIE MORRISON knocks on doors for a living. As a location scout, she is responsible for finding places suitable for filming. And because it gets more expensive to film the farther you get from Manhattan -- thanks to travel time and union costs -- her best tool is a map.</p>
        <p>Twenty minutes north on the Hutchinson River Parkway, Ms. Morrison knocked on the door of a striking 4,000-square-foot, 45-year-old house in Eastchester in March 2005. The homeowners, Robert Ballasedis, 44, a salesman, and his wife, Jean, 42, not only answered, but also agreed to rent their house for ''The Namesake,'' a feature film directed by Mira Nair that opened March 9.</p>
        <p>Their decision to rent their house for 53 days earned them $40,000 -- far less than it would have cost the movie's makers to build a set.</p>
        <p>The movie is based on the popular novel of the same name by Jhumpa Lahiri, about a Bengali family that moves from Calcutta to the United States. The novel was set outside Boston, while the movie takes place in Queens and Westchester.</p>
        <p>''I was kind of excited,'' said Mrs. Ballasedis, the mother of Robert, 5, and Christine, 4. ''No one really ever sees the back end of it, how a movie actually gets made.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks after Ms. Morrison's visit, the many changes needed to turn the home into a film set began. It took three weeks, five days just to make the kitchen look 30 years old, the film's period. The hand-painted stencils in the kitchen were covered with bricklike wallpaper, and the cabinets were painted bright cobalt blue or covered in wood-grained contact paper. A metal dish rack that hung from the ceiling -- typical in Indian homes, said the film's production designer, Stephanie Carroll -- was ordered from India.</p>
        <p>''I used the whole house as if I'd built it,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''We changed everything.''</p>
        <p>The family's belongings, from the refrigerator to Mrs. Ballasedis's treasured collection of porcelain and crystal, were put in storage while the family took a three-week vacation. The living room (now beige again) was painted a brilliant scarlet and the hallway gray. Only an Air France coffee cup, which made it into the film, stayed behind.</p>
        <p>''The main thing is that it fits the kind of house the characters would have lived in at the time,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''We wanted a cul de sac. We needed a large house with enough room for the crew, and I needed the lines of home to be really clean. Bengalis are very minimal in their tastes. They're very intellectual.''</p>
        <p>Westchester won out for another reason -- the recently expanded Empire State Film Production Credit program, which is available to filmmakers whose budgets are more than $3 million and who use sets in New York or those who film 75 percent of their production in the state.</p>
        <p>''A year earlier, we might well have looked at New Jersey,'' said the film's producer, Lydia Pilcher. ''We did scout different areas.''</p>
        <p>The credit lowered the film's production costs by $600,000, a significant saving on their $10 million budget, she said. Westchester, which has been the setting of many films over the years -- like ''Big,'' ''A Beautiful Mind'' and ''The Good Shepherd'' -- is ''a great place to go to get the necessary scale,'' Ms. Pilcher said. ''If you need a small-town feel, many towns in Westchester give you that intimacy.''</p>

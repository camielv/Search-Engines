        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average broke through the 13,000 barrier for the first time on Wednesday and kept going. By the close of trading on Friday, it had reached 13,120.94, a new record.</p>
        <p>Corporate earnings that outstripped Wall Street expectations helped fuel the advance, despite some troubling economic data. On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic product in the first quarter grew at an annualized rate of 1.3 percent, much lower than in the previous quarter. And inflation, as measured by the G.D.P. price index, surged at a 4 percent annualized rate.</p>

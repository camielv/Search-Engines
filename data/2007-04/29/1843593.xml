        <p>It's FRANK STELLA season at the Met.</p>
        <p>While primarily known as a painter, Mr. Stella has also been making free-standing sculpture for public spaces and developing architectural projects since the 1990s. These works range from an aluminum band shell, built in downtown Miami in 1999, to a monumental sculpture installed outside the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 2001.</p>
        <p>Starting on Tuesday, the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART will focus on this body of his work in an exhibition called ''Frank Stella: Painting Into Architecture.'' The show, in the museum's Kimmelman Gallery, will feature works ranging from small models to a full-scale portion of a building. The architectural elements will be accompanied by a selection of paintings, wall reliefs and sculpture. Through July 29, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.</p>
        <p>In a separate show opening at the same time, the Met is presenting Mr. Stella's stainless-steel and carbon-fiber works in the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden. The artist produced a series of dense abstract sculptures composed of found and cast elements. The two exhibitions mark Mr. Stella's first solo presentation at the Met. Through Oct. 28 (weather permitting).</p>
        <p>In Boston, THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS is turning its attention to EDWARD HOPPER with a major retrospective that opens next Sunday. The exhibition -- which includes 50 oil paintings, 30 watercolors and 12 prints -- focuses on the period from 1925 to midcentury, when the artist produced many of his best-known works, including ''Nighthawks,'' ''Chop Suey'' and ''Lighthouse and Buildings.'' The show was organized with the National Gallery of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago. Through Aug. 19, 465 Huntington Avenue, Boston, (617) 267-9300, mfa.org.</p>

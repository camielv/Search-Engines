        <p>Glenn Mercer letter, citing April 8 letters, comments on two different kinds of travelers</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor: I was amused to read in the April 8 Travel section two particular letters from brave Times readers. One suggested that recovery from jet lag takes one day per hour of difference in time (so a New Yorker returning from India would need at least one week to recuperate), and another insisted that nothing short of demolition would remove all traces of cat dander from a hotel room. If this keeps up, some may find it impossible to leave their apartments.</p>
        <p>It seems travelers are bifurcating: there is the hardy adventurer who wants to climb a Tibetan mountain in her bare feet, dining only on local rodents, and the insulated capsule dweller, who can't tolerate the tea that is 5 degrees too cool. It must be a challenge to serve both types.</p>

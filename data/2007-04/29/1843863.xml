        <p>Re ''When You Meet an Imus,'' by Bob Morris (Age of Dissonance, April 22):</p>
        <p>As a criminal defense attorney, dealing with racial prejudice is important in jury selection. I was taught to ask a series of questions about prejudice and bias: Ever heard an ethnic joke? Ever told one, or have one told about your ''kind'' while you were present? The follow-up questions about what they might have thought about it and why they picked on a particular group, led to other questions: When you heard it, and didn't like it, did you say anything about it? When you said it, did anyone tell you it wasn't funny?</p>

        <p>The answers I got from the overwhelmingly white, older jury -- this was in an upstate rural county, and cases involved black state-prison inmates mostly from New York City -- provoked much discussion and, I believe, opened the eyes of potential jurors to the insidious nature of how prejudice can infect our lives. And by being a little more aware, I think we were able to select fairer and less-biased jurors.</p>

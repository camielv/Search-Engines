        <p>Faced with complaints of censorship from students, Yale University last Monday reversed a ban on the use of realistic-looking prop weapons in plays. The university imposed the ban on April 19, in response to the shootings at Virginia Tech.</p>
        <p>The Yale Daily News, a student newspaper, reported that two plays made changes last weekend. ''Red Noses'' used wooden swords, while ''Orpheus in the Underworld'' used swords made of balloons.</p>
        <p>Helaine S. Klasky, a Yale spokeswoman, said the university would go back to its original policy of allowing realistic-type prop weapons on a ''case-by-case basis,'' with the approval of the deans' office.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to do what we've always done, which is to uphold freedom of expression,'' she said. ''We are an institution that stands for that.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Klasky said audiences would be warned if a prop weapon was being used, either by a message in the playbill, signs or an announcement.</p>
        <p>Leah Franqui, 19, a sophomore from Philadelphia and the director of ''Accidental Death of an Anarchist,'' which was scheduled to open Friday at the Nick Chapel, said the ban amounted to censorship. ''I feel the administration just caved because of the media, and not because they realized there was a censorship issue at hand,'' she said.</p>

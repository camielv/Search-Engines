        <p>The flight was to last a day, a night and another day, whereupon I would reach Australia's southwest shore. Were I a resident of the Antarctic peninsula, this would make for a sensible vacation spot. I am not, but my girlfriend has relatives who retired in the vicinity, and they were paying for the trip.

        <p>The flight was to last a day, a night and another day, whereupon I would reach Australia's southwest shore. Were I a resident of the Antarctic peninsula, this would make for a sensible vacation spot. I am not, but my girlfriend has relatives who retired in the vicinity, and they were paying for the trip. If somebody offers to pay, I'll go pretty much anywhere -- GuantÃ¡namo, Los Angeles, Hell. Being a cheapskate isn't all fun and games.</p>
        <p>My girlfriend and I boarded our new home gingerly. Because I am a gentleman, and also because I had lost a game of rock-paper-scissors, I had bequeathed the aisle seat to my girlfriend. This meant I would be flanked on one side by a loathsome stranger. My seatmate approached, a broad-shouldered man who smelled as if he woke up without time to shower because he had to wrestle a hog before leaving for the airport. I flashed him my best ''like me -- just don't talk to me'' smile and buried my nose in a book.</p>
        <p>As the plane began to taxi, I checked my cellphone one last time. Suddenly, the man turned to me.</p>
        <p>''You have reception!'' he declared. ''My phone is dead -- can you send a text message for me?'' I seized on this opportunity to ingratiate myself with the man, who would then spend the ensuing 32 hours owing me a favor. Magnanimously, I punched in his message informing his employer that he had boarded the flight. Then he gave me the phone number, which began with a 0 and ended somewhere near the outermost decimal places of pi. My face dropped.</p>
        <p>I had neglected to inform the man that I am a cheapskate. It's just not the kind of thing you say right off the bat. ''Hi, nice to meet you -- I own special scissors with which I cut coupons.'' Or, ''Hello -- when dinner companions order appetizers and drinks, I recoil, knowing that their gluttony is jacking up my tax and tip.'' Now, nightmarish visions of my future cellphone bill flooded my mind.</p>
        <p>I apologized to the man, begging the limits of my paltry domestic phone plan, and was caught off guard when he persisted.</p>
        <p>''I can pay you!'' he demanded. ''I'll give you $5!'' Desperation dripped from the man's every word, as if he were a teenager quarreling with her parents about a desired piece of denim. A flight attendant approached, warning me to switch off my phone; with seconds to spare, and no real alternative, I sent his message. A glow of heroism enveloped my body, and also a glow of wanting my $5.</p>
        <p>To a cheapskate, few English-language sentences resonate with the wickedness of, ''Sorry, but I only have 20s.'' It's basically saying, ''I have too much to give you anything.'' The man barely had to glance inside his wallet before nonchalantly divulging this piece of information. And what did he care? His message had been sent. I'd been rooked!</p>
        <p>Have you ever buzzed a stewardess's call-button during takeoff and asked if she had change for a 20? They do not take this well. Other things I can now attest are not cool on an airplane: leaning over your seat and asking a passenger if she can change a $20 bill when she is in the formative stages of sleep; opening the overhead compartment when the seat-belt sign is illuminated and frantically searching your carry-on luggage while loudly cursing; angrily yelling, ''You never have any cash!'' at your girlfriend, who already appeared out of your league even before you revealed yourself as a cheap, yelling bastard.</p>
        <p>By now, my defaulting seatmate was deep in conversation with the aging hippie to his left, no doubt about the best places around for not buying deodorant. In a blink, I had gone from texting savior to niggardly fool, doomed to travel to the end of the earth in the company of a perfect stranger who already hated me. The man seemed shocked, appalled even, when I pulled together the $15.</p>
        <p>''May I ask where you are from?'' he said. I told him New York, and I could see my reflection in his widening eyes. Devil's horns were protruding from my head.</p>
        <p>I thought about all the conflicts and misperceptions in the modern world -- about how, as we flew to Australia, I had the chance to become a veritable ambassador from the United States, blessed with the opportunity to dispel damaging stereotypes held by the global community. With the tiny gesture of forgiving this trivial debt, I could forever affect one man's worldview. I recanted, coolly informing my pushy neighbor not to worry about the money, and made a friend for the long voyage.</p>
        <p>Oh, wait -- that's not what happened. This is: I took his $5 and with it received a dirty look; later, when I asked if the flight's Owen Wilson film was worth watching, he pretended not to hear me. For two weeks, I walked Australia's handsome waterfront, staring into the mighty ocean and fretting about the $50 text-message charge that was surely waiting for me back home. When I returned to New York and learned that the message actually cost 14 cents, I threw my arms in the air like a big jerk, rejoicing in my $4.86 profit.</p>

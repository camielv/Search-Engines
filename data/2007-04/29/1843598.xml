        <p>Broadway is missing lots of things these days -- decent comedies, low prices and impressive new American plays, to name just a few -- but there is no shortage of brilliant leading actresses. In the next few weeks, no fewer than five major stars will open in new productions, guaranteeing a crowded field in the best-actress categories for the upcoming Tony Awards.</p>
        <p>In addition to Angela Lansbury (a four-time Tony winner) and Marian Seldes (one Tony) in ''Deuce,'' and Audra McDonald (four Tonys) in ''110 in the Shade,'' there's TONYA PINKINS (one Tony) and DONNA MURPHY (two Tonys), both playing formidable wives. In ''RADIO GOLF,'' the final drama of August Wilson's 10-play series, Ms. Pinkins, who was last seen on Broadway as the maid in ''Caroline, or Change,'' is the partner of a rising political star who hopes to be the first African-American mayor of Pittsburgh. In ''LOVEMUSIK,'' a new musical, Ms. Murphy brings to life Lotte Lenya, who was married (twice) to Kurt Weill (played by Michael Cerveris). Weill's music makes up the score to this new work, staged by Hal Prince. ''Radio Golf,'' in previews, opens May 8, Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200; $31.25 to $96.25. ''Lovemusik,'' in previews, opens Thursday, Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200; $76.26 to $101.25.</p>
        <p>Time is running out for you to see CHRISTOPHER SHINN'S ''DYING CITY,'' an ambitious, taut drama set in the shadow of the Iraq war, featuring superb performances by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher. Act fast, because after Sunday it's gone. 3 p.m., Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; $75.</p>

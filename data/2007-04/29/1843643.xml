        <p>I resent the guilt trip laced behind the Ethicist's advice to ''find another way to do your fair share for the health-care community of which you are a member and from which you benefit'' (April 15). Because I do not wish to have residents or interns present during my examination does not mean I haven't done my fair share by paying my (staggering) medical-insurance premiums or by waiting for what often is an interminable amount of time for my appointment.</p>

        <p>I need the precious one-on-one with my doctors so that they and I may have a confidential and attentive session to discuss, diagnose and treat my ills. Why didn't the doctor provide a form (what's one more?) at the first appointment to cover a request to have residents present so that the rules, and my preferences, are clear before the game (examination) starts? I'm sorry, but I need to be the sole focus of my exam, and I don't need to be chided for insisting that I am.  D. J. Listort  Newburgh, N.Y.</p>

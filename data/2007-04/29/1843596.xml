        <p>Last fall there was widespread agreement -- and some surprise -- that Daniel Craig, in ''Casino Royale,'' was the best James Bond in a while. It is also generally agreed that no Bond could surpass Sean Connery, who owned the franchise in its first decade.</p>
        <p>And while I wouldn't necessarily dissent from either consensus, there will always be a special place in my affections for the suave, silly, overblown Bond adventures with Roger Moore. ''THE SPY WHO LOVED ME,'' the best of these, was the first Bond movie I saw in a theater and also one of the first movies to blow me away with its visual and sonic extravagance. In my memory, that Carly Simon theme song played continually for months, though I don't remember if I actually bought the single or just heard it on the radio.</p>
        <p>''The Spy Who Loved Me'' will be shown on Wednesday at Film Forum as part of its generous ''VINTAGE 007'' program, which started Friday and will continue through May 17. The Moore and Connery schools are well represented, but what lifts the series above the level of basic-cable weekend marathon is a sidebar, called '' '60s Spies A-Go-Go,'' consisting of lesser-known films that, while not technically James Bond movies, partake of the 007 gestalt of globe-trotting espionage, swordsmanship and superior haberdashery. These range from the Italian horror maestro Mario Bava's crazy ''Danger: Diabolik'' (1968) to Martin Ritt's wrenching and melancholy adaptation of ''The Spy Who Came in From the Cold'' (1965), starring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom, which gives off an existential, political chill far deeper than one of 007's martinis. 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212) 727-8112, filmforum.org.</p>

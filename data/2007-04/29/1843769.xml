        <p>THE hairstyles of celebrities and politicians are always on trial. Witness the public lashing received by the presidential candidate John Edwards for spending $800 on two haircuts, or the frenzy that ensued after Britney Spears lopped off her famously blond tresses.</p>
        <p>And last week, as Phil Spector, the music producer known for his larger-than-life locks, went on trial in Los Angeles for the 2003 murder of the actress Lana Clarkson, he emerged with a new and provocative hairdo. It looks like a cross between a Carnaby Street shag and Florence Henderson circa ''The Brady Bunch.''</p>
        <p>''Some of his advisers probably told him he should change his look, but people are going to judge him for making such an obvious change,'' said Joel Warren, the chief colorist and an owner of the Warren-Tricomi salons in Manhattan. ''I don't know whether it will work for or against him.''</p>
        <p>Even among rock stars known for outré hairdos, Mr. Spector's mane has always been a heavyweight contender. From his origins in the 1950s as a performer in the Teddy Bears to his work in the 1960s with the Beatles and in the 1970s with Cher, he has used his hair -- whether freaked out or combed over-- as a metaphor for his evolving persona.</p>
        <p>''Phil Spector is one of those people like Don King or Donald Trump who tries to get attention by having an unusual hairstyle,'' Mr. Warren said. ''It works for them, but whether it looks good is another story.''</p>
        <p>With the help of Mr. Warren, an experienced intrepreter of hair trends, we followed the timeline of Mr. Spector's tonsorial hits and misses.</p>

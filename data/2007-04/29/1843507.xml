        <p>ROSTROPOVICH--Mstislav. On behalf of America's orchestras, the American Symphony Orchestra League mourns the loss of Mstislav Rostropovich, inspirational musician, passionate advocate of music, humanitarian, and friend, whose vitality will be missed by all. Henry Fogel President &amp; CEO $(6$)ROSTROPOVICH--Mstislav. Farewell dear Slava, Tsarstvo Tebe Nebesnoye. Malko $(6$)ROSTROPOVICH--Mstislav. Curtis mourns the loss of Mstislav Rostropovich, former faculty member, beloved colleague, master cellist, conductor, and human rights crusader. Maestro Rostropovich conducted the Curtis Symphony Orchestra in memorable concerts at Philadelphia's Academy of Music and at the Rencontres Musicales d'Evian in France. In 1999 Rostropovich received the first-ever Curtis Award in recognition of his remarkable artistic and humanitarian achievements. One of the great cellists of his time, he was a friend to many of the 20th century's most important composers and writers, including prominent dissidents whom he defended publicly at significant personal cost. Curtis remembers Maestro Rostropovich with profound gratitude for the many unforgettable musical and educational experiences he provided for its students, and offers deepest sympathies to his family. Roberto Diaz, President H.F. ''Gerry'' Lenfest, Chairman The Curtis Institute of Music</p>

        <p>Connecticut last week became the first state to take action against a new high-caffeine energy drink called Cocaine -- marketed as ''a legal alternative'' -- when authorities ordered that some 300 cases be held in warehouses.</p>
        <p>The move came a week after Attorney General Richard Blumenthal threatened to sue the maker of the drink, Redux Beverages of Las Vegas, and minority groups expressed outrage at the drink's name, saying Redux was preying on vulnerable urban communities.</p>
        <p>''I was appalled,'' said Scot X. Esdaile of New Haven, president of the state N.A.A.C.P. ''Drugs like cocaine and crack have destroyed our community, not only in New Haven, but all across our country.''</p>
        <p>James Kirby, Redux senior partner and founder, while admitting that the name was chosen for shock value, disputed that it would encourage drug use. ''My drink will do less to promote the drug than the drug will to promote my drink,'' he said. ''That's just the reality of it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kirby also said his product offered an antidrug message. ''That's what the legal alternative means -- an alternative way to be cool without taking drugs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Esdaile and Alderman Robert Lee, who spotted the drink this month in a convenience store near several New Haven schools, called that claim absurd. ''I see it as people trying to take advantage of young kids in the inner city,'' Mr. Lee said.</p>
        <p>In the end, what got the drink off the shelves, at least temporarily, was not outrage, but a technicality. The drink, which began limited distribution nationally about eight months ago, had not been registered with the State Department of Consumer Protection. Mr. Kirby said that he planned to file the paperwork and said he had already made changes demanded by the Food and Drug Administration about marketing statements and nutritional claims on the company's Web site.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal said he would keep up the legal pressure. ''Marketing involving misleading and deceptive statements certainly would be one point of legal action,'' he said. ''There may be others.''</p>

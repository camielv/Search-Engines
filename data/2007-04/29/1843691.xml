        <p>Editorial calls on Westchester County and New York State officials to move toward ecologically sensitive planning, including restoration of flood-absorbing wetlands</p>

        <p>Residents who endured this spring's flooding in Westchester are about to witness the follow-up phenomenon: the outbreak of ''summit meetings,'' op-ed articles and, inevitably, flood-control studies that gather dust because their remedies are too costly and too wrenching to enact.</p>
        <p>All this bustling inaction threatens to add another layer of disappointment to what is already a federally-certified disaster. And not just any disaster -- a recurrent one that people brace for whenever the skies open up above the county's dense encrustation of highways, driveways, rooftops and parking lots, sending down torrents that cannot go where they should, and thus improvise, making lakes in basements or a rolling river between the shoulders of the Bronx River Parkway.</p>

        <p>Residents who endured this spring's flooding in Westchester are about to witness the follow-up phenomenon: the outbreak of ''summit meetings,'' op-ed articles and, inevitably, flood-control studies that gather dust because their remedies are too costly and too wrenching to enact.</p>
        <p>All this bustling inaction threatens to add another layer of disappointment to what is already a federally-certified disaster. And not just any disaster -- a recurrent one that people brace for whenever the skies open up above the county's dense encrustation of highways, driveways, rooftops and parking lots, sending down torrents that cannot go where they should, and thus improvise, making lakes in basements or a rolling river between the shoulders of the Bronx River Parkway.</p>
        <p>Nearly 20 years ago, an essay in this section by William G. Lawyer, then director of the Greenburgh Nature Center, took note of the drastic changes made to the Mamaroneck River watershed (also known as New Rochelle, Purchase, Scarsdale, Rye, etc.) An area once bound tightly to its river with mills and waterworks treated the ecosystem as an afterthought. Riverbeds shrank as highways widened. Ponds were drained for houses. Where the river was buried or walled in, it was forgotten.</p>
        <p>But some places, like Mamaroneck Village, remained where they had always been -- on low-lying ground. A month ago it would have been a stretch to mention Mamaroneck and New Orleans in the same breath. But both communities are victims of foolish planning and development. Once Mamaroneck's paperwork starts flowing, it, too, will get visitors from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. And both areas would benefit greatly from ecologically sensitive planning, including a wholesale restoration of flood-absorbing wetlands.</p>
        <p>It may be impossible to dismantle suburbia, but we should be able to improve on it, even in an area with independent, noncooperating governments. Restoring wetlands, improving drainage, banning ill-placed development, curbing sprawl -- none of this is profoundly complicated, but it does require action by leaders more used to short-term fixes and penny-wise spending. April's floods are a regional problem requiring regional solutions, and it shouldn't take any more deadly northeasters to get officials across Westchester and in Albany to tackle it together.</p>

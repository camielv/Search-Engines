        <p>Even though it's still April, the May sweeps period has begun, and this week ABC offers one of the month's most special episodes: the two-hour ''GREY'S ANATOMY'' that will serve as Kate Walsh's audition for her (that is, Dr. Addison Montgomery's) own series (Thursday, 9 p.m.). Auditioning along with her will be guest stars like Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Amy Brenneman, who will reportedly pop up when Ms. Walsh's character makes a trip to California to visit old school friends.</p>
        <p>Some other May sweepings: In an episode titled ''Rocket Man'' (NBC, Tuesday, 9 p.m.), ''LAW &amp; ORDER: CRIMINAL INTENT'' rips from the headlines the sad case, barely four months old, of the astronaut Lisa Marie Nowak. In this telling the possible romantic rival has been murdered, and the space-shuttle-piloting object of everyone's affections is played by Tate Donovan. And My Network TV, still trying to find its way after abandoning one of television's most short-lived programming strategies (telenovelas? in English?), presents ''BODY DOUBLES: INTERNATIONAL TWINS SEARCH'' (Tuesday, 9 p.m.), billed as a ''most beautiful twins'' competition. Last week in this slot, My Network TV gave us ''Ujena Bikini Jam.'' Such, apparently, is the value of prime-time broadcast real estate these days.</p>
        <p>At the higher end of the culture scale, Turner Classic Movies presents a new two-part documentary, ''BRANDO'' (Tuesday and Wednesday, 8 p.m.). Talking heads, including Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino and Edward Norton, share their memories of watching and working with the great actor (Mr. Scorsese: ''Every day cinema was being reinvented.''). TCM will also be showing eight Brando films over those two nights, including ''THE WILD ONE'' (Wednesday, 9:30 p.m.) and ''ON THE WATERFRONT'' (Thursday, 12:30 a.m.). On PBS, ''American Masters'' has a two-hour profile of the pop-music impresario Ahmet Ertegun, who died in December. ''ATLANTIC RECORDS: THE HOUSE THAT AHMET BUILT'' (Wednesday night on most PBS stations; check local listings) includes interviews with Mr. Ertegun covering a four-year period. And ''American Experience'' and ''Frontline'' have combined to produce ''THE MORMONS'' (Monday and Tuesday nights on most PBS stations), a four-hour examination of the Mormon Church's history and influence.</p>

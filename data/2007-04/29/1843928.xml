        <p>Federal regulators said last week that they intended to fine the Indian Point nuclear power plants $130,000 for failing to make an April 15 deadline to activate a new emergency siren system.</p>
        <p>The new system, mandated by an amendment to the federal Energy Policy Act of 2006, will provide backup battery power for all 150 emergency sirens throughout the region in the event of an electrical power failure, said Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the plant; the current system does not have backup power. In an emergency at Indian Point, in Buchanan, the sirens warn residents to turn on their TVs and radios.</p>

        <p>Federal regulators said last week that they intended to fine the Indian Point nuclear power plants $130,000 for failing to make an April 15 deadline to activate a new emergency siren system.</p>
        <p>The new system, mandated by an amendment to the federal Energy Policy Act of 2006, will provide backup battery power for all 150 emergency sirens throughout the region in the event of an electrical power failure, said Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the plant; the current system does not have backup power. In an emergency at Indian Point, in Buchanan, the sirens warn residents to turn on their TVs and radios.</p>
        <p>Indian Point missed the deadline primarily because in an April 12 test, 31 of the new sirens failed to be activated by radio, one of several ways in which they can be turned on. All 14 sirens in Putnam County failed; sirens are also in Westchester, Rockland and Orange Counties.</p>
        <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Entergy 30 days to submit a plan to start the new system or contest the fine. But it did not give the company a date to activate the system. ''We expect them to get it up and running in a timely fashion,'' said Neil A. Sheehan, an N.R.C. spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steets said that Entergy did not know exactly when the new system would be running but that it intended to submit a plan within the required 30 days. ''We're not anticipating a lot of new construction,'' he said. ''It's more about working through the technical circuitry.''</p>
        <p>Entergy missed a Jan. 30 deadline to activate the system, receiving an extension from the N.R.C. to April 15.</p>
        <p>Phillip J. Musegaas, a policy analyst at Riverkeeper, an environmental monitoring group, said that the commission should fine Entergy $130,000 a day, the maximum allowed, until the new system is running.</p>
        <p>''Why can't a company that makes $2 million a day running a complex power plant get this system up and running?'' Mr. Musegaas asked. ''A one-time fine doesn't set any real timetable.''</p>
        <p>The missed deadline follows a string of minor leaks, fires and technical glitches at the plants over the past year, including the sirens' loss of power last August for more than six hours.</p>

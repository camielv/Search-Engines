        <p>Jan Brenneisen, 28, from Rostock, Germany: ''I'm a professional tattoo artist, but I had never had anything to do with the text-based style of tattoos that the monks at this temple do. I was fascinated. While I was helping out during the ceremonies, calming the people being tattooed and holding their skin taut, the monk tattooed someone with a pyramid-like design. I liked it and said, 'Beautiful.' He looked at me slightly surprised. The monk said the more standard kind of tattoos like I already had were beautiful, and that the tattoos he gives were not nice looking but rather useful. Each evening after we helped the monk, he said he'd like to give us tattoos. He thought it would do us good, protect us, bring us luck. Each day I said, 'No, maybe tomorrow.' After three days, I finally said yes.''</p>

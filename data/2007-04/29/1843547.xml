        <p>IN SEARCH OF MEMORY: The Emergence of a New Science of Mind, by Eric R. Kandel. (Norton, $17.95.) A renowned scientist, Kandel has made it his life's work to show how memory and learning are encoded in the brain. (In 2000 he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.) This panoramic autobiography revisits the Vienna of Kandel's childhood -- driven out by the Nazis, he and his family fled the city for the United States in 1939 -- and gives an extraordinary overview of developments in neuroscience during the 20th century. ''If there is another book that does a better job of demonstrating how biological research is done, or of telling the story of a brilliant scientist's career, I don't know it,'' Sherwin B. Nuland wrote in the Book Review.</p>
        <p>THE TROUBLE WITH POETRY: And Other Poems, by Billy Collins. (Random House, $13.95.) With disarmingly humorous touches, this collection, by the former poet laureate, addresses the process of poetry itself, bridging the gulf between reader and writer.</p>
        <p>AMERICAN THEOCRACY: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century, by Kevin Phillips. (Penguin, $16.) Phillips, a former Republican strategist, looks broadly and historically at the political world the conservative coalition has constructed over the last several decades, identifying three trends. One is the role of oil in defining American foreign and domestic policy. The second is the intrusion of radical Christianity into politics and government. The third is the levels of debt that both the government and the American people have been accumulating.</p>
        <p>THE LAST WITCHFINDER, by James Morrow. (Harper Perennial, $15.95.) Morrow's sprawling, phantasmagorical ninth novel is a tale of rationality versus superstition, and of one woman's efforts to repeal the Witchcraft Act of 1604. The narrator, we are told, is not a person but another book: Isaac Newton's seminal ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica.''</p>
        <p>A GODLY HERO: The Life of William Jennings Bryan, by Michael Kazin. (Anchor, $16.95.) Bryan (1860-1925), the great orator and Democratic presidential nominee in 1896, 1900 and 1908, is mainly remembered as the evolution-bashing, Bible-thumping character based on him in ''Inherit the Wind.'' In this valuable revisionist portrait, Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University, sees Bryan as a powerful leader of a political-moral crusade and a pioneering advocate of progressive ideas (the right to organize, regulation of the stock market) still with us today. Our reviewer, Richard Lingeman, said Kazin ''trains a powerful searchlight on Bryan's career and the social and political trends of the time.''</p>
        <p>NAM-A-RAMA, by Phillip Jennings. (Tom Doherty/Forge, $7.99.) A former Marine captain, Jennings flew more than 300 helicopter missions in Vietnam. His satirical first novel follows two Marine pilots sent by the president on a shaggy dog of a mission either to assassinate Ho Chi Minh or to make a deal with him. ''At its best, Jennings's humor comes down like lightning,'' James Parker wrote here, ''fully charged, from some higher and more vital realm.''</p>
        <p>THE ONGOING MOMENT, by Geoff Dyer. (Vintage, $15.95.) Having already tackled jazz (''But Beautiful'') and D. H. Lawrence (''Out of Sheer Rage''), Dyer turns to photography. Studying images taken mostly from the canon of American 20th-century photography, Dyer empirically links subjects, themes and gestures, constructing a narrative history in which these images -- and their photographers -- constantly encounter one another.</p>
        <p>INTUITION, by Allegra Goodman. (Dial, $13.) Goodman's disturbing novel about life in a research institute in Cambridge revolves around a mystery. Cliff, an ambitious postdoctoral researcher, suddenly discovers a too-good-to-be-true virus that fights cancer. But his girlfriend, a postdoc in the same lab, comes to suspect he's fudged his results, which are rushed into print amid a whirlwind public relations campaign. Ably shifting perspectives among a small number of complex characters, ''Goodman has written an energetic indictment of high-stakes science,'' our reviewer, Sue Halpern, wrote.</p>
        <p>THE LOST MEN: The Harrowing Saga of Shackleton's Ross Sea Party, by Kelly Tyler-Lewis. (Penguin, $15.) While the story of Ernest Shackleton's failed Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1914 is well known, Tyler-Lewis tells the gripping tale of the Ross Sea Party, charged with laying supply depots to support Shackleton's aborted trek. Stranded when a blizzard blew their ship out to sea, 10 men battled starvation, disease and temperatures in the minus 70s for two years. In BELOW THE CONVERGENCE: Voyages Toward Antarctica, 1699-1839 (Norton, $15.95), Alan Gurney describes the many expeditions that were mounted before Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen, when the continent's existence had yet to be proved.

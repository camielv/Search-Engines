        <p>Editorial holds Gov Jon Corzine's car crash has focused attention on high number of unimportant appearances by New Jersey governors and reckless driving that gets them there; says New Jersey should quickly join other states in forbidding governors and their drivers from speeding and from using their flashing red lights, except for genuine emergencies</p>

        <p>Gov. Jon Corzine's terrible accident has focused attention on two unfortunate habits that seem endemic to New Jersey governors. One is the ridiculously high number of unimportant appearances they make around the state, and the other is the reckless driving that gets them there -- or, in Mr. Corzine's case, doesn't.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has watched New Jersey governors during the past 40 years or so cannot help but be astounded by the amount of time they've squandered racing around the state from one insignificant function to another. On many days they spent far more time in a car and at dinners, campaign fund-raisers and senior citizen events than in the office they campaigned so hard to get to.</p>

        <p>Gov. Jon Corzine's terrible accident has focused attention on two unfortunate habits that seem endemic to New Jersey governors. One is the ridiculously high number of unimportant appearances they make around the state, and the other is the reckless driving that gets them there -- or, in Mr. Corzine's case, doesn't.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has watched New Jersey governors during the past 40 years or so cannot help but be astounded by the amount of time they've squandered racing around the state from one insignificant function to another. On many days they spent far more time in a car and at dinners, campaign fund-raisers and senior citizen events than in the office they campaigned so hard to get to.</p>
        <p>On April 12, the day of Mr. Corzine's car crash, he attended the funeral of an F.B.I. agent in Pennsylvania, went to Hackensack to preside over a pact between feuding Democratic party factions, drove about 130 miles to Atlantic City to speak to a mayors' conference, and was traveling to Princeton to attend a meeting between the talk show host Don Imus and the Rutgers women's basketball team when the accident occurred.</p>
        <p>Except for the funeral of the F.B.I. agent, who had been shot while on duty in New Jersey, all of these appearances could have been dispensed with, especially at a time when mammoth tax, fiscal and social problems confront the state.</p>
        <p>Lest we put too much blame for this practice on Mr. Corzine, however, it must be noted that almost since the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway opened in the 1950s, governors have been zooming around the state to one or another political, municipal or social function, even though none of this bears any real relationship to what voters had in mind when they went to the polls.</p>
        <p>And then there's the matter of speed. Aides to Mr. Corzine's predecessors concede that their bosses, too, exceeded speed limits, even in non-emergency situations. New Jersey should quickly join other states in forbidding governors and their drivers from speeding, and from using their flashing red lights, except for genuine emergencies.</p>
        <p>There is a reasonable alternative: the helicopter. Mr. Corzine's staff apparently considered using a helicopter on April 12, but rejected the idea because of bad weather. Most New Jersey governors have avoided using helicopters since the 1990s, when their alleged overuse became a campaign issue.</p>
        <p>But a helicopter would be a far better choice than racing up and down the highways and endangering public safety. And should a governor worry that it might be hard to explain why a helicopter was used for a political meeting or any other non-essential appearance, a better alternative is at hand: stay in the office and do the job the people elect a governor to do.</p>
        <p>We sympathize with Mr. Corzine, who now faces long and arduous physical therapy. But perhaps this will give him time to rethink the priorities of his office.</p>

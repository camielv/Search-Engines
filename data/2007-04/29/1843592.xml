        <p>8 P.M. (Animal Planet) PREDATOR VS. PREY -- It's a matter of life or death -- for the prey, who must escape or become dinner, and for the predator, who must eat to survive. In this hourlong special, the zoologist Dave Salmoni, above, examines the relationship between grizzly bears and elk in Yellowstone National Park and the special skills each has developed to survive. And then Mr. Salmoni tests his own skills by putting himself in their, um, shoes.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) THE SIMPSONS -- Bart leads his Little League team to the championship game, but it's not over until the pop fly is caught -- or not. Meanwhile, a midday snooze lands Homer a job as a salesman.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) EXTREME MAKEOVER: HOME EDITION -- When Kim Collins's favorite cousin and her husband were killed in an automobile accident, Ms. Collins and her husband, Dennis, took custody of their five children. But now the Collinses' Arkansas home is splitting at the seams. Tonight, Ty Pennington and his crew give the expanded family room to grow.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (13, 49) DOGS THAT CHANGED THE WORLD: DOGS BY DESIGN -- They display the greatest diversity of any mammal, and yet, from the teensy-weensiest Chihuahua to the most overgrown St. Bernard, all dogs are descended from a common ancestor: the wolf. Part 2 of this ''Nature'' special looks at the explosion of the basic working dog types into the nearly 400 breeds recognized today, and how competitive breeding affects dogs' health and well-being.</p>
        <p>8:30 P.M. (Nickelodeon) LET'S JUST PLAY GO HEALTHY CHALLENGE -- For five years, Nickelodeon's ''Let's Just Play'' campaign has focused on children's health. Last year the network expanded the program to include specials dealing with a group of children who were challenged to eat better and exercise more and to help others do the same. Now in its second season, ''Let's Just Play Go Healthy Challenge'' expands its programming to monthly half-hour episodes that follow two 12-year-olds, Kenderick and April, above, for six months as they take steps toward healthier lifestyles. New segments include ''Workout Like a Pro,'' which features fitness tips from National Football League players, starting with Ed Reed of the Baltimore Ravens.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Food Network) $100,000 CHICKEN CHALLENGE -- Subtitle this one ''The Battle of the Bird.'' Fifty-one amateur chefs have three hours to produce their prized poultry dish for the biggest payout in the history of the National Chicken Cook-Off.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Showtime) THE TUDORS -- Henry (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, left) has trouble with alliances, both personal and political, starting with his ally Emperor Charles V, who releases their mutual enemy Francis I from prison. Meanwhile, when Anne Boleyn is offended by Henry's offer to make her his one and only mistress, it merely fuels the flame -- and his desire to marry her. Oh, she's going to regret that one.</p>

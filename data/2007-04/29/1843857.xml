        <p>Tom Glocer, chief executive of the Reuters Group, the news service company based in London, has no qualms about using the photographers on his staff as his own personal camera consultants. He recently polled three of his favorite photographers at the company to find out what would be the best camera to take on his safari to South Africa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glocer and his wife, Maarit, headed to the Singita Private Game Reserve in Kruger National Park for a long weekend in late January; they took along a Canon 30D semi-pro digital camera and lens set, as recommended by his photographers.

        <p>As for shooting any wildlife with an actual gun, he says, ''God forbid!'' ''It was really about the beauty of just seeing the animals from so close, but I brought the good camera and then really enjoyed taking photos. It's the gadget geek in me.''</p>

        <p>The Earth Mother  She recycles -- for the entire school -- and gives hand-me-downs as birthday gifts. She's going to save the earth, even if she has to ruin everybody else's day doing it. White &amp; Warren sweater-tee made of eco-friendly bamboo in white, black and terra ($90 at whiteandwarren.com).</p>
        <p>The Stepford-in-Law  Three husbands in, she's still smiling, although she's clamped down so tightly, you'd swear she was making a diamond in her jawbone. She can barely pick her grandchildren out of a police lineup, but she's always ready to pour you another Scotch. Lacoste new stretch polo with two-inch-longer hemline and five-button placket for easier fit ($75 at Lacoste boutiques).</p>
        <p>The GlamoraMa  She's gorgeous, stainless, childless-looking.  Come to think of it, shouldn't someone unleash your inner GlamoraMa? The Grace dress by the new Ella Moss Black Label collection ($380 at shopbop.com).</p>
        <p>The Sanctimommy  She does Mommy and Me yoga. She keeps track of playdates in a neat agenda. She refers to her offspring as ''munchkins.'' And you don't! Casall workout clothing ($66 to $205 at powerpilates.com). MomAgenda day planner with scheduling columns for Mom and up to four kids ($42 in pink, green, blue or chocolate at the Scholastic Store in New York, 212-343-6166).</p>
        <p>The Newly Bred  The new (or nearly) mom is the most expectant mother on the list, so note to dads: Don't botch this first Mother's Day. (P.S. Skip the romantic hotel room: She's not in the mood.) Cartier's new diamond love bracelet with a brown toile de moire strap, in stores in June, available for preorder at (800) 227-8437 ($2,550); without diamonds on a leather strap ($1,300, both at Cartier boutiques); Louis Vuitton diaper bag in pink, blue or brown monogram ($1,870 at Louis Vuitton boutiques).</p>
        <p>The Real-Life Mom  She can go from American Girl to American Idol to American Pastoral in 60 seconds. When she kisses the kids good night, she'll lie down for a little nap -- only to wake with a start at 1 a.m. and pack the lunches. From dawn to dusk, she's the star of the show. Prada gold aviator sunglasses with brown gradient lenses and tortoise arms ($265 at Bergdorf Goodman in New York, 212-753-7300). Mum's the Word pajamas by Scanty in superwashed cotton ($95 for camisole and pants set at sleepyheads.com).</p>
        <p>The Other Mother  Where would you be without nanny or Granny or the faithful neighbor, ready to step in when long days get longer? Everybody needs an Other Mother -- make sure you lavish thanks on yours. Bliss Simply the Zest Lemon and Sage Spa in a Box ($36 at blissworld.com) and Fresh Hesperides gift set ($38 at fresh.com).</p>

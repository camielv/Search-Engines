        <p>In January, Fiesta Bowl officials compared holding their bowl game and the Bowl Championship Series title game in the same week to conducting two major political conventions at once.</p>
        <p>That is the task facing New Orleans this winter, when the city will play host to the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1 and the title game on Jan. 7 in the second year of college football's double-hosting format.</p>
        <p>College football leaders came here this week for the B.C.S. meetings. They, along with Sugar Bowl officials and New Orleans politicians, said they were confident that in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the infrastructure was in place to handle the influx of tourists and other challenges presented by the games.</p>
        <p>''Every day we get stronger in our ability to handle a major event,'' Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans said. ''So those two events, back to back, we should be able to create the synergies to provide the coverage, both from a sanitation and police standpoint, and a special events standpoint to have a world-class event.''</p>
        <p>In the downtown area where the Superdome, the French Quarter and a majority of the hotels are located, there is little evidence of Katrina's devastation. Only two major downtown hotels, the Hyatt and the Fairmont, are still closed. Of the 38,000 downtown hotel rooms available before Katrina, 32,000 are open. There are more restaurants open downtown now than before Katrina, according to numbers provided by the city's convention and visitors bureau.</p>
        <p>While downtown and the surrounding areas above sea level -- known as the Sliver by the River -- may be regaining strength, they are in stunning contrast to nearby areas that many tourists do not see.</p>
        <p>''People will frolic in the streets in New Orleans and drink hurricanes on Bourbon Street and never see neighborhoods that look like an atomic bomb wiped them off the face of the earth,'' said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Tulane University. ''It's a tale of two cities, the Sliver by the River and the rest of the parts of town below sea level.''</p>
        <p>Stacy S. Head, a councilwoman for District B, which covers the downtown area, said it was unlikely that most tourists who came for the games would see the blight.</p>
        <p>''To paint a fair picture, we do have a problem in some of the devastated areas that frankly had problems before the storm,'' Head said. ''Anyone that comes to the city as a tourist, you're probably not going to know that anything happened.''</p>
        <p>In the immediate wake of Katrina, the Sugar Bowl in January 2006 was moved to Atlanta. This year's game was moved back to New Orleans, its home since 1935, and Louisiana State defeated Notre Dame, 41-14.</p>
        <p>''The people that come here will really enjoy it,'' L.S.U. Coach Les Miles said. ''Security was never an issue. Our guys were involved in every event. Our people that came to this city had great experiences.''</p>
        <p>Paul Hoolahan, the chief executive of the Sugar Bowl, said this week that he and his staff would be in a fishbowl until the games were held. ''Even in the best of circumstances, this is a tremendous challenge,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Hoolahan said that he and his staff would have to calculate how many people will be needed to pull off the games. He also said that he was going to inquire through the governor's office about the availability of state troopers, the National Guard and the highest level of security clearance for the games.</p>
        <p>''I think the key element is preparation and planning and analyzing the situation and not trying to underestimate it or overestimate it,'' Hoolahan said.</p>
        <p>Hoolahan said that the games would be important immediately and in the long term. A study released this week said that the three bowls in the Phoenix area last season brought $401 million to the local economy. Counting the New Orleans Bowl on Dec. 21, New Orleans will be host to three bowl games this winter.</p>
        <p>''The financial impact will probably be larger than the Super Bowl,'' Hoolahan said. ''That's a Band-Aid, that's not what we're looking for.</p>
        <p>''Really, what we're looking for is the ability to prove to the rest of the world that we're back and we're the can-do event city that we were. We don't want anyone to have any hesitancy, any shyness about booking their next major, major event with us.''</p>

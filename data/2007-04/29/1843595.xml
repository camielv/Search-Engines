        <p>''COMMITMENT AND GRACE: THE FILMS OF CARLOS SAURA,'' presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center through Thursday, includes five films by the Spanish filmmaker that delve spectacularly into Spanish dancing. Three -- ''Blood Wedding,'' ''Carmen'' and ''El Amor Brujo'' (''Love the Magician'') -- are collaborations with the flamenco artist Antonio Gades. Mr. Saura's 1992 ''Sevillanas'' is a primer on how to look at and film dance; no master shots for him. And his sweeping 1995 ''Flamenco'' is an ode, majestic yet intimate, not only to the dance form itself but also to a proud nation and the men, women and children who perform it, both famous and unknown. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.com; $11, $7 for members and students.</p>
        <p>One minute MARK MORRIS is opening the New York Stock Exchange and the next he is (or will be this week) directing and choreographing an opera at the Met. The work, Gluck's ''ORFEO ED EURIDICE,'' stars David Daniels and Maija Kovalevska, and opens Wednesday. This is Mr. Morris's second go at the opera, which he choreographed for a 1996 tour by the Handel and Haydn Society. And he has directed opera before, though never for the august Met. But New York City's favorite Renaissance man of modern may well give the Gluck a whole new look, with a corps that includes members of his own company, costumes by Isaac Mizrahi and sets by the Broadway designer Allen Moyer. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 1:30 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out.</p>
        <p>Excerpts from TINA CROLL'S recent ''ANCIENT SPRINGS,'' a dance of airy and mysterious beauty, joy and humor, are being performed this week in the La MaMa Moves festival. Ms. Croll's performers are wittily individual, and they share the program with the endearingly antic Yoshiko Chuma. Wednesday through Saturday, La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $15, $10 for students and 65+.</p>

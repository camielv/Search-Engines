        <p>Accustomed to Ejection</p>
        <p>With his ejection on April 22 in a game against the Mets, Braves Manager Bobby Cox has been ejected from a game as a manager 124 times, the most in baseball history.</p>
        <p>Not Just a Pretty Glove</p>
        <p>OMAR VIZQUEL of the Giants, known more for his defense (he has won 11 Gold Glove awards), is 11 hits from 2,500. Of his 2,489 hits, 2,484 have come as a shortstop, the most in baseball since 1974. San Francisco is scheduled to be home for 10 straight games starting tomorrow. The most hits by a shortstop since 1974:</p>
        <p>Good Start, Bad Start</p>
        <p>JOSH BECKETT of the Red Sox, off to a 5-0 start, is set to start against Oakland on Wednesday. He has struck out 28 while walking 7. A's designated hitter Mike Piazza is 5 for 20 in his career against Beckett without a home run. Since hitting his first home run of the season on April 5, Piazza has gone 70 at-bats without a homer.</p>
        <p>By All Appearances</p>
        <p>Trevor Hoffman appeared in his 802nd game as a Padre on Friday night, tying Walter Johnson and Elroy Face for the most appearances by one pitcher with the same team. Hoffman's 802 Padres appearances and 830 over all (28 in 1993 for the Marlins) have all been in relief. The Nationals will visit San Diego for a three-game series starting tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Watch List</p>
        <p>Cliff Lee should return to the Indians' rotation this week after throwing five scoreless innings Friday night in a rehab start, and he could unveil a new slider when he does. The Indians have not said what Lee's return means for Fausto Carmona, above, but a trip to the minors seems likely. Carmona does not project as a late-inning reliever; he failed as the closer last season, and batters are hitting .294 against him with runners in scoring position. His lone bad outing this season came with long rest, making the long reliever/spot starter role unlikely.</p>

        <p>After seven seasons as a serviceable pitcher in the American League, Ted Lilly signed a four-year, $40 million deal with the Cubs. The N.L. lineups seem to suit him. Lilly has a 2.18 E.R.A., striking out 33 in 33 innings while walking only five. He has held batters to a .178 average, including a .077 average by the seventh- and eighth-place hitters.</p>
        <p>With Salom√≥n Torres blowing three saves in explosive fashion, look for Matt Capps to finish some games for the Pirates. Capps has a 0.73 E.R.A. in 13 appearances. Of course, he gave up 12 homers in 80 2/3 innings last season, so there may still be fireworks in Pittsburgh.</p>

        <p>Of all the perquisites John E. Rooney received last year as the chief executive of U.S. Cellular, the one that may have been the most valuable did not count, according to the audit committee of the company's board.</p>
        <p>The Chicago White Sox gave Mr. Rooney one of the 432 gold-and-diamond rings they had made to commemorate their 2005 World Series championship, according to U.S. Cellular's 2007 proxy statement. On each ring, more than two karats of diamonds spelled out ''Sox'' on a black onyx face.</p>
        <p>The rings are treasured keepsakes for baseball fans, but the committee approved the gift because it was worth less than $60,000 and the company ''did not incur any out-of-pocket costs relating to this ring.'' Unless you consider the $68 million the company paid to have the team's stadium renamed U.S. Cellular Field or the additional millions it is paying to be the team's presenting sponsor.</p>

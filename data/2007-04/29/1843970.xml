        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Junior Achievement on a Major League Scale,'' April 22: The article about Dustin Satloff's SatBat, made of bamboo rather than ash, noted that Katz Sporting Goods in Meriden, Conn., was the only retailer selling it.</p>
        <p>Dave Katz, the owner of the store, seems to have an eye for talent. Katz Sporting Goods was an integral part of the Meriden Twilight Baseball League in the 1980s and '90s. In the summer of 1984, Dave and his brother Rich recruited a 16-year-old player from Puerto Rico who was attending a baseball camp in Cheshire, Conn.</p>
        <p>The young player who enthralled the locals that summer was none other than Bernie Williams. This can only portend the strong possibility that one day the SatBat, like Williams, will be a fixture in the major leagues.</p>

        <p>A New Jersey congressman may hold the deciding vote on whether a House subcommittee will reject an absurd provision that severely restricts the police from obtaining valuable information about the source of guns used in crimes.</p>
        <p>Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of Morris County is the ranking Republican member of a House Appropriations subcommittee that will consider the restriction, probably next month. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and more than 200 other mayors, including Cory Booker of Newark, are waging a television ad campaign aimed at getting Mr. Frelinghuysen and Rep. Alan Mollohan, a West Virginia Democrat and the subcommittee chairman, to support elimination of the provision.</p>

        <p>A New Jersey congressman may hold the deciding vote on whether a House subcommittee will reject an absurd provision that severely restricts the police from obtaining valuable information about the source of guns used in crimes.</p>
        <p>Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of Morris County is the ranking Republican member of a House Appropriations subcommittee that will consider the restriction, probably next month. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and more than 200 other mayors, including Cory Booker of Newark, are waging a television ad campaign aimed at getting Mr. Frelinghuysen and Rep. Alan Mollohan, a West Virginia Democrat and the subcommittee chairman, to support elimination of the provision.</p>
        <p>The measure, which has been attached to appropriations bills each year since 2003, restricts the federal government from providing the police with information about the manufacturers, buyers and sellers of illegally used guns, except in narrow circumstances when it is needed to prosecute a specific crime.</p>
        <p>According to mayors and most police chiefs, the provision is a major obstacle in their efforts to reduce gun crimes by determining where the firearms in their cities are coming from.</p>
        <p>Even though some 40 New Jersey mayors have joined Mr. Bloomberg's crime-fighting effort, Mr. Frelinghuysen has avoided saying whether he supports making the so-called tracking information generally available to police. Like the mayors, we would urge New Jerseyans to call on Mr. Frelinghuysen to do everything he can to give police access to this important data. His office phone numbers are 202-225-5034, in Washington, and 973-984-0711, in New Jersey.</p>

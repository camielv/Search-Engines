        <p>FIFTEEN months ago, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill that one expert says remains far ahead of its time: Children who need corrective eyeglasses to play sports, the law says, must wear protective eyewear, or sports goggles.</p>
        <p>The bill covers 12 sports -- whether sponsored by a school, community or government agency -- although football is not one of them. The measure passed in the Senate, 29 to 8, and the Assembly, 72 to 6.</p>

        <p>FIFTEEN months ago, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill that one expert says remains far ahead of its time: Children who need corrective eyeglasses to play sports, the law says, must wear protective eyewear, or sports goggles.</p>
        <p>The bill covers 12 sports -- whether sponsored by a school, community or government agency -- although football is not one of them. The measure passed in the Senate, 29 to 8, and the Assembly, 72 to 6.</p>
        <p>''It was very aggressive legislation, and in my opinion, it's pretty hard legislation to argue with,'' said Daniel D. Garrett, a senior vice president for Prevent Blindness America, a 99-year-old patient advocacy group based in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Ten months after the law went into effect, however, it remains unclear who should enforce it or whether it can be enforced. Some officials whose organizations seem to be covered by the law said they were not sure it pertained to them; others said they were still getting familiar with it.</p>
        <p>The law does not spell out who should enforce it, only who cannot be held responsible. Section 3 of the law reads: ''No school, community or government agency engaged in organizing, teaching, refereeing or coaching a sports activity described in Section 1 of this act shall be liable in a civil action for failure to administer or enforce the provisions of this act.''</p>
        <p>The primary sponsor of the bill was Peter J. Barnes Jr., a Democrat from Middlesex County who left his seat in the Assembly last month to become chairman of the State Parole Board. When asked who should be enforcing the law, he said: ''It is the part of the parents to make sure this is enforced. A lot of parents were buying the items for their kids anyway, regardless of the bill, regardless of the law.''</p>
        <p>So why have it?</p>
        <p>''A number of parents jumped at it and thought it was a pretty good idea,'' Mr. Barnes said. ''Somebody loses an eye, and somebody else will say, 'This is a pretty good idea.' ''</p>
        <p>For 14 years, Mr. Barnes was the director of security for the New Jersey Devils, the National Hockey League team. At the start of his tenure, he pointed out, some players did not wear helmets. When he left the Devils, players were required to wear helmets, and some wore faceguards. A rule requiring that children wear goggles seemed like a natural extension.</p>
        <p>There are more than 40,000 sports-related eye injuries each year, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, which says sports are the leading cause of eye injuries in children. The organization does not keep track of whether children were wearing glasses when they were injured.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association, the governing body for high school sports, supports the law for health and safety reasons, said Steven J. Timko, the executive director. But he also said the association has ''no responsibility for enforcing it.''</p>
        <p>Jack DuBois, an assistant director at the association, said: ''This particular bill does not pertain to high school students. It pertains to youth leagues.''</p>
        <p>When told that the law does not appear to distinguish between high school students and youth leagues, Mr. DuBois said he had not read it.</p>
        <p>''Our rules and regulations are National Federation-derived, and this is not one of their rules,'' he said, referring to the National Federation of State High School Associations, of which the New Jersey association is a member. ''It really doesn't apply to high school sports in New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>John Gillis, a spokesman for the national federation, based in Indianapolis, said it did not have any rules for wearing protective eyewear instead of eyeglasses. He said he was not aware that New Jersey had passed such a law.</p>
        <p>Not a lot of people in New Jersey seem to know much about it, either.</p>
        <p>Frank Baldachino, the executive director of the Directors of Athletics Association of New Jersey, said of the law, ''I haven't heard much about it at all.'' He referred a reporter to Gregory Ficarra, the association's president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ficarra, the athletic director at Perth Amboy High School, said he had heard about the law. He said, ''My understanding is that it trickles down to everybody, even basic phys-ed classes.''</p>
        <p>Perth Amboy does not provide its athletes with protective eyewear, Mr. Ficarra said, and as time has passed, more athletes are wearing contact lenses anyway. Promoting safety is generally a good idea, he said, but he wonders if there is such a thing as too many precautions.</p>
        <p>''There was a baseball practice here the other day, and someone made an errant throw and broke someone's nose,'' Mr. Ficarra said. ''So are we going to make every player wear a nose guard?''</p>
        <p>Robert P. Faherty Jr., the vice president and commissioner of the Babe Ruth League, a national youth baseball organization based in Trenton, said in a recent interview that he was aware of the law, but that ''the uptake has been very slow.''</p>
        <p>The Babe Ruth League, which has one million players, about 15,000 of them enrolled in Babe Ruth and Cal Ripken programs in New Jersey, has a rule that says players will adhere to all local laws and ordinances to maintain their eligibility.</p>
        <p>''I would think someone would have called and made us aware of this,'' Mr. Faherty said.</p>
        <p>But no one had called, he said.</p>

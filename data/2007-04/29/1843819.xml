        <p>A CONTRACTUAL THING</p>
        <p>The News -- Rosie O'Donnell said she would leave the ''The View'' in June after failing to agree to a contract extension with ABC.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Ms. O'Donnell has raised the profile of the morning kaffeeklatsch since joining in September and dispensing provocative views on everything from the Iraq war to Oprah Winfrey. There was also her running verbal brawl with Donald Trump. (She called him a ''snake-oil salesman,'' among other things; he called her ''disgusting,'' among other things.) Ratings rose by 17 percent. Of her departure, she said, ''That's show biz.''</p>
        <p>CASUALTY OF CORRUPTION</p>
        <p>The News -- Klaus Kleinfeld, the head of Siemens, the German engineering company and manufacturer, said he would step down in the face of a corruption scandal.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Though Mr. Kleinfeld has not been implicated, he said he would leave in September to give Siemens ''clarity about its leadership.'' Prosecutors are investigating reports that some $500 million in bribes were paid to foreign officials and that other bribes went to an Italian energy firm and a labor leader who represented Siemens workers. The scandals have shaken corporate Germany.</p>
        <p>A LITTLE TOO PERFECT</p>
        <p>The News -- The dean of admissions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology resigned after admitting that she fabricated her academic credentials.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The dean, Marilee Jones, has been at the forefront of the debate over college admissions criteria, urging stressed-out students competing for admission to elite colleges to calm down and stop trying to be perfect. In a new book, Ms. Jones warns that a ''fear of imperfection'' among students will ''stifle their creativity, impede their ability to experience joy and ultimately interfere with their success.''</p>
        <p>NEXT YEAR, SOMEONE NEW</p>
        <p>The News -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia reiterated his intention to step down when his second term ends next spring.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Russia's Constitution bars the president from serving three consecutive terms, but there have been calls by politicians loyal to Mr. Putin to set the rule aside. In his annual address to Parliament, Mr. Putin said, ''In the spring of next year, my duties end and the next state-of-the nation speech will be delivered by a different head of state.'' Mr. Putin took power in 1999 after the surprise resignation of Boris Yeltsin, who died last week.</p>
        <p>FLOATING AWAY</p>
        <p>The News -- The British cosmologist Stephen Hawking, who is paralyzed by Lou Gehrig's disease, escaped Earth's gravitational pull on a zero-gravity jet flight.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The jet flies a roller-coaster trajectory to produce periods of weightlessness. Dr. Hawking, 65, who has been in a wheelchair for nearly four decades, floated weightless eight times, each for about 25 seconds. ''It was amazing,'' said Dr. Hawking, who says he believes that humanity's survival depends on colonizing other planets. He hopes to make a suborbital flight next. ''Space,'' he said, ''here I come.''</p>

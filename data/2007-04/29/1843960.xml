        <p>OTHER fashion designers have chic, have irony, have elegance, have attitude. Cynthia Rowley has what you might call boing -- a Spring-O-Lator sense of silliness that, combined with her youthful silhouettes, bright colors and inexpensive but idiosyncratic detailing, adds up to a pretty charming whole.</p>
        <p>This is, after all, a woman who chose to take a tricked-up circus-knife-thrower's target board along when she was having her photo taken by the serious portraitist Timothy Greenfield-Sanders. She wanted to be immortalized as a lovely but nervous knife-thrower's assistant.</p>
        <p>''Well, I asked him if I could bring a prop, and he said yes,'' she explained. And instead of penning a book about her experience in fashion, she has blithely rewritten (and illustrated) her life story as a fantastical children's book cum memoir, ''Slim: A Fantasy Memoir,'' out this month from Rizzoli.</p>
        <p>So it is fitting that while the sociable Ms. Rowley is frequently happy, she is happiest bouncing on the 12-foot High Jump trampoline she has in the backyard of the West Village town house she shares with her husband and two young daughters.</p>
        <p>''It was always my dream to have one when I was little, because Pam Posey had one -- she was fancy,'' she said, referring to her best friend. ''I'm always fulfilling all these childhood dreams I had.''</p>
        <p>It certainly makes her easy to shop for. About 15 years ago, when her business was taking off, her staff pitched in and bought her a trampoline, which she installed at the house she then had in upstate New York. Three weeks later, a Harper's Bazaar photographer shot her jumping on it in a pink ball gown, and she got tangled up in the tulle and broke her arm.</p>
        <p>Undeterred, she bought another trampoline years later when she purchased a beach shack in Montauk, and recently bought another one for her Village house, where she and her daughters have had to keep their ebullience somewhat in check.</p>
        <p>''We do live in a neighborhood where you have to be kind of quiet,'' she said. ''So we're out there before school at 8 in the morning, and I'm always saying, 'Shhh.' I'm sure someone's going to complain about the giggling.''</p>
        <p>On the plus side, she finds she can see into her neighbors' backyards (and second floors) with ease. ''I can almost get up to a third-floor walk-up,'' she boasted. ''I saw a woman in her underwear, but it wasn't that interesting.''</p>
        <p>As irreverent as this suspension of all gravity sounds, Ms. Rowley has turned her colorful spirit into a major business that she owns, a rarity in fashion. But the trampoline is not a piece of brand identity. ''It's been with me my whole life -- at least, the desire to have one as a kid, and then getting it as an adult,'' she said. ''We had our wedding picture taken on it.'' Or rather, above it.</p>
        <p>And one of her favorite books is ''Philippe Halsman's Jump Book,'' a 1959 collection of photographs in which Halsman captured luminaries like Marilyn Monroe, Richard Nixon and Salvador Dal√≠ in midair. In a sudden burst of energy, Halsman wrote, explaining the jump's appeal, ''the real self becomes visible.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Rowley may argue that jumping makes her real self visible all day long. ''There's just an exuberance you get,'' she said. ''It's not like I can do a lot of tricks, but you can't help but laugh when you're jumping.''</p>
        <p>In this house, not taking things seriously is taken very seriously.</p>

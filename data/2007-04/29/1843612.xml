        <p>ASIDE from geography, Sitka, a boomerang-shaped island in the southeastern panhandle of Alaska, has very little in common with the imaginary city named Sitka conjured up by Michael Chabon in his latest book, ''The Yiddish Policemen's Union.''</p>

        <p>ASIDE from geography, Sitka, a boomerang-shaped island in the southeastern panhandle of Alaska, has very little in common with the imaginary city named Sitka conjured up by Michael Chabon in his latest book, ''The Yiddish Policemen's Union.''</p>
        <p>In this fourth novel, which comes out Tuesday, Mr. Chabon takes a historical footnote, a pie-in-the-sky proposal to open up the Alaska Territory in 1940 to European Jews marked for extermination, and asks: What if? What if this proposal, which in real life was supported by the secretary of the interior, Harold Ickes, but killed in Congress, had actually passed? What if Jews had poured into a frigid island instead of the Middle Eastern desert, and the state of Israel had never been created? What if the small settlement of Sitka had grown into a teeming Jewish homeland, a land not of milk and honey but of salmon and lumber?</p>
        <p>Mr. Chabon (pronounced SHAY-bon), tucking into a breakfast of eggs, wheat toast and reindeer sausage at Sitka's Westmont Hotel, said he took the first, unwitting step down this road-not-taken a decade ago. That's when Mr. Chabon, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 2001 for ''The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay,'' wrote a controversial essay about ''Say It in Yiddish,'' a 1958 phrase book for travelers that he found both poignant and funny. ''Where would be the most fabulous kingdom you could have taken this phrase book to, if the Holocaust hadn't happened?'' he wondered. To him, the phrase book was predicated on the ultimate ''Yiddishland,'' a place ''where you might need to say 'Help, I need a tourniquet' '' (which the phrase book thoughtfully provides).</p>
        <p>After Mr. Chabon's essay appeared, he was attacked for mocking the language and prematurely announcing its demise. He had not realized that its revered authors, Uriel and Beatrice Weinreich, wrote the book at the request of the publisher because Yiddish was spoken widely in Israel in the 1950s and in other Yiddish communities around the world. ''I had a double reaction,'' Mr. Chabon said. ''I don't like having my ignorance pointed out to me. I was embarrassed and shamed. I had the nice Jewish boy impulse that I disrespected my elders and caused pain and embarrassment. But I also felt a total sense of irritation and spite.''</p>
        <p>In Yiddish the word is ''tsalooches,'' he explained. ''Oh yeah? That offended you? Well, I'm going to write a goddamn novel, and you think that was offensive? Just wait.''</p>
        <p>It wasn't until 2003 that Mr. Chabon began to transform this momentary flight of fancy into ''The Yiddish Policemen's Union,'' a detective story in the hard-boiled style of Raymond Chandler, where the dead body and the detective both make their appearance on the first page.</p>
        <p>The following year he visited Alaska and chose Sitka (it ''sounds kind of Yiddish'') as home for the three million European Jews -- and their children and grandchildren -- his imagination saved from the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>THIS is his first trip back to the Russian-accented city since then, and while the herring boats in Sitka's harbor announce the arrival of spring, large feathery flakes of snow have been falling. Mr. Chabon is wearing Ugg boots, which keep out the wet slush but are not that comfortable to walk around in. He stops at the corner of Monastery Street, a narrow road with boxy, pastel-colored houses, and announces, ''This is where the Zamenhof Hotel is,'' a rundown flophouse that can be found only in his novel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chabon, 43 grew up in Columbia, Md., a newly formed community with a utopian flavor and very few people and houses. ''It only existed on paper,'' he explained, ''but we had this map, a project map of how it was going to be. And then it came into being as we lived there. So I got really into this early on, that you could imagine a place and it would come into being.''</p>
        <p>With Sitka, he said, ''I was just repeating what I had seen done in the town I grew up in.'' The Sitka he created is far from utopian, though. On the eve of ''Reversion'' -- when the territory is to be returned to Alaskans, and the Jews, suspended between hopelessness and oblivion, are to be kicked out -- the book's Sitka is a grim, choked place, desperate and despairing, more like Jake Gittes's Chinatown than the ''fabulous kingdom'' of Yiddishland.</p>
        <p>In reality, the 4,710-square-mile island, much of it mountains and national forest, has a population of 8,947, of which no more than 35 adults are Jewish, according to Aryeh Levenson, whose home phone rings when you dial the listing for Sitka's Jewish Community Center. But once Dr. Levenson, who works for the Indian Health Service and wears a colorful tapestry yarmulke, has alerted the tiny network, it almost seems as if we have stepped into Yiddishland. David Voluck, a Philadelphia boy who worked for the tribal bureau as a lawyer before becoming a Hasidic Jew, heard we were in town, so he called a Jewish friend, Davey Lubin, to take us out on his boat, a 28-foot aluminum cruiser built by another friend, also Jewish.</p>
        <p>The boat is named Esther G., after the grandmother of Mr. Lubin's wife, Lisa Busch. The couple met here and had the city's first Jewish wedding. They flew in bagels from H&amp;H in Manhattan. Ms. Busch is studying for her master's in Northern studies, and as we head across the inner Sitka sound, warm inside the heated cabin, she says she just wrote a paper on Mr. Ickes's resettlement plan.</p>
        <p>''No one here had ever heard about it,'' she tells Mr. Chabon.</p>
        <p>Esther G. bounces along the sound. It is snowing again, tiny hard pellets that resemble a beanbag's innards. The giant spruce that cover the island's mountains are thoroughly dusted, as if someone shook out too much powdered sugar. They match Mr. Chabon's hat, whose furry black earflaps are flecked with snow, and his few days of stubble, which shows some gray whiskers among the black. Mr. Lubin spots a few dozen brown-pointed snouts bobbing in and out of the water, sea lions, near a few glistening black seals on a rock. He is standing in the cabin doorway with a wide grin: ''This is my homeland.''</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon, we head toward the airport. At the back of the terminal, past the mounted heads of moose, ram and bear, hangs a wooden sign with a long arrow that looks as if it came from a Motor Vehicle Bureau in the 1960s, except that it points the way to ''PIE'' instead of license renewals. Follow it and you can buy the Nugget Restaurant's banana cream pie, famous throughout Alaska. In ''Policemen's Union,'' the detective Meyer Landsman is sitting with a slice when he discovers a crucial clue. Disappointingly, the only kind left when we arrive is peanut, but Mr. Chabon orders it anyway, à la mode.</p>
        <p>The Russian writer Isaac Babel is partly responsible for his writing a detective story, Mr. Chabon explains, after declaring the peanut pie pretty good. ''There was some strange kinship between Babel writing in translation and hard-boiled detective fiction, a kinship to Chandler,'' he says.</p>
        <p>For ''Policemen's Union,'' he adds, ''I felt like I had to invent a whole new language, a dialect. The thing that took the longest for me was finding the right voice. The sentences are much shorter than usual for me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chabon wrote a 600-page draft in the first person that he ended up trashing after a year. It had the same characters -- Landsman; his ex-wife, Bina Gelbfish, also a policeman; and his cousin and partner, a half-Indian, half-Jew named Berko Shemets -- but a completely different story. He feels as if ''Policemen's Union'' is its sequel, he says.</p>
        <p>For the book, Mr. Chabon dug into New York's underworld slang, filling in at spots with his own linguistic creations. A latke is a beat cop and a sholem is a gun -- a bit of wordplay, as ''sholem'' in Yiddish means peace, and ''piece'' is slang for gun in English. The powerful local mafia is made up of Hasidic Jews with payess, long curling sidelocks. Along with the rest of Alaska's Jews, they are part of what Jews living in the rest of America call ''the Frozen Chosen.''</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Chabon envisioned a ''story that would encompass many levels of society,'' he needed a character who would have access to them all. ''That's why writers have been using detectives,'' he says, mentioning Inspector Bucket in Dickens's ''Bleak House.'' Such examples haven't saved detective stories or narratives in general from contemporary disdain, he complains. ''Telling stories well is a neglected and undervalued element of what is thought to be a 'real' writer's job. There is a bias against any kind of narrative in which plot is foregrounded.''</p>
        <p>To Mr. Chabon, the detective and the writer share a bond: ''A detective suffers about a case. Writers tend to be recriminators; they go back over the same turf.''</p>
        <p>Does he?</p>
        <p>''Oh, definitely,'' Mr. Chabon says. As he goes back and refines his characters, there is always ''that sense of 'Oh, I missed something here.' ''</p>
        <p>His detective, Meyer Landsman, is like many of Mr. Chabon's protagonists, empty, disaffected men who have never quite come to terms with their (physically or spiritually) absent fathers. Landsman's damaged father, salvaged from the death camps, is brilliant at chess. He played ''like a man with a toothache, a hemorrhoid, and gas,'' writes Mr. Chabon, and helped teach ''his son to hate the game he himself loved.'' Mr. Chabon learned chess from his own father, who separated from his wife and left their home when Michael was 11. ''I was good at it, like Meyer,'' he said. ''I grew up hating it. I transferred a lot of my own feelings'' about the game to the character.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chabon, who lives in Berkeley, Calif., with his wife, the writer Ayelet Waldman, is more available to his two boys and two girls, 4 to 12, getting them ready for school, breaking from work when they return in the afternoons. As a teenager, he said, he thought a lot about what kind of father he would like to be -- unusual musings for an adolescent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chabon's novels are dominated by men, and this one is no different -- although Bina is one of his most developed female characters. Writing fully rounded, complex women, he said, ''is something I've been working on.''</p>
        <p>WITH ''Policemen's Union,'' Mr. Chabon was aiming not only for a classic detective story with a twisting, page-turning plot, but also for rich characters and detail, psychological depth and cosmic truth -- or at least cosmic questions. The book's mysteries are manifold. There is the mystery of a murder and a chess problem, the larger conspiracy it may be linked to, the fate of the Jews without a homeland, and then the ultimate mystery of existence itself.</p>
        <p>''Is there a plan for us, is there destiny or fate?'' Mr. Chabon says. ''Are we chosen? Chosen for what? Is that a good thing or a bad thing?'' Are things ''bashert'' (meant to be)?</p>
        <p>Thinking about what the world would look like without the state of Israel was ''one of the motivating impulses of writing the book,'' he says. ''How mad it seems that this tiny little scrap of land'' should be at the center of global conflicts. ''I have a very strong feeling of complete ambivalence about a world without Israel,'' Mr. Chabon says. ''I didn't come in with a point to prove or an agenda.''</p>
        <p>Whether because of that or despite it, Jews, Muslims and Christians will no doubt be able to find something in the book to hate or love.</p>
        <p>That evening, Mr. Voluck and his wife, Esther, have invited most of Jewish Sitka to their small blue bungalow to meet Mr. Chabon and have a dinner of fish tacos. Kosher, of course. (Nearly everything is flown in from Seattle.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Voluck's impish laugh contrasts with his severe black suit and starched white shirt, buttoned to the collar. The fringes of his prayer shawl hang out the back, and a black velvet yarmulke is on his head. On the wall, he points out pictures of Joseph Isaack Schneersohn and his son-in-law Menachem Mendel Schneerson, whom many within the Chabad-Lubavitch sect believe was a messiah.</p>
        <p>''I took his name,'' Mr. Chabon says, referring to Mendel, a character in the book.</p>
        <p>''I knew you did,'' Mr. Voluck responds with a smile. ''I'm on to you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chabon explains that he also used the name of the Russian town that he thinks his grandmother came from, Verbov, for the Hasidic sect that runs Sitka.</p>
        <p>Why not, says Mr. Voluck, they're your family, ''your mishpokhe.''</p>
        <p>He points to a picture on the opposite wall of his own mishpokhe, his wife's great-grandparents. Only two of 14 siblings made it out of Poland after the Holocaust. ''We're here on a thread,'' he says, ''so close to being lost.''</p>
        <p>A galley of the book has been making the rounds, and Mr. Voluck is needling Mr. Chabon about some of the plot points. But the next morning, when we meet him at the Back Door, a coffee shop behind the bookstore, he makes a point of telling Mr. Chabon how authentic and moving he found a funeral scene in the novel. ''It hit me right between the eyes,'' he says, putting a forefinger above the bridge of his nose.</p>
        <p>John Straley, a mystery author and the writer laureate of Alaska, is there, and they start talking about Babel and the language of the detective novel. ''There is a lot of Eastern European street talk that's made it into the language,'' Mr. Straley says.</p>
        <p>Those immigrants later ''created this underworld cash culture,'' Mr. Voluck responds.</p>
        <p>''A moral netherworld,'' Mr. Straley says. Mr. Chabon nods: ''I just took that one more step.''</p>
        <p>The bagels -- which taste and look like muffins -- are finished. ''I've got to go to jail,'' says Mr. Straley, who works as an investigator for the public defender's office. Mr. Chabon has to catch his plane. He is already at work on other projects. Finishing a novel is always bittersweet, he says, as he realizes ''I'm not coming back to these people anymore, that this is it.''</p>
        <p>Still, he adds, ''the world of the book still feels pretty close to me. When I was landing and the stewardess announced that we were arriving in Sitka, I had this 'What? Oh yeah, it's the real Sitka.' For so long, the only Sitka is the Sitka I made up. I forgot for a minute there was this real Sitka.''</p>

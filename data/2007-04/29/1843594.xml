      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Two exceptionally thoughtful performers are giving recitals Sunday afternoon, and it's just possible (advisable, even) to catch them both. The pianist MAURIZIO POLLINI, whose concerts invariably put familiar works in an unusual light, begins with works by Chopin and plays Book II of Debussy's Études, but the real dazzler here is likely to be his performance of Pierre Boulez's Sonata No. 2. 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $34 to $108.</p>
        <p>Around the time that Mr. Pollini leaves the stage, the soprano DAWN UPSHAW, and the pianist GILBERT KALISH, will begin the first Free for All concert of the season at Town Hall with a promising program that includes songs by Ruth Crawford Seeger, Fauré, Ravel, Messiaen, Weill and William Bolcom, and piano works by Ives (the ''Concord'' Sonata) and Brahms. 5 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, freeforallattownhall.org; free but tickets are required.</p>
        <p>The INTERNATIONAL CONTEMPORARY ENSEMBLE is devoting a program in its ICE All Over Festival to music by the inventive young composer Huang Ruo, including ''The Lost Garden,'' from the ensemble's recent recording of Mr. Huang's four chamber concertos, and the premiere of ''Atmosphere and Environment.'' Tuesday at 9 p.m., Mo Pitkin's House of Satisfaction, 34 Avenue A, near Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660, iceorg.org; $5. The festival runs through Saturday, with concerts at several halls and performing spaces in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Two composers whose music draws on pop influences are being given a spotlight this week as well. The cellist FELIX FAN and the pianist BLAIR McMILLEN will perform chamber works written for them by ANNIE GOSFIELD, and Ms. Gosfield will lead her own hybrid rock band in ''EWA7,'' a work composed for a factory in Germany. Thursday at 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $20; $25, day of the show.</p>
        <p>And JACOB TER VELDHUIS, a Dutch composer whose works have the energy of rock and the instrumentation of chamber music (plus boomboxes, occasionally) is the subject of ''Grab It: The Music of JacobTV,'' a three-concert festival. Wednesday through Friday at 8 p.m., Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (800) 944-8639, whitney.org; free.</p>

        <p>Andrew Russo: 'Dirty Little Secret'  Andrew Russo, pianist. Endeavour Classics END 1019; CD.</p>
        <p>IN a recent recital at Zankel Hall, the pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard mapped a sweeping genealogy of solo keyboard music through short compositions and excerpted movements. The program, while audacious, inspired debate, since Mr. Aimard's representation of the 20th and 21st centuries clung largely to a post-Schoenberg strain of bristling modernism, ignoring more playful alternatives.</p>

        <p>Andrew Russo: 'Dirty Little Secret'  Andrew Russo, pianist. Endeavour Classics END 1019; CD.</p>
        <p>IN a recent recital at Zankel Hall, the pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard mapped a sweeping genealogy of solo keyboard music through short compositions and excerpted movements. The program, while audacious, inspired debate, since Mr. Aimard's representation of the 20th and 21st centuries clung largely to a post-Schoenberg strain of bristling modernism, ignoring more playful alternatives.</p>
        <p>Though not intended as such, ''Dirty Little Secret,'' a new recording by the pianist Andrew Russo, serves as a useful counterpoint. Mr. Russo, whose trio Real Quiet plays on Monday evening at the New York Society for Ethical Culture near Lincoln Center, is an adventurous, entrepreneurial performer. His disc includes 14 short works by a dozen disparate composers. Most of them are united by the use of rhythms from jazz and rock.</p>
        <p>Morton Gould's ''Boogie Woogie Étude'' and William Bolcom's ''Poltergeist Rag'' provide early examples of an eclecticism that later flowered in Aaron Jay Kernis's ''Superstar Étude No. 1,'' an evocation of Jerry Lee Lewis, and the omnivorous borrowings of Derek Bermel, represented here by three pieces. Even works not literally derived from vernacular idioms, like Daniel Felsenfeld's terse, roiling ''Dirty Little Secret,'' reveal the pervasiveness of their influence.</p>
        <p>Minimalism is succinctly acknowledged with John Adams's ''China Gates,'' and Jacob ter Veldhuis's ''Body of Your Dreams'' offers exuberant melodies and rhythms derived from a fitness infomercial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russo plays everything here with technical assurance and infectious high spirits. He takes liberties with the oldest item, Scott Joplin's ''Maple Leaf Rag,'' phrasing with a perky bounce while adding cheeky ornamentation and the odd energetic sweep down the keys. Irreverent as this might seem, it is perfectly in keeping with the idiosyncratic tone of this entertaining collection.</p>

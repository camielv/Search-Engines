        <p>So the monks of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal play punk music (''Monks Who Play Punk,'' April 22). They still infringe on women's reproductive freedom by protesting at a South Bronx women's health center and trying to convince pregnant teenagers, poor women and others that it is immoral to choose not to give birth.</p>
        <p>They should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is amazing to me that men who choose a lifestyle that will never enable them to reproduce, experience fatherhood or become a husband find that they must picket outside a medical clinic to protest that most painful and serious decision of choosing not to reproduce. Instead, why don't they protest outside restaurants that don't pay minimum wages to employees trying to raise their families, or outside buildings whose owners don't repair homes that families live in?</p>
        <p>These monks have the ability to make a difference; let them not do it by castigating women.</p>
        <p>Regina Gradess  Inwood</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I would suggest to the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal that they offer to serve as godfathers for all the babies born as the result of their efforts. Besides begging for cornflakes, they can beg for diapers and formula. In between meditating, they can offer all-day child care, so the babies' mothers can earn a living. Once a week, they can host a group sleepover, so the mothers can rest, and so they can experience what it is to get up for work at 5 a.m. after a night with a crying child.</p>
        <p>As the children grow older, they can provide after-school tutoring and guitar lessons and can share their nutritious dinners with both the children and their ''emotionally, spiritually and physically'' exhausted working mothers. As each cohort of children graduates high school, they can help pay for their college educations.</p>
        <p>Once they have spent a couple of decades giving up ''bling-bling'' for the sake of those unborn babies, they will be justified in telling terrified and vulnerable young women that ''God will take care of your child.''</p>

        <p>A federal plan to redraw air routes over the coast of Westchester and Connecticut drew strong criticism at a public meeting in Stamford last Tuesday, with local residents saying they fear a decline in their quality of life and their property values from more planes flying at lower altitudes over their homes.</p>
        <p>The meeting was held by the Federal Aviation Administration and drew more than 150 people. The session, one of five public forums scheduled to take place around the region, came a month after the F.A.A. revealed its long-awaited plan for coping with airspace congestion. The administration said the plan would reduce delays at area airports like La Guardia by an average of six minutes per flight, for an overall reduction in delays of 32 percent.</p>

        <p>A federal plan to redraw air routes over the coast of Westchester and Connecticut drew strong criticism at a public meeting in Stamford last Tuesday, with local residents saying they fear a decline in their quality of life and their property values from more planes flying at lower altitudes over their homes.</p>
        <p>The meeting was held by the Federal Aviation Administration and drew more than 150 people. The session, one of five public forums scheduled to take place around the region, came a month after the F.A.A. revealed its long-awaited plan for coping with airspace congestion. The administration said the plan would reduce delays at area airports like La Guardia by an average of six minutes per flight, for an overall reduction in delays of 32 percent.</p>
        <p>Steven Kelley, the administration's manager of airspace redesign, said that he understood residents' concerns but that the agency had no control over the airline schedules.</p>
        <p>''What has changed in the past few years is the growth in air traffic,'' he said. ''We must find a way to reduce delays and improve the efficiency of the system.''</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. said it would accept public comments on the plan until May 11, come up with a final plan in August and start phasing in the changes soon after that.</p>
        <p>Robert Funicello, director for environmental projects in Westchester's transportation department, said that the county had hired an environmental consultant to analyze the F.A.A.'s plan but that the administration had been slow in releasing data on flight operations in the area.</p>
        <p>''We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke,'' he said. ''The F.A.A. said it will take five years to implement this plan, and they are giving us just one month to respond?''</p>

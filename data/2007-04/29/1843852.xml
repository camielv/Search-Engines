        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The comment of a Department of Sanitation spokeswoman that Jose Adames has never been fined for his posting of more than 20,000 posters in the past two years because, according to your April 22 article ''Frequent Fliers, and He Who Posts Them,'' ''his posters do not provide his address or telephone number, which the department requires to issue a summons,'' is both absurd and outrageous.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The comment of a Department of Sanitation spokeswoman that Jose Adames has never been fined for his posting of more than 20,000 posters in the past two years because, according to your April 22 article ''Frequent Fliers, and He Who Posts Them,'' ''his posters do not provide his address or telephone number, which the department requires to issue a summons,'' is both absurd and outrageous.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adames has been a candidate for office numerous times, and each time he has filed designating petitions with the Board of Elections that include his address. What is so difficult about one governmental agency consulting the public records of another public agency to obtain a candidate's address so it can proceed against this unsightly and illegal defacement of public property?</p>

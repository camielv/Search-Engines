        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Kudos to Clyde Haberman for pointing out the facts of congestion pricing in ''Who Pays for Driving in Manhattan?'' (NYC column, April 24). Critics of this proposal are quick to call Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg elitist and eager to repeat their mantra that this will hurt the working class and the boroughs, but the facts simply don't support this.</p>
        <p>What of the few who drive to work because nearby transit is inefficient? The $500 million a year that congestion pricing will generate for improvements and the corresponding decrease in traffic will benefit the outer boroughs just as much as it will benefit Manhattan. As the mayor said, these improvements would even begin before congestion pricing goes into effect.</p>

        <p>With improved public transit and a reduction in traffic, all New Yorkers would benefit from congestion pricing, even those who still choose to drive.</p>

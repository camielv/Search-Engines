        <p>Yale University's short-lived decision, in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, to ban realistic-looking but fake weapons from student plays was a classic case of overreaction.</p>
        <p>The administration may have meant well, but requiring students to use wooden swords in a play and find something other than a prop handgun did not do a thing to lessen violence or make the world a safer place. After all, any violence the students were prepared to engage in on stage was not real to begin with. Perhaps that's why they call it acting.</p>

        <p>Yale University's short-lived decision, in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, to ban realistic-looking but fake weapons from student plays was a classic case of overreaction.</p>
        <p>The administration may have meant well, but requiring students to use wooden swords in a play and find something other than a prop handgun did not do a thing to lessen violence or make the world a safer place. After all, any violence the students were prepared to engage in on stage was not real to begin with. Perhaps that's why they call it acting.</p>
        <p>Students were eloquent in their condemnation of the move, saying that the arts should be a vehicle to heal and inspire, leading people away from their darker selves. Their spirited protests helped persuade Yale to end the ban after a week. An attempt to be sensitive to others by engaging in sweeping censorship seemed contradictory.</p>
        <p>Rescinding the ban was a very wise move. The attempt to weed out weapons from plays looked ridiculous. ''Macbeth'' should have sword fights. Operas should have acts of revenge. And Brutus should not have to resort to using a banana to kill Julius Caesar.</p>

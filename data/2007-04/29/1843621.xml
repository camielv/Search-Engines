        <p>To the Editor: Regarding ''36 Hours: Portland, Ore.'' by David Laskin (April 15): Living in Portland's ''highly caffeinated neighbor to the north,'' I often spend time in the Rose City and can attest to the delights of staying at the quirky Kennedy School hotel. Sometimes, however, its mellow new-age livability can be overbearing.</p>
        <p>Once, I awoke at 5 a.m. to the sound of a bird aggressively chirping, seemingly just outside my window. ''Wow,'' I thought, ''that bird is loud!'' The initially pleasant but incessant warbling soon became simply annoying because I could no longer sleep.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Regarding ''36 Hours: Portland, Ore.'' by David Laskin (April 15): Living in Portland's ''highly caffeinated neighbor to the north,'' I often spend time in the Rose City and can attest to the delights of staying at the quirky Kennedy School hotel. Sometimes, however, its mellow new-age livability can be overbearing.</p>
        <p>Once, I awoke at 5 a.m. to the sound of a bird aggressively chirping, seemingly just outside my window. ''Wow,'' I thought, ''that bird is loud!'' The initially pleasant but incessant warbling soon became simply annoying because I could no longer sleep.</p>
        <p>Getting up, I accidentally leaned close to the clock radio only to realize that it was set to one of those stations that offers supposedly soothing ''sounds of nature.'' I imagined that the housekeeper had been instructed to set it at a barely audible level as a gesture of Oregon-style relaxation -- whether welcomed or not.</p>
        <p>The next morning, I overheard a fellow at the table next to mine complaining of his restless night. ''Some infernal cricket was sitting just outside my window all night long.''</p>

        <p>Jordana Harte Zakim, the daughter of Lydia and Jack Zakim of Franklin Lakes, N.J., and Justin Michael Blitz, the son of Marilyn and Bert Blitz of New York were married last evening. Rabbi Kenneth A. Emert officiated at the Metropolitan Club in New York with Rabbi Arnold Mark Belzer participating.</p>
        <p>The bride, 27, is the manager of special events for Coach, the leather goods company, for whom she produces store openings, introductions of new products and other events. She graduated from Columbia.</p>
        <p>Her father is of counsel with Nashel, Kates, Nussman, Rapone &amp; Ellis, a law firm in Hackensack, N.J. He is also the principal of Lenox Hill Investors, a firm in Hackensack, that operates commercial real estate investment and commercial mortgage subsidiaries. Her mother is an administrator for the company.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 29, is an associate with Shandell, Blitz, Blitz &amp; Bookson, a New York law firm in which his father is a senior partner. The bridegroom graduated from George Washington University and received a law degree from New York Law School.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blitz first saw Ms. Zakim in 1991 at the annual social at Point O'Pines Camp for Girls in the Adirondacks. She was 12. He was 13 and a camper at nearby Brant Lake.</p>
        <p>''I was seeing another camper at the time, and I wanted to introduce her to my bunkmate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>She did not react positively. ''I remember that I thought he was cute -- and trouble,'' she said. ''He took his friend and pushed us together.''</p>
        <p>Their paths crossed occasionally during their high school years -- he went to Columbia Prep in New York and she to Saddle River Day School in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''He definitely stayed on my radar screen, but he didn't seem like boyfriend material,'' she said.</p>
        <p>They both settled in New York after college.</p>
        <p>''I ran into him one night in the Hamptons, where he glued himself to my side,'' Ms. Zakim said. ''I was intrigued, but annoyed. I was single and wanted to talk to other gentlemen.''</p>
        <p>That night, a mutual friend died in a car accident. Ms. Zakim and Mr. Blitz each other again at the funeral and at a condolence call.</p>
        <p>It wasn't long before he asked her out. This time she accepted. ''The funeral and all the tragic events brought all our friends together, and it made me a little more reflective and emotional than usual,'' she said. ''In the wake of that, I decided to give Justin a chance and thought, 'What do I have to lose?' ''</p>
        <p>Her reservations dissipated after a few dates, she said, and they became serious after a few months. ''We were together for six years,'' she said, ''and now he is perfect.''</p>

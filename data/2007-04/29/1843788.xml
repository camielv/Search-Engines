        <p>The Moondance Diner, which opened in the 1930s, sits at the corner of Grand Street and the Avenue of the Americas, technically a SoHo address. But in spirit, the diner belongs to the grittier, motor age New York that built the Holland Tunnel, whose traffic roars nearby.</p>
        <p>The Moondance is a chromed, railcar-style place, topped by a cheddar-colored crescent moon and decorated with sequins the size of silver dollars. ''EAT,'' a 70-year-old fluorescent sign blinks in back.</p>

        <p>Fans of the Moondance Diner in SoHo, after hearing that the landlord wants to build a condominium on the site, are considering dragging the diner to a new location.</p>

        <p>The Moondance Diner, which opened in the 1930s, sits at the corner of Grand Street and the Avenue of the Americas, technically a SoHo address. But in spirit, the diner belongs to the grittier, motor age New York that built the Holland Tunnel, whose traffic roars nearby.</p>
        <p>The Moondance is a chromed, railcar-style place, topped by a cheddar-colored crescent moon and decorated with sequins the size of silver dollars. ''EAT,'' a 70-year-old fluorescent sign blinks in back.</p>
        <p>The diner has appeared in the television series ''Friends'' and in the 2002 movie ''Spider-man.'' Jonathan Larson, the creator of the musical ''Rent,'' was a waiter there for a decade.</p>
        <p>But SoHo is creeping westward; this year, the diner's landlord, Corey Shanus, made known his plans to build a nine-story condominium on the site. In response, the diner's fans are considering an option unavailable to most preservationists: pick the thing up and move it.</p>
        <p>Like many old diners, the Moondance was built elsewhere and hauled here in one piece on a trailer. With comparative ease, it could be dragged somewhere else.</p>
        <p>''I could pop it up tomorrow,'' Sunny Sharma, the beefy, jocular owner of the business, said the other day, kicking the building's base. ''I could put a car jack under this diner and run.''</p>
        <p>He was exaggerating, of course. Moving a diner can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Nonetheless, Mr. Sharma would like to buy the structure and operate it elsewhere in the city. The total tab, he said, including a new lease, would easily exceed $100,000.</p>
        <p>To help him raise some of that money, an artist and longtime customer named Ruth Litoff plans to hold an art auction in her studio on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Sharma cannot buy the diner, he would like to see someone else do so. The building is listed on the ''for sale'' page of the American Diner Museum's Web site and has already attracted three interested buyers.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people love this place,'' Mr. Sharma said. ''Humans die. But this material, we still can save it.''</p>

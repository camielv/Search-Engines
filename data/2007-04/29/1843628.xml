      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Robinson's Tea Room near the village green in Stony Brook is as dainty as a dollhouse, with 12 chintz-covered tables and garlands of silk gardenias draped over the lace curtains. Loretta and James Vertucci, the owners, have a ''Shelf of Fame'' where teacups used by visiting celebrities like Yoko Ono have been retired and displayed; there is also a collection of teapots for sale.</p>
        <p>Robinson's offers more than 80 varieties of fresh-brewed teas, which range from delicate Jasmine Blossom to robust French caramel crème brûlée. The full British afternoon tea service ($23) includes unlimited tea -- you may sample more than one flavor -- which arrives with a tiered rack containing scones, tea sandwiches and pastries. Your choice of scone (cinnamon, raisin or orange-cranberry), comes with fresh clotted cream and raspberry jam. The assorted tea sandwiches include shrimp, tuna, ham, cucumber and turkey, along with a miniature quiche. The desserts are a custard and fruit tart, a white chocolate mousse tart and a rolled pirouline cookie with hazelnut cream.</p>

The children's menu has a few playful surprises: mixed in with the grilled cheese and chicken nuggets is a nutella-and-marshmallow-fluff sandwich ($5, served with juice or a little pot of tea).</p>
        <p>An individual pot of tea (two to three cups) à la carte is $3, a large pot (six cups), $5. Cakes and scones are also sold à la carte, and loose tea is sold by the pound ($16 to $34).</p>
        <p>Reservations are essential for the afternoon tea, although breakfast and lunch patrons are seated first come first served.</p>

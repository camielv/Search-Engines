        <p>Anna Leigh Kaplon, a 14-year-old wearing shiny braces and a silver horse charm necklace, stood near the barn door of the Claremont Riding Academy on Tuesday afternoon watching a half-dozen horses trot around its 4,900-square-foot riding arena.</p>
        <p>''I've been crying for the past two days,'' Anna Leigh said. ''I haven't slept. I've missed a couple days of school.''</p>
        <p>Kat Mallary, 12, said that after hearing that the venerable stable on West 89th Street would soon close, ''I burst into tears and called all my friends.''</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of us barn rats,'' she added. ''We're coming here as much as we can now.''</p>
        <p>Katie Brannick, a rosy-cheeked eighth grader who has been riding horses at Claremont for a year, simply dabbed her eyes with a paper towel and pursed her lips.</p>
        <p>Such was the bittersweet scene at the stable last week after the news spread that the only remaining public stable in Manhattan, which opened in 1892 and became a riding school in 1927, would close today.</p>
        <p>Paul Novograd, the stable's owner, said that the closing ''was not a decision that was arrived at easily.'' It resulted, he said, from financial pressures and the declining usefulness of Central Park's 4.25-mile bridle path, which in recent decades has become crowded with joggers, cyclists, dog walkers and stroller pushers.</p>
        <p>He declined to say what will happen with the building that houses the stable, a four-story Romanesque Revival landmark that was built in 1892 and that his father, Irwin, bought in 1943. Most of the stable's approximately 40 horses will be distributed among Mr. Novograd's riding school in North Potomac, Md., his home in Roscoe, N.Y., and Yale University's equestrian program.</p>
        <p>The stable's instructors made phone calls to break the news to their students, who streamed in during the week for what Mr. Novograd called ''farewell rides.''</p>
        <p>One of them was Francesca Meldrum, a first grader at Marymount School with long blond hair and six missing teeth. Francesca, who was finishing her last lesson at Claremont, shyly volunteered that ''I know how to walk and trot and canter.'' Next up in her repertoire of gaits is learning to gallop, for which, her mother, Chantal Meldrum, said, she will be shuttled to the Riverdale Equestrian Centre in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Francesca said a sad goodbye to some of her favorite horses, including Jimmy, a 9-year-old black thoroughbred, and Bambi, a 30-year-old dun mare who has carried generations of Manhattan riders.</p>
        <p>''The attachment can be very emotional,'' said Mr. Novograd, walking up and down among the building's original stalls amid sorrowful children in half chaps and riding helmets. ''People are heartbroken.''</p>

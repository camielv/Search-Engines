        <p>RECENTLY, high school students in Wilton tried to stage a play they had written titled ''Voices in Conflict,'' about the war in Iraq. The production proved controversial enough that the teenagers were forbidden to proceed.</p>
        <p>As a young adult novelist, I dealt with this scenario -- a community divided, students, parents and principal struggling with issues of free speech, education and censorship -- in one of my books. Like the Wilton case, the play in my book was ultimately staged off campus, though not at the Public Theater in New York City, where ''Voices in Conflict'' will appear in June.</p>
        <p>This is not the first time a play has been banned from school. Indeed, earlier this year, students at John Jay High School in Cross River, N.Y., just over the Connecticut border, were embroiled in similar disputes over the recitation of the word ''vagina'' in a reading from Eve Ensler's ''Vagina Monologues.''</p>
        <p>It's understandable that a play about Iraq would be deemed by some to be controversial, but plenty of fairly innocuous plays have also raised the ire of public school officials, namely the musical ''Grease'' and even classics like ''The Crucible.''</p>
        <p>But what can be staged that will offend no one? Theater's gold standard, Shakespeare, is larded with violence, betrayal, teenage suicide. If avoiding the war, vaginas and ''Grease'' is not the answer, then what is?</p>
        <p>It's a cheap shot -- if irresistible -- to mock what is a serious issue of control, of ''protecting'' teenagers from ideas deemed too adult, too offensive or explosive, for them to handle. But who decides what's O.K. for young adults to talk about onstage? Whose sensibilities (let alone politics) should prevail? Remember, these are high school students, not a troupe of commercial actors. Are there definable, perhaps even necessary, limits to maintain?</p>
        <p>Sometimes the phrase ''appropriate in an educational setting'' is used to draw the line: what's considered acceptable elsewhere may not be in a school, where the setting alone could be construed as providing an imprimatur for the ideas expressed.</p>
        <p>Writing for teenage readers, I'm exquisitely aware that I'm talking to other people's children, and that's a potentially paralyzing responsibility because that same notion of ''appropriate'' applies. But hard, saddening, maddening ideas are never going to go away, whether they're written in a book, acted out onstage or shouted at across the parking lot. So where should teenagers be introduced to these ideas? Online? In a movie?</p>
        <p>Surely a school is one of the safest, sanest places available for this struggle. Allowing free expression, even of views that we may disagree with -- especially the ones we disagree with -- would enlarge that educational setting to include real life itself, where real people act with real consequences, while acknowledging that school is indeed a special place, a neutral zone where ideas are free to battle, within parameters that insist on simple human courtesy.</p>
        <p>As adults, teachers and principals, parents and community members, we can offer young people the setting and the chance to tussle with hard concepts, to be right and be wrong -- that's called learning. It's not as quantifiable as algebra or as concrete as parts of speech, but it is surely necessary knowledge, the ability to handle and consider opposing ideas and painful realities. Today's students are tomorrow's citizens, and they must learn to disagree peacefully, if there is to be any civilization at all.</p>
        <p>So don't take the play Off Broadway, stage it in school, and then offer a forum for dissenting students to share their views, with one another, with the larger community. Assign projects that explore the disputed ideas, letting all sides make a case. Investigate other moments in history when onstage art caused a communal fuss. Rather than slam the door on dissent, open it wide: make of the controversy a useful tool, a teachable moment.</p>
        <p>We can even use it to admit that, adult or not, we don't have all the answers. I'd stand in line to watch that. Wouldn't you?</p>

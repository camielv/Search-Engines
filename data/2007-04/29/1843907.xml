        <p>Taliban insurgents released a French woman who is an aid worker in southern Afghanistan on Saturday, one of a group of five people taken hostage three weeks ago and threatened with death by the Taliban.</p>
        <p>The woman, identified only as Céline, worked for the humanitarian agency Terre d'Enfance, Afghan officials said. She was released at 9 a.m. in Helmand or Kandahar Province, driven to the NATO air base near the city of Kandahar and flown to Kabul by midafternoon, the officials said.</p>

        <p>Taliban insurgents released a French woman who is an aid worker in southern Afghanistan on Saturday, one of a group of five people taken hostage three weeks ago and threatened with death by the Taliban.</p>
        <p>The woman, identified only as Céline, worked for the humanitarian agency Terre d'Enfance, Afghan officials said. She was released at 9 a.m. in Helmand or Kandahar Province, driven to the NATO air base near the city of Kandahar and flown to Kabul by midafternoon, the officials said.</p>
        <p>''I did not meet her, but she is O.K.,'' a government official in Kandahar said, asking that his name not be used because he was not permitted to discuss the issue with the news media.</p>
        <p>The French Foreign Ministry confirmed the release of one aid worker from Terre d'Enfance but did not identify her, news agencies reported.</p>
        <p>The fate of the remaining hostages, a male French aid worker and three Afghan colleagues, remains unknown. The five disappeared April 3 in Nimruz Province in the southwest, and the Taliban later released a video showing the two French aid workers pleading for their release.</p>
        <p>The chairman of Terre d'Enfance, Antoine Vuillaume, told reporters in Paris on Saturday that the released hostage was traveling to Kabul accompanied by French authorities, Agence France-Presse reported.</p>
        <p>''Céline is extremely worn out after 24 days in captivity,'' he said after meeting with the French foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy. ''She is very weak. Clearly this is a first sign of hope. In any case, it is a first result, it is a great relief, and brings hope for the other four people.''</p>
        <p>A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, who announced the woman's release in phone calls to news agencies on Saturday morning, said she was bearing a letter from the Taliban to the French government extending its deadline for the remaining hostages for one week and demanding that France cut its assistance to Afghanistan to win their release.</p>
        <p>The Taliban are also holding five Afghan medical workers kidnapped at the beginning of April in Kandahar Province.</p>

        <p>BACON--Dr. Isaac. The Yeshiva University family deeply mourns the passing of Dr. Isaac Bacon, who served for 18 years as the fourth dean of Yeshiva College. The fatherin-law of Dr. Karen Bacon, The Dr. Monique C. Katz Dean of YU's Stern College for Women, he was a linguistic specialist and an innovative educator who left his indelible mark on YU. During his deanship, he introduced many new programs, courses and seminars at YC, including joint programs with YU's graduate programs, Columbia University, the Polytechnic Institute of NY, and Baruch College; and a cooperative program for outstanding high school students. Upon his retirement in 1977, he was appointed consultant to the Vice President for Academic Affairs at YU. Condolences to his wife, Esther, sons YU Associate Professor Dr. Joshua (and Rena), YU Professor Dr. Stephen (and Karen), and Ari (and Sari) Bacon, and to the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees</p>

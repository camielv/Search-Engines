      <block class="full_text">
        <p>AT a state budget hearing last week, Assemblyman William D. Payne, a Democrat from Essex County, asked the state commissioner of community affairs what would become of programs, including some anti-gang initiatives in his district, that had previously been financed at the request of individual lawmakers as part of the ''Christmas tree'' process.</p>
        <p>In reply, the commissioner, Susan Bass Levin, could only shrug.</p>
        <p>For years, lawmakers have earmarked dollars in the state budget for pet projects, programs and institutions -- Christmas tree items -- as part of the political wrangling that takes place annually during budget negotiations.</p>
        <p>This year, this is a sensitive topic for lawmakers because they have watched half a dozen of their colleagues get hit with subpoenas as part of a federal inquiry into how some projects get financed.</p>
        <p>In an interview after her testimony, Ms. Levin said there was not one specific budget line to dispense money for some of the programs that Assemblyman Payne was asking about, which included the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Newark.</p>
        <p>Some of the programs, she said, are financed through the state Department of Children and Families, some through the Department of Human Services and some through her own agency.</p>
        <p>Under new rules this year, lawmakers and the governor will have to submit any requests for additional spending to the Legislature at least 10 days in advance of consideration. The new rules are aimed at reducing the last-minute dickering for votes and limiting an almost surreptitious insertion of Christmas tree items into the state's spending plan.</p>
        <p>Given the state's shrinking but significant budget deficit, there is already a subdued mood among lawmakers about adding any spending items. And with Gov. Jon S. Corzine sidelined by his auto accident, the mood has become even more dour as lawmakers wonder whether, in his indefinite absence from day-to-day business, there will be any chance to negotiate shifts of spending priorities in an already tight budget.</p>
        <p>Republicans are wary, anticipating that Democrats may revert to some form of the old practice of last-minute negotiations in the budget process.</p>
        <p>It is something that Assemblywoman Alison Littell McHose, a Republican from Sussex County, said she is dreading as the clock ticks down to the June 30 deadline for adoption of the budget.</p>
        <p>''We all know that it is going to happen, and here we have a $33 billion budget that has no significant cuts from the level of spending last year,'' she said. ''Where is the money going to come from?''</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph F. Vitale, a Democrat from Middlesex County, said more money must be found in the budget to address concerns about the state's charity care fund for those people who do not have health insurance and for worthy programs that help keep teenagers from joining gangs. ''Doing those things now will cost taxpayers less money in the long run,'' he said.</p>

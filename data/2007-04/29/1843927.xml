        <p>Westchester's 9/11 memorial, ''The Rising'' -- unveiled last September at Kensico Dam Plaza in Valhalla -- is an Eiffel Tower-like sculpture with 109 intersecting steel rods reaching skyward, one for each county resident who perished.</p>
        <p>There were 110 victims, however.</p>
        <p>Michael Packer, of Hartsdale, who was speaking at a conference at Windows on the World that morning, was somehow missed, and his name was not included on the granite stones encircling the sculpture.</p>
        <p>''It came as a horrible surprise,'' said Susan Tolchin, chief adviser to the county executive, Andrew J. Spano. ''We were devastated that this person was left out. We prided ourselves on including everyone.''</p>
        <p>All the lists gathered by the county had Mr. Packer a resident of Manhattan, Ms. Tolchin said. His widow, Rekha, 52, said last week that she did not attend the memorial's unveiling, but that a friend who did told her of the omission, and Mrs. Packer said she wrote a letter to the county.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Packer said she would like her husband, who was 45 and a managing director at Merrill Lynch, to be remembered along with the other county residents. She said that she and her husband had lived in the same house in Hartsdale since 1990, but that she had not been involved with the committee of victims' family members that had planned the memorial.</p>
        <p>''I was focused on getting my children's lives back to normal,'' she said. They are Jonathan, 13, and Sarita, 16.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he was intentionally left off,'' Mrs. Packer said. ''I assume it was a very bad oversight. Nobody is to blame, and there's no one I want to blame. The issue is fixing it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Tolchin said that before the next anniversary, a new stone would be added in Mr. Packer's honor and a new sign would explain the discrepancy between the number of symbolic rods and the number of victims.</p>
        <p>''I'd like my kids to be able to visit the monument and see his name there,'' Mrs. Packer said.</p>

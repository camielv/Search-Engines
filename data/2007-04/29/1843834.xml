        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Those Young People, They're So Unpredictable'' (Week in Review, April 22):</p>
        <p>I am 18 years old, and I find some of the results of your poll of young Americans troubling. Nevertheless, I can think of a possible reason why many young people approve of the president and the Iraq war.</p>
        <p>No young American wants to believe that his or her leader and role model would fabricate an entire war for political gain and then invoke it to further policies that not only fail to address reality but also repress people who are different, or who just disagree with him.</p>
        <p>How can this be true?</p>
        <p>The answer is that we are in denial. It is very difficult to face the fact that the people responsible for our nation's welfare have made wrong decisions on our behalf. Our generation has yet to confront the fact that George W. Bush has been a terrible father to our nation.</p>
        <p>Now we need to become real men and women and stand up to him.</p>
        <p>Ben Smail  Madison, Wis., April 22, 2007</p>

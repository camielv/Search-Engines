        <p>STOP me if you've heard this one before. Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Fred Durst -- the frontman for the rap-metal group Limp Bizkit -- are sitting in the living room of a mutual friend in Los Angeles, sharing beef jerky. Mr. Durst turns toward the erstwhile frontman for the United States and says, ''Mr. President, when you were in office did you find out anything -- supernatural?''</p>
        <p>The tattooed rocker, who has sampled religions like he has sampled women, adopts the former president's cadence: ''It's funny you should ask, Fred. When we first took the White House, I had the same question.''</p>

        <p>STOP me if you've heard this one before. Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Fred Durst -- the frontman for the rap-metal group Limp Bizkit -- are sitting in the living room of a mutual friend in Los Angeles, sharing beef jerky. Mr. Durst turns toward the erstwhile frontman for the United States and says, ''Mr. President, when you were in office did you find out anything -- supernatural?''</p>
        <p>The tattooed rocker, who has sampled religions like he has sampled women, adopts the former president's cadence: ''It's funny you should ask, Fred. When we first took the White House, I had the same question.''</p>
        <p>And?  Mr. Durst, dining last Monday night at Morimoto, the Tenth Avenue outpost of Masaharu Morimoto (the Iron Chef), paused for effect (and to take a sip of very expensive sake). ''Bill told me a story about a missing family and the government hiring a psychic,'' he said. ''She came up with their latitude and longitude.'' Alas, nothing about little green men. Pause. ''But Clinton loved my mom's beef jerky!''</p>
        <p>Fred Durst, 36, apparently is a born storyteller. That is fitting, considering he is in New York to sell a story, ''The Education of Charlie Banks,'' his directorial debut, which was scheduled for its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on Friday night. (A previous cut was rejected from Sundance.)</p>
        <p>It is not what you would expect from Mr. Durst. The man behind the anthem ''Break Stuff'' has delivered a sensitive $3 million indie, a talky coming-of-age story about an awkward college student (Jesse Eisenberg of ''The Squid and the Whale''). He has the camera linger on his actors, letting them do the heavy lifting. Has Mr. Durst gone soft? ''I was a very sensitive child,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Durst, wearing a snug G-Star Raw nylon jacket, had brought along his assistant and fellow musician, Gabe Karon, 29, and Katya Valevich, a young woman from Moscow whom they met that day at a bodega near Soho House, where Mr. Durst is a member. She ordered tofu, though she had already eaten. ''I didn't think you'd call,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Durst has slimmed down since his touring days (Limp Bizkit sold upward of 25 million albums, and he ate accordingly). He proclaims the virtues of eating for your blood type (a fad diet) and rarely touches dairy.</p>
        <p>''There's milk in the tofu,'' the waiter said. Mr. Durst reached for a spoon. ''I'll try it,'' he said, ''for Russia.'' Ms. Valevich let out a hearty laugh. She proposed a toast: ''To never seeing each other again.'' It was now Mr. Durst's turn to laugh.</p>
        <p>''I get two questions from fans,'' Mr. Durst said later. ''Where's your baseball hat? And did you sleep with Britney Spears?'' The hat started to feel like a uniform, he explained. And, ahem, Ms. Spears? ''I learned not to kiss and tell,'' he said. (He has told plenty; see Google.)</p>
        <p>The group decamped to Soho House. In the elevator up to the lounge Mr. Durst asked, ''Do you want to meet my son?'' He seemed disappointed when Ms. Valevich did not answer. Still, he sent Mr. Karon to retrieve Dallas, who is 5.</p>
        <p>Mr. Durst told one last story, about waiting for Dallas to turn 3 before spoiling him. ''That's when long-term memory develops,'' said Mr. Durst, who had arranged a V.I.P. tour of SeaWorld. ''I want Dallas to remember -- in case this all goes away.''</p>
        <p>He meant the fame thing. ''At some point we might not get the V.I.P. treatment,'' he said. ''We might just get a discount.''</p>

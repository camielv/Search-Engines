        <p>Houston's selection of defensive end Mario Williams with the top overall pick in last year's draft elicited loud boos from those in attendance at Reliant Stadium.</p>
        <p>But when the Texans used the 10th pick yesterday to choose the 19-year-old Louisville defensive tackle Amobi Okoye, they were cheered enthusiastically.</p>
        <p>Okoye, a 6-foot-2, 302-pound native of Nigeria, is the youngest player to be selected in the first round since the National Football League and the American Football League merged in 1970. Okoye, who enrolled in college at 16, had 55 tackles, 15 tackles for a loss, 8 sacks and 3 forced fumbles as a senior in 2006.</p>

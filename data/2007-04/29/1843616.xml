        <p>Janaki String Trio: 'Debut'  Janaki String Trio. Yarlung Records 62376; CD.</p>
        <p>THE Janaki String Trio, formed in Los Angeles in 2005, clearly regards Krzysztof Penderecki's String Trio as its signature work. A vigorous reading of the work was the centerpiece of the group's New York debut concert early this year, and it is offered twice -- in a studio production and a live recording -- on this introductory CD. The difference between the two recorded accounts is not enormous: the live version is a hair faster and perhaps a touch wilder in spirit. Replacing one with another work would have been better. Still, it is easy to see the Penderecki's appeal to these musicians, whose repertory tilts toward contemporary music. It begins with an explosion of fortissimo percussive chords, repeated with an almost brutal vehemence. In the work's 12-minute span, its two connected movements push toward extremes of brashness and beauty and demand an interpretive flexibility to make the transitions plausible.</p>

        <p>THE Janaki String Trio, formed in Los Angeles in 2005, clearly regards Krzysztof Penderecki's String Trio as its signature work. A vigorous reading of the work was the centerpiece of the group's New York debut concert early this year, and it is offered twice -- in a studio production and a live recording -- on this introductory CD. The difference between the two recorded accounts is not enormous: the live version is a hair faster and perhaps a touch wilder in spirit. Replacing one with another work would have been better. Still, it is easy to see the Penderecki's appeal to these musicians, whose repertory tilts toward contemporary music. It begins with an explosion of fortissimo percussive chords, repeated with an almost brutal vehemence. In the work's 12-minute span, its two connected movements push toward extremes of brashness and beauty and demand an interpretive flexibility to make the transitions plausible.</p>
        <p>The Janaki players have that in spades, and they use it to even more striking effect in Beethoven's early C minor Trio (Op. 9, No. 3), which they play with sharply chiseled accents and a broad dynamic sweep that make it sound almost contemporary at times. They also move easily between the frenetic and dolorously lyrical sections of Jason Barabba's String Trio.</p>
        <p>But the ensemble's strongest quality is its energy, particularly that of its cellist, Arnold Choi, whose rich tone and muscular style are the group's backbone. His colleagues -- Serena McKinney, violinist, and Katie Kadarauch, violist -- are a counterweight to his sound.</p>
        <p>On their own, in David Lefkowitz's dark, meditative Duet for Violin and Viola, the women produce a comparatively gentle, transparent sound. Coming just before the second Penderecki performance, the Lefkowitz is also a moment of fragility, which Mr. Penderecki's pounding chords sweep away with no mercy.</p>

        <p>WHO in the world needs another duvet cover or soup tureen? Today's newlyweds often start out with plenty of household accouterments -- often more than they have room to store. With this in mind, many brides and bridegrooms are registering for gifts they can take on vacation. Some even register for the vacation itself. (It is not unusual for groups of friends to chip in on expensive presents.) So if you are stuck for what to give the couple who have nearly everything and also happen to be travel enthusiasts, there are plenty of items to buy that will provide hours of pleasure away from home.</p>
        <p>1. Inspired by safarigoers in South Africa, this rooftop tent fits onto the roof rack of a car and gives you a platform to see anything that comes your way, not only lions or elephants. There are extra awnings and canopies available to enhance the homelike feel of the tent. Tents start at $1,295; at www.hannibalusa.com or (800) 533-2210.</p>
        <p>2. The all-in-one rolling picnic cooler opens to become a table with two detachable stools; $49.95 from www.comforthouse.com or (800) 359-7701.</p>
        <p>3. The Garmin GPSMAP 76CSx is a hand-held navigator that is waterproof and includes a compass. It gives highway and street directions and can be used for hiking as well; $449 at www.llbean.com or(800) 441-5713.</p>
        <p>4. The Digital Hero straps onto the wrist and enables you to take photos or video during the most extreme sports, even in water. It weighs 4.5 ounces and costs $88 at Flight 001, www.flight001.com or (877) 354-4481.</p>
        <p>5. For beach bums, this sleek lightweight chaise longue is made of aluminum and nylon; $99.95 at Hammacher Schlemmer, www.hammacher.com or (800) 321-1484.</p>
        <p>6. For travelers who want chic luggage, without logos, there is Globe-Trotter, which has been made in Britain since 1897. An ash frame is covered by 14 layers of treated paper and trimmed in leather. The newest addition to the line is cream color with black leather trim; sizes include a 30-inch suitcase on wheels, ($2,205) and a 21-inch ($1,740) with wheels and a extendable handle ($1,570), as well as a 13-inch vanity case ($920); available at the Conran Shop, www.conranusa.com or (866) 755-9079.</p>
        <p>7. For a special honeymoon trip, an Hermès passport case made of calfskin comes in a variety of colors. Choose one for him and one for her; $2,075 at Hermès, www.hermes.com for store locations or (800) 441-4488.</p>
        <p>The Registry column, about gifts for newlyweds, will appear periodically.</p>

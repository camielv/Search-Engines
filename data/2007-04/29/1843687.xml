        <p>FEW people have ever been in a glass house, let alone thrown stones at one. Starting tomorrow, a few lucky visitors -- minus the stones -- will be able to walk through perhaps the most famous Glass House of all -- the home of the architect Philip Johnson, when it opens to the public for the first time.</p>
        <p>The Philip Johnson Glass House, in New Canaan, was built in 1949 and is considered one of the 20th century's most renowned modernistic structures. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, which was given the house by Johnson in 1986, is offering tours to 10 people at a time twice a day until the official ribbon cutting on June 21; after that, six tours will be given each day the house is open through October. (Tickets are sold out until early July.)</p>

        <p>FEW people have ever been in a glass house, let alone thrown stones at one. Starting tomorrow, a few lucky visitors -- minus the stones -- will be able to walk through perhaps the most famous Glass House of all -- the home of the architect Philip Johnson, when it opens to the public for the first time.</p>
        <p>The Philip Johnson Glass House, in New Canaan, was built in 1949 and is considered one of the 20th century's most renowned modernistic structures. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, which was given the house by Johnson in 1986, is offering tours to 10 people at a time twice a day until the official ribbon cutting on June 21; after that, six tours will be given each day the house is open through October. (Tickets are sold out until early July.)</p>
        <p>Johnson lived in the house until he died in 2005 at 98. It is made of sheets of quarter-inch thick glass that are divided and supported by black steel pillars, with a circular brick column inside that holds a bathroom and a fireplace. There are no interior walls.</p>
        <p>Robert A. M. Stern, the dean of the Yale School of Architecture, called it one of the most significant homes in the United States.</p>
        <p>''The idea of a glass house was a dream of architects for a long time,'' he said. ''The way the design was executed makes it very important.''</p>
        <p>The Glass House is 1,728 square feet and sits on 47 acres of manicured landscape, along with 13 other structures that include painting and sculpture galleries containing the works of well-known artists, a guest house, a pool and a man-made pond. Many of the other structures were also designed by Johnson and added to the property over the years.</p>
        <p>''When you're inside the Glass House, the landscape around you envelopes you and becomes kind of a three-dimensional wallpaper,'' Mr. Stern said.</p>
        <p>Amy Grabowski, the director of external affairs for the Glass House, said Johnson referred to the site as his ''50-year diary.''</p>
        <p>Tours run daily, except Tuesdays. A 90-minute tour costs $25, and a two-hour tour (during which photographs are permitted) is $40 a person. A two-hour tour led by a curator is $500 and includes a picnic lunch.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grabowski said people from Germany, Japan and Sweden had called about visiting. ''People have known about this site for over 50 years,'' she said. ''They've been anticipating this very excitedly.''</p>

        <p>Re ''For N.F.L. Draft, the Biggest (XXXXXXL) Sleeper,'' April 25: Walter Thomas may turn out to be a great player in the N.F.L., but at what price?</p>
        <p>After recent articles in The Times profiling former N.F.L. players who have Alzheimer's after sustaining head injuries, it seems absurd to put another 370-pound player on the field. The league should calculate the future medical costs of these clashing Goliaths.</p>
        <p>Then there's the issue of how many calories need to be burned to keep someone like Thomas running as fast as he does. He is probably just a little less fuel efficient than his Ford Expedition. Not that the N.F.L. will ever care about anything besides ticket prices, licensing and the cost of a 30-second ad, but the conspicuous consumption the league promotes is as antiquated as a leather helmet.</p>

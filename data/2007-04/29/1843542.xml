        <p>QUOTATION MARKS: A few weeks ago in this space, to help correct a blind spot in the new ''Yale Book of Quotations,'' readers were asked to send in favorite quotations from the works of young writers -- ''young'' being defined here as those born after 1950. The response was fairly large: more than 400 people e-mailed us or posted lines on our Web site. But the response was also a little ... scattered. Many of the quotes weren't from writers at all, or were from quite old (or quite dead) ones. So the plan to print a page of them is out the window. But this doesn't mean we can't draw a few conclusions from the submissions. One of them is: Dave Eggers, Zadie Smith, David Foster Wallace and Jonathan Safran Foer have close readers. Their books easily drew the most submissions. Another is this: Foer may be the whiz-kid Rod McKuen of his age. People are clearly taken with his warmhearted observations on life and love. The submissions from his work included these, all from ''Everything Is Illuminated'': a) ''From space, astronauts can see people making love as a tiny speck of light,'' b) ''Live so that you can always tell the truth'' and c) ''This is love ... isn't it? When you notice someone's absence and hate that absence more than anything? More even, than you love his presence?''</p>
        <p>QUOTATION MARKS II: To be fair, a number of decent quotations from other writers did turn up. Here are five that seem worth preserving in print: ''Better not to leave here than to have to come back'' (Jonathan Franzen, ''The Corrections''); ''She viewed ethnic cleansing, famine and genocide as direct threats to her furniture'' (Arundhati Roy, ''The God of Small Things''); ''I did not pan out'' (Sam Lipsyte, ''Home Land''); ''If things go a bit dodgy, ah jist cannae be bothered'' (Irvine Welsh, ''Trainspotting''); and this line, spoken by a combat photographer in Rory Stewart's ''Places in Between,'' when asked why he doesn't carry a zoom lens: ''I am the zoom.'' Big thanks to the readers who sent them.</p>
        <p>ON FIRE: Larry Brown's final, posthumous, uncompleted novel, ''A Miracle of Catfish,'' is reviewed in this issue. For Brown fans one of the joys his stuff has always provided is the music that percolates through his books -- his characters always seemed to be rummaging around on the floorboards of some pickup truck, looking for the perfect thing to pop into a tape deck. ''I've just been out in the gloam with my cousin,'' Brown wrote in his memoir, ''On Fire.'' ''We've been riding around drinking a few beers, what my mama used to call 'acting ugly.' ... It's the very best time to ride around and listen to some music. Run over snakes. We try to do it several times a week in the summer. A man's got to have a bro to run with sometimes.'' Brown knew a lot of musicians, and they salute him in fine high style on a new CD called ''Just One More: A Musical Tribute to Larry Brown.'' Alejandro Escovedo, Robert Earl Keen, Vic Chesnutt and the North Mississippi All-Stars are among the contributors, and part of the proceeds go to an educational endowment in Brown's name. It's a good thing to have with you, out riding in the gloam.</p>

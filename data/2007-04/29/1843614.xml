        <p>STAGING Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' is a notoriously treacherous proposition. A man and a woman are seized by a forbidden passion, are discovered and pay with their lives.

        <p>STAGING Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' is a notoriously treacherous proposition. A man and a woman are seized by a forbidden passion, are discovered and pay with their lives. That's it -- for three long acts, running four hours, give or take. Wagner thought of his cosmic rhapsody of love that kills not as a story set to music, but as ''deeds of music made visible.''</p>
        <p>''My worst 'Tristan' experiences have been when a director has decided to give characters something to do, no matter what,'' Esa-Pekka Salonen, music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, said on a recent visit to New York. ''I remember a production with a woman hanging laundry in the second act.'' This would be while the adulterers are spending a night of rapture discussing fine points of philosophy.</p>
        <p>The case for a bare-bones ''Tristan'' in concert form is not hard to make. Yet when Mr. Salonen decided to program the opera with his orchestra (it was to be his first full-length foray into Wagner), he went a very different route. The evolving '' 'Tristan' Project'' -- unveiled at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles in December 2004 -- does consist in part of a concert performance. But overhead, dwarfing the performers, a simultaneous video symphony unfolds, composed by the artist Bill Viola.</p>
        <p>There's plenty to see: seascapes and forests, inspired by Wagner's settings; invented purification rituals; earthly bodies and their celestial doubles, spiraling through floods and conflagrations. Footage shot on a hand-held camcorder gives way to set pieces filmed with the heavy artillery of a Hollywood blockbuster. For the third act, the wide screen rotates 90 degrees, to momentous effect. Time is elastic. Sometimes it runs backward, and water falls up.</p>
        <p>To most who have seen ''The 'Tristan' Project,'' it is the Viola ''Tristan,'' and it is major. (For the record, the director Peter Sellars is prominently credited as artistic collaborator.) It has already played Paris in two consecutive seasons and a reprise this spring in Los Angeles. Now comes the New York premiere, presented at Avery Fisher Hall on Wednesday and Saturday as part of the Lincoln Center series Great Performers.</p>
        <p>'' 'Tristan' shows the whole range of what I do,'' Mr. Viola said recently from his home in Long Beach, Calif. ''It became a crossroads in my life and work. I've always been drawn to primal stories about the human quest to achieve liberation, about striving for something beyond ourselves. So my first decision was to create a parallel image world, shifting between concrete reality and a highly symbolic state, designed to exist in the inner dimension where Wagner's music takes place. It's about the movement of human consciousness.''</p>
        <p>Love and death are opera's bread and butter; ''Tristan'' is on another plane entirely. The true story is not love as we know it but a yearning for the infinite, never to be fulfilled. (Wagner had been reading Schopenhauer.) Whole books have been written on the implications of the so-called ''Tristan'' chord. But the story, based on medieval Celtic legend, has been stripped down to nearly nothing -- just enough to provide an intelligible point of reference for the music.</p>
        <p>As usual, Wagner set his own libretto. Shortly after completing the score, he called ''Tristan'' ''was furchtbares!'': something dreadful, terrifying. ''I am afraid the opera will be banned,'' he continued, ''unless a poor performance turns it all into a joke. Only mediocre performances can save me! Really good ones would drive people mad.'' The impact of ''Tristan'' was as profound as its creator predicted, not only on music but also on the visual arts, literature, psychology, even film.</p>
        <p>The score of ''Tristan'' has a way of making any theatrical reality look cardboard, which may explain the impulse on the part of opera companies to reach beyond the usual suspects. In 1987, the Los Angeles Opera reeled in the British artist David Hockney, no novice at what he called ''painting the stage.'' Mr. Hockney's décor, in ravishing color, has shown remarkable staying power; San Francisco Opera revived it last October. (The original director was Jonathan Miller at his most contemptuous. Several others, including Mr. Hockney, have been in charge of the revivals.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Hockney's sets took the libretto and its medieval setting at face value. ''We made a storybook out of 'Tristan,' '' the artist said recently from Yorkshire, England where he was at work on a landscape he described as the most ambitious painting he has ever done. ''It's rather stuffy opera. Not much happens till right at the end. You've usually got big singers with big voices who can't move much. So where do you put the movement? In the light. There was constant movement in light.''</p>
        <p>The production was an important experiment in the theatrical use of Vari-Lite, an automated pan-and-tilt system originally developed for rock concerts. In Mr. Hockney's hands, the moving lamps washed the stage in ravishing jewel tones, but the noise they made disturbed the singers and not a few of the patrons. Mr. Hockney, whose hearing is not the best, didn't mind.</p>
        <p>How well Mr. Hockney's effects have held up is an open question. Though whisper-quiet Vari-Lite systems have since been designed, all revivals of the Hockney ''Tristan'' -- including one directed by the artist -- have reverted, wholly or for the most part, to conventional stage lighting, with uneven results.</p>
        <p>''Lighting costs a lot of money in the theater,'' Mr. Hockney said. ''To put in cues takes a lot of time. If they revive something, they give you no time. Don't I know. I didn't even go to Houston when they revived 'Tristan' there. I didn't want to see it. If someone else lit it, it's not much to do with me.''</p>
        <p>Twenty years on, he recalled the final tableau with keen enthusiasm. ''Remember the dawn? The whole cliff went dark, then you had bright light on the cyclorama. A dawn. A transcendental dawn, just at that last chord where the music lifts you up.''</p>
        <p>Untried technology was at the heart of another landmark ''Tristan'' last year, when the Staatsoper in Berlin invited the star architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron to design their first theater set. The curtain rose on what looked like a movie screen floating between broad bands of black masking above and below. Through the letterbox aperture, the audience saw a narrow walk space, backed by a concave surface of glowing white.</p>
        <p>That surface was in fact a rubber membrane stretched across a walk-in pressure chamber. As air was sucked from the chamber, the membrane took on the imprint of solid objects concealed within: ship's tackle in Act 1, steps and arches of a slowly crumbling villa in Act 2, a living double of Tristan himself in Act 3. The effect was quietly astonishing: a world willing itself into existence, then dissolving before one's eyes. If décor is all too often the director's tabula rasa, here the situation was reversed. To judge by the unfocused stage action, the director, Stefan Bachmann, left the singers to fend for themselves, and it fell to the set designers to fathom the depths of Wagner's mystery.</p>
        <p>''We didn't want to use projections, which are just light describing a fading, flickering reality,'' Jacques Herzog said recently from his office in Basel, Switzerland, discussing how the membrane made objects seem both ghostly and very physical. ''The intention was to let shapes emerge from the void, so you never really know what's real or not real. It was really interesting to think through what reality could be on the stage and what its limits are. We could do something there we couldn't in our architecture.''</p>
        <p>For all the mystique of ''Tristan,'' a full-time theater designer would probably approach the piece as business as usual. For the newcomers Herzog &amp; de Meuron, as for Mr. Hockney and Mr. Viola before them, ''Tristan'' became an obsession -- and taught them a harsh lesson in creative efficiency.</p>
        <p>''It cost me a lot of money to do the operas I did, because I spent so long on them,'' Mr. Hockney said. ''They don't pay much. Theater is an ephemeral art. It's just performance, which is now, always now -- very different from painting. I'm not going to stop doing what I'm doing now. Nevertheless, I loved working in musical theater. But I wouldn't do it anymore.''</p>
        <p>Asked where he stood on these matters, Mr. Herzog laughed. ''I would never do another opera for money! You couldn't! We had an assistant working on 'Tristan' full time for more than a year. Not even counting my own time, I couldn't even calculate what this project cost us. It has to be something besides money that draws you. 'Tristan' was an important learning process. I wouldn't want to have missed it.''</p>
        <p>In case the Viola ''Tristan'' gives impresarios any bright ideas, they should know that the artist won't play. ''I'm not thinking about repeating this experience for quite a while,'' Mr. Viola said. '' 'Tristan' almost sank the ship! It took two years of my life. It stressed out my family beyond belief. The budget we had wasn't going to carry us through. We went into debt for it. But it was like a toboggan ride. You just hold on and keep going.''</p>

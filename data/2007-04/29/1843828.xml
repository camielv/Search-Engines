        <p>It was a bit of a shock when Toyota finally surpassed General Motors last week as the world's largest carmaker. Outside of disruptions caused by labor strikes, G.M. had led the pack for over 75 years. While hardly a cause for celebration in the American business community, Toyota's assumption of the crown -- after selling 2.35 million cars and trucks in its most recent quarter -- is not quite as bad as it appears.</p>
        <p>In a very important sense -- profitability -- G.M. had not been on top in some time. It fell behind in volume last quarter, by 109,000 vehicles, largely as a result of deciding to reduce its unprofitable bulk sales to rental-car companies and dialing back some of its costlier incentives. More important, analysts say that G.M. has awakened to the challenge posed by Toyota and, although more difficult results lie ahead, the company may finally be moving in the right direction.</p>

        <p>It was a bit of a shock when Toyota finally surpassed General Motors last week as the world's largest carmaker.

        <p>In a very important sense -- profitability -- G.M. had not been on top in some time. It fell behind in volume last quarter, by 109,000 vehicles, largely as a result of deciding to reduce its unprofitable bulk sales to rental-car companies and dialing back some of its costlier incentives. More important, analysts say that G.M. has awakened to the challenge posed by Toyota and, although more difficult results lie ahead, the company may finally be moving in the right direction.</p>
        <p>As global competition heats up, Americans will have to get used to having more of their companies fall from the top spot. How businesses respond will in no small way determine how well the United States succeeds in a world where it is no longer the unchallenged economic superpower.</p>
        <p>A major reason that so many American companies were world-beaters in the last century was the unmatched size of their rich and relatively homogenous domestic consumer market, big enough by itself for mass production, and bequeathing all the advantages of economies of scale for competition abroad. The United States economy is still the largest in the world, but ravenous young markets in places like India and China -- each with well over three times the population of America -- make clear that it will not stay that way forever. There will be ever more competitors from all over selling all over, and ready to knock off those in the old guard if they make the wrong choices.</p>
        <p>This is no reason for American business to despair; instead, it has to refocus on how to stay competitive in a world beyond American dominance. Germany's recent success might serve as a model. As Mark Landler wrote in The Times recently, Germany, with the world's third-largest economy, has been the world's largest exporter of goods the last four years. And, Americans who believe protectionism is needed to level the playing field should note, it has managed to do it without cheap labor. German businesses have prospered with a focus on quality and strong brands, and particularly with sophisticated niche products, from lasers to Porsches.</p>
        <p>Germany's recent success was not accomplished painlessly. There were wrenching layoffs and rounds of cost cutting and outsourcing along the way. General Motors faces a particular set of challenges because in the mass-market automobile game, the huge upfront costs of designing and building cars make sales volume crucial. But Germany's export prowess proves that for a smart industrialized country, many small successes can add up to No. 1.</p>

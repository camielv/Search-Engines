        <p>The suspect, Jack Rhodes, was charged with two counts of robbery as a hate crime, according to the Queens district attorney's office, because he singled out elderly victims. He was also charged in another robbery and a burglary.</p>

        <p>A 44-year-old man who investigators say assaulted two elderly women during muggings -- one of which was caught on video -- was charged in those cases and in two other crimes, the authorities said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Jack Rhodes, was charged with two counts of robbery as a hate crime, according to the Queens district attorney's office, because he singled out elderly victims. He was also charged in another robbery and a burglary.</p>
        <p>The attacks on the women, Rose Morat, 101, and Solange Elizee, 85, drew outrage, especially after a grainy surveillance video of the attack on Ms. Morat was broadcast on television. As Ms. Morat stood over her walker in the lobby of her Queens apartment building, an assailant punched her in the head.</p>
        <p>The robberies of the women occurred on March 4. House keys and $33 were taken from Ms. Morat, who lives in Jamaica, Queens; $32 and two rings, including a wedding band, were taken from Ms. Elizee, who lives about 10 blocks away, the police said. Both were briefly hospitalized.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 30, Mr. Rhodes attacked Angela Khan, 51, at her Jamaica home, the authorities said. He punched and kicked her and then stole cash, credit cards and her driver's license, they said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rhodes, who the district attorney said last lived in Long Island City, Queens, was arrested on Friday morning in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, the police said, adding that he was carrying a crack pipe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rhodes has previous convictions for robbery and burglary, according to state prison records. He was ordered held without bail after his arraignment yesterday.</p>

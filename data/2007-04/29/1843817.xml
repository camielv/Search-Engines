        <p>Tom Sawyer, metaphor of the digital age? Or cliché? Whichever, Mark Twain's 19th-century sprite is being name-checked a lot lately as a handy way to describe the Internet vogue du jour: exploiting free labor and content online. (Which brings to mind a reputed P. T. Barnum line. But never mind.) Excerpts follow.</p>
        <p>TOM KUNTZ  Tom Sawyer got it right. Why paint a fence when you can get your friends to do it for you for free? He would have been the perfect new-media mogul. Spending time and money creating content on the Internet is so hopelessly dated, so dotcom, so very, very 1.0. The secret of today's successful Web 2.0 companies: build a place that attracts people by encouraging them to create the content -- thereby drawing even more people in to create even more stuff. The poster child of this Sawyeresque business model is the photo-sharing site called Flickr.</p>

        <p>We're going to take the Tom Sawyer view and see how our users paint the fence.</p>
        <p>Marissa Mayer, Google vice president,</p>
        <p>USA Today, May 11</p>
        <p>These [online] games, like Phetch, employ a technique called ''human computation'' -- harnessing the human brain to collectively perform tasks that digital computers have yet to master It's the same trick the fictional Tom Sawyer famously used to get his friends to whitewash a fence for him, only multiplied millions of times.</p>
        <p>Ascribe Newswire, Sept. 19</p>
        <p>Most of these new-media companies apply the Tom Sawyer principle to the media business. You recall: Tom had to whitewash a fence, but persuaded other boys to whitewash it for him, by charging them for the privilege. The new-media model is to get ''users'' -- as audiences are called, as if they were addicts -- to create content, and then charge advertisers for the privilege of showing up.</p>
        <p>Economist.com, Dec. 1</p>
        <p>Like Tom Sawyer convincing pals that it's fun to paint a fence, the founders and Yelp Community Manager Nish Nadaraja used charm and trendy friends to make writing reviews for Yelp feel like a big party for San Francisco locals.</p>
        <p>Business Week Online, Dec. 7</p>
        <p>In Mark Twain's ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,'' we have a hero of our new media age, who is able to persuade his play pals not only to do the work for him but to pay him for the privilege of painting a fence. This is the next stage of competition. What can you get your users to do for you?</p>
        <p>India Today, April 9, 2007</p>
        <p>I'm guessing ole Tom's trickery is not a sustainable model for encouraging mass collaboration in a 21st century business venture. I think sustainable participatory models of business collaboration require financial incentives.</p>

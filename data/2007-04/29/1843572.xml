        <p>Smile at a stranger in Russia and he might think you're an idiot. Gesture ''O.K.'' to someone in France, and it might come across as an insult. Shake a woman's hand in India and risk a comeuppance. These are some of the lessons one can glean from the ''Culture Smart!'' book series, which explores local customs and etiquette and is now available in the United States. The compact editions, published in England since 2003, cost $9.95 in stores and cover dining, business rituals and etiquette, gift-giving and general local culture. There are 49 titles, including Argentina, Vietnam, China and Japan. In June, editions on Austria, Chile, Guatemala and Indonesia will hit the stores (www.culturesmartguides.com or www.randomhouse.com).  Moms celebrating Mother's Day in New York are the focus of a package offered by the Paramount Hotel (www.nycparamount.com) and Exhale Spa. The one-night package, which costs $513, includes a deluxe room for two, 30-minute fusion massage, facial, lavender paraffin manicure, Exhale products and a four-course meal in the Mezzanine Restaurant (only on Mother's Day, May 13, from noon to 10 p.m.). The experience is available by phone reservation only at (212) 764-5500. Hertz customers may now rent a 2008 Ford Shelby GT-H Mustang convertible (below) at some airports. The vehicle, part of the company's Fun Collection, has a starting rate of about $140 a day. Other cars in the collection include Mazda Miatas, Jeep Wranglers and H3 Hummers (www.hertz.com). From June 1 through September, Preferred Hotel Group will spearhead a charitable program called ''The Giving Room.'' Participating hotels and resorts, including the Majestic in Barcelona and the Derek in Houston, will donate 10 percent of the proceeds of a designated room or suite toward a specific charity. Some properties, like Peter Island Resort in the British Virgin Islands, are offering an entire villa. For more information, visit www.phggiftts.com.</p>

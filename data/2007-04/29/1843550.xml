        <p>A FAR COUNTRY</p>
        <p>By Daniel Mason.</p>
        <p>268 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.</p>
        <p>Westerners who write novels about the third world have a difficult job these days. For one thing, they have to compete with third-world novelists writing authoritatively about their own countries. It is far harder to affect the jaded knowingness of Graham Greene when you're worried that Zakes Mda will let everyone know you're talking nonsense. At the same time, Western writers must still navigate the same old obstacles: the third world is full of things that have no common Western names, and an author can easily spend so much time explaining unfamiliar phenomena that the novel degenerates into a ''Lonely Planet'' guide with fake people in it.</p>
        <p>Daniel Mason's first novel, a Conradian odyssey through colonial Burma called ''The Piano Tuner,'' fell into that trap. It had an English protagonist, a beautiful Burmese translator who reveals herself to be a secret revolutionary and a Kurtz-like mad genius gone native, building a remote utopia based on the soothing powers of Bach. The new book, happily, throws out most of this exotic baggage, notably the Westerners. Instead, it treats the locals of its drought-ravaged third-world country as if they were Westerners -- so successfully, in fact, that one wonders, early in the book, whether this nameless country is not some alternative-reality third-world Britain. ''A Far Country'' is a book about the world's poor, the several billion people who live as subsistence farmers or flee their land to scrabble for a living in the smog-choked megacities of the south. Its power lies in making the reader feel that, but for a bit of historical luck, its ''far country'' might be Britain, America or anywhere else.</p>
        <p>The book signals this intention from the start, in its handling of names: Catholic and vaguely Iberian, but rendered in English. The protagonist, Isabel, and her brother Isaias live in St. Michael in the Cane, a tiny hamlet near a dry river called Blackwater, where the farmers look forward to the festival of St. John. They grow sugarcane and manioc, but have been brought to the edge of starvation by repeated drought. The opening chapters establish the precariousness of this community, where a season without rain sends the men off to the coast or into the jungle in search of work in the ports or the gold mines. Historical memory goes back no more than two generations, the government and the law are alien forces, and rich men arrive bearing documents and guns, threatening to drive families off their miserable land.</p>
        <p>In this bleak environment, Isabel's family is her refuge. In particular, she shares a supernatural bond with Isaias, whom she can locate, even blindfolded, in the maze of the cane fields. This touch of MÃ¡rquezian magic realism risks making the novel feel derivative, particularly as it is by now clear we are somewhere in Latin America. But Mason plays down Isabel's gift, treating it less as a marvel than as a medical condition; it illustrates her adulation of her brother, a rakish fiddle player and the lodestar of her life.</p>
        <p>The book turns on Isaias' decision to flee St. Michael in the Cane for ''the city,'' where he hopes to find work as a musician. With Isaias gone, Isabel slowly withers, until at last her family sends her to look for him. She lands in the shanty of a cousin, who needs her to care for her baby so she can pursue work as a maid in the city's wealthy high-rises. Baby in tow, Isabel sets out day after day into the vast metropolis seeking her brother, lost now as he never was in the cane fields.</p>
        <p>The simple plot allows Mason to sketch a rough geography of the third-world city: the extra-legal hillside shantytowns of the poor immigrants, plagued by gangs and attacked by the police; the boulevards and high-rises that amaze new arrivals from the countryside, provoking condescension from those who arrived a few years earlier; the trash mountains, picked over by the poorest of the poor; and the gated communities of the wealthy, where the poor go to work as servants. One narrative climax comes in such an apartment complex, where Isabel confronts a rich woman she believes knows something about</p>
        <p>Isaias. The woman is perhaps only as rich as the average reader, but to Isabel she may as well be Ivana Trump, and her disdain infuriates the normally placid Isabel -- the first independent judgment she renders on her inequitable world.</p>
        <p>The arrival of the poor country bumpkin in the big city and the testing of filial affection against the cruelty of the industrializing economy have been myths of the modern age at least since Dickens. Mason's version has a more recent ancestor: ''Black Orpheus,'' the 1959 bossa nova film that set the Orpheus myth in the favelas above Rio de Janeiro. Many scenes recall the film strikingly, including one in the missing-persons bureau, where towers of dusty files drive home the hopelessness of Isabel's quest. The book errs in failing to update the surroundings; there are no dirty, obsolete PCs here, and one misses the bizarre multicultural fusions that cheap Internet cafes and pirated DVDs are creating in even the poorest societies. Perhaps Mason intends the setting to be the 1980s -- a veiled reference to AIDS makes anything earlier unlikely -- but that would rather blunt the book's immediacy.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the debt ''A Far Country'' owes to ''Black Orpheus'' only testifies to the enduring power of its narrative in third-world life. The fear that animates Isabel's quest is the terror not of poverty but of being lost: stripped away from one's village, one's family, from anything one might call home. Her search for her brother is a struggle to anchor herself against the modern world's chaos. In this case, however, it is Eurydice who is seeking her lost musician, not the other way around.</p>

        <p>Kirk Radomski, a former Mets clubhouse assistant who made a plea agreement Friday in which he admitted distributing performance-enhancing drugs to major baseball league players, was something of a curiosity here in his Long Island neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''Within the past three years, they put in a swimming pool,'' one neighbor, Janet Deblasi, said of Radomski and his wife, Christine.

        <p>Kirk Radomski, a former Mets clubhouse assistant who made a plea agreement Friday in which he admitted distributing performance-enhancing drugs to major baseball league players, was something of a curiosity here in his Long Island neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''Within the past three years, they put in a swimming pool,'' one neighbor, Janet Deblasi, said of Radomski and his wife, Christine. ''We could tell they had a lot of money, but it seemed like neither of them worked. They had one of the biggest houses and two Lexuses -- one was an S.U.V.''</p>
        <p>What activity the neighbors did see at the Radomskis' house came mostly in the form of deliveries.</p>
        <p>''I noticed that the FedEx truck was always there,'' Deblasi said. ''It would come quite a bit in the first few years. But two years ago, it stopped.''</p>
        <p>Deblasi said that she was under the impression that Radomski called himself ''some kind of athletic trainer,'' which struck her as probable enough.</p>
        <p>''He always wore exercise pants,'' she said. ''I never saw him wear jeans.'' She added that people in the neighborhood -- adults and children -- referred to him as the Hulk.</p>
        <p>Radomski apparently put in significant time on the weight bench in Long Island gyms. Employees at Ultimate Fitness, a gym in Riverhead, said that he signed a one-year membership contract in January and that he had been one of several refugees from a World Gym franchise in Hampton Bays that was being converted to a Planet Fitness branch.</p>
        <p>On the hierarchy of local gyms and gym chains, Planet Fitness holds more of a ''female-friendly'' position, said Steve Tria, a 23-year-old trainer at Ultimate Fitness, with a greater emphasis on cardiovascular machines and less on free weights. ''It's got a no-grunting policy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In any case, Radomski tended to show up on alternate evenings at Ultimate Fitness, putting in hard 45-minute workouts. But his visits stopped after March 20, the gym log shows. Tria and another young employee at the gym, Mike Carozza, said they had not been aware of Radomski's history with the Mets but were unfazed by his admission of distributing steroids.</p>
        <p>''Sitting behind this desk, you can tell people use steroids here,'' Tria said. ''It's not hard to miss.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''It's worse at other gyms.''</p>

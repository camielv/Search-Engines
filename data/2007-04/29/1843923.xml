        <p>Keyport, in Monmouth County, became the first New Jersey municipality to pass a law that bans smoking in cars while children are present. Under the law, approved by a 5-to-1 vote of the Borough Council last Tuesday, Keyport, population 8,000, can levy fines of $75 to drivers who smoke with passengers under the age of 17 inside their vehicles.</p>
        <p>Chatham, in Morris County, rejected a similar ban last month.</p>
        <p>''This is about protecting children against secondhand smoke,'' said Robert J. Bergen, Keyport's mayor.</p>
        <p>He said the law would be a secondary offense, meaning officers could not pull over a driver simply for smoking with children in the vehicle, but could issue a summons for the smoking offense if the driver was breaking another traffic law. The law is expected to take effect in the next month.</p>
        <p>In April 2005, the state passed a law making it illegal to smoke inside restaurants, bars and buildings; violators are subject to fines starting at $250. Casinos had been exempt from the law, but earlier this month an ordinance went into effect in Atlantic City that limits smoking to 25 percent of the casino gambling floor.</p>
        <p>''There is still work that needs to be done, but New Jersey is a leader in creating smoke-free environments, and this is another step to making children safer,'' said Karen Blumenfeld, a spokeswoman for New Jersey GASP, which stands for Group Against Smoking Pollution.</p>

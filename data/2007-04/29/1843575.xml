        <p>Did you know that 10 percent of the world's products are fakes and cheap imitations -- going way beyond the purses, jeans and watches you see on the street? Earlier this month, a museum devoted entirely to the subject of plagiarism opened in Solingen, Germany, near Cologne.</p>
        <p>Founded by a design professor, Rido Busse, who in 1977 began awarding companies who stole ideas from smaller companies the Plagiarius ''award'' (a black gnome with a gold nose to signify ''illicit earnings from product imitation''), the Plagiarius Museum (www.plagiarius.com), above right , seeks to highlight what it says is an annual loss of $275 billion to $415 billion caused by those who profit from others' work. Mr. Busse should know. A set of scales he developed for a German company was copied by a Chinese company.</p>

        <p>Unlike the Musée de Contrefaçon in Paris, which showcases copies of products from big companies, this museum focuses on fakes stolen from small designers. The most recent Plagiarius awards went to companies that copied such products as a Moleskine notebook, a love seat, salt and pepper shakers and even a urology set.</p>

        <p>On the heels of a major Supreme Court setback for women's reproductive rights, Gov. Eliot Spitzer has produced a sound proposal aimed at shoring up those rights in New York State. His timely initiative, which would update the state's abortion laws and inoculate them as much as possible from federal anti-abortion edicts, should be acted on quickly by lawmakers in Albany and emulated by other states.</p>
        <p>New York's pioneering law legalizing abortion, which Gov. Nelson Rockefeller signed in 1970, predated Roe v. Wade by three years. The provisions lifting the old abortion prohibition, and allowing abortion in many cases, are part of the state's homicide law, which is not the right place for them. Mr. Spitzer's updating would remove abortion from the criminal statutes and affirmatively make it a matter of professional and medical discretion. His proposal would also repeal an outmoded statute, previously overturned by the courts, that criminalizes providing nonprescription contraception to minors.</p>

        <p>On the heels of a major Supreme Court setback for women's reproductive rights, Gov. Eliot Spitzer has produced a sound proposal aimed at shoring up those rights in New York State. His timely initiative, which would update the state's abortion laws and inoculate them as much as possible from federal anti-abortion edicts, should be acted on quickly by lawmakers in Albany and emulated by other states.</p>
        <p>New York's pioneering law legalizing abortion, which Gov. Nelson Rockefeller signed in 1970, predated Roe v. Wade by three years. The provisions lifting the old abortion prohibition, and allowing abortion in many cases, are part of the state's homicide law, which is not the right place for them. Mr. Spitzer's updating would remove abortion from the criminal statutes and affirmatively make it a matter of professional and medical discretion. His proposal would also repeal an outmoded statute, previously overturned by the courts, that criminalizes providing nonprescription contraception to minors.</p>
        <p>Beyond that cleanup, the proposed legislation would enshrine in state law Roe's core protections, expressly protecting a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability, and making clear that her life and health take precedence over the rights of the fetus throughout pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Joseph Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, has indicated that he has no interest in moving forward with Mr. Spitzer's proposal. But with Republican control of the Senate now whittled down to just a few seats, blocking the abortion rights initiative carries real political risks. It would not be surprising if Mr. Bruno developed a sudden interest in the bill as legislative elections drew closer.</p>
        <p>New York, like other states, lacks the authority to undo the Congressional ban on so-called partial birth abortion just upheld by the Supreme Court. That is regrettable, since the ban endangers women because of its lack of any exception to protect a woman's health. The Spitzer bill cannot reverse the ruling. But it can put important protections in place in the event that the Supreme Court scales back federal abortion rights further, or even repeals Roe v. Wade entirely, handing the issue back to the states.</p>

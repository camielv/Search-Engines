        <p>The Galápagos Islands may soon be added to the World Heritage in Danger list. Last month, at the urging of the Ecuadorean government, a Unesco mission visited the national park and marine reserve there and confirmed that it is ''under threat,'' in part because of the ''uncontrolled development of tourism."</p>
        <p>''Tourism is the principal economic activity, which not only draws a large number of visitors to the site, but also promotes immigration for employment,'' said Kishore Rao, deputy director of the World Heritage Center in Paris. He said that that alien animal and plant species could severely affect the fragile ecosystem, which includes giant tortoises, marine iguanas and blue-footed boobies. As a result, he added, ''There is a need to plan and manage tourism in a much more sustainable and equitable manner."</p>

        <p>The Galápagos Islands may soon be added to the World Heritage in Danger list. Last month, at the urging of the Ecuadorean government, a Unesco mission visited the national park and marine reserve there and confirmed that it is ''under threat,'' in part because of the ''uncontrolled development of tourism."</p>
        <p>''Tourism is the principal economic activity, which not only draws a large number of visitors to the site, but also promotes immigration for employment,'' said Kishore Rao, deputy director of the World Heritage Center in Paris. He said that that alien animal and plant species could severely affect the fragile ecosystem, which includes giant tortoises, marine iguanas and blue-footed boobies. As a result, he added, ''There is a need to plan and manage tourism in a much more sustainable and equitable manner."</p>
        <p>''We share Unesco's concerns,'' said Johannah Barry, president of the Galápagos Conservancy, noting that the population on the islands has more than doubled in the last decade to 30,000. In the last 20 years, the number of tourists has risen to roughly 100,000 in 2006 from 20,000 visitors in 1985, according to Galápagos National Park figures.</p>
        <p>The islands, which were once visited by small groups, are now being visited by large vessels, said Ms. Barry, who explained that visitors are now backed up on the footpaths since only small groups are allowed on a trail at a time.</p>
        <p>Last winter, Judith Falloon-Reid, marketing director for Discovery World Cruises (www.discoveryworldcruises.com), said the line took 500 passengers to the Galápagos four times. She says it has scheduled two cruises there in early 2008.</p>
        <p>''Large ships impact the shoreline and don't maintain the integrity of the island,'' said Greg Findley, the founder of Detour (www.detourdestinations.com), which takes 300 travelers a year to the Galápagos, on ships carrying 16 to 32 passengers.</p>
        <p>''I am hoping the industry will sit down and decide on regulations,'' Ms. Barry said. ''The whole idea is to swim and walk with the animals, not line up with 50 other people to go on shore.''</p>

        <p>The Palestinian interior minister, Hani al-Qawasmi, submitted his resignation on Monday, five weeks after a unity government was sworn in, but was persuaded to stay on by the prime minister, Ismail Haniya of Hamas, Palestinian officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Qawasmi, a political independent, recently presented a security plan for restoring order in the Palestinian territories.

        <p>The Palestinian interior minister, Hani al-Qawasmi, submitted his resignation on Monday, five weeks after a unity government was sworn in, but was persuaded to stay on by the prime minister, Ismail Haniya of Hamas, Palestinian officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Qawasmi, a political independent, recently presented a security plan for restoring order in the Palestinian territories. His attempted resignation appeared to reflect his own doubts about his chances of success, as well as continuing rivalry over control of the security services.</p>
        <p>''He believes that some of the heads of the security services are not playing fairly with him, and that he was therefore heading for failure,'' said Radwan Abu Ayyash, a veteran Fatah official and deputy minister of culture, in a telephone interview from Ramallah in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>The Interior Ministry is a particularly delicate post because it is supposed to oversee most Palestinian Authority security services, which are largely made up of Fatah loyalists. Hamas has rejected demands to disband its own security organization, the Executive Force, or fold it into the other security services.</p>
        <p>Wrangling between the rival factions of Hamas and Fatah over the interior portfolio delayed for weeks the formation of a unity government, which was intended to halt internal violence and break the international boycott of the Hamas government.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of an agreement to create a unity government reached on Feb. 8, Hamas was allowed to nominate an independent for the position, but the candidate had to be approved by President Mahmoud Abbas, of Fatah. The sides compromised on Mr. Qawasmi, a former bureaucrat with little security expertise or political clout.</p>
        <p>But last month, Mr. Abbas named Muhammad Dahlan, a Fatah leader from Gaza and a former interior minister, as his national security adviser. Mr. Abbas charged Mr. Dahlan with restructuring the security services in a move that seemed to undercut Mr. Qawasmi's authority.</p>
        <p>While there has been a sharp reduction in factional violence since the agreement, clashes between feuding clans and gangs continue, particularly in Gaza. On Sunday, three Palestinians, including two brothers, were killed there.</p>
        <p>After a weekend of Israeli-Palestinian violence that left nine Palestinians dead, the atmosphere remained tense.</p>
        <p>Militants fired one Qassam rocket from Gaza into Israel on Monday morning as Israelis observed the annual Remembrance Day for fallen soldiers. No injuries were reported.</p>

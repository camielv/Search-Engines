        <p>The site of the Navy brig, a former naval prison next to the Brooklyn Navy Yard in Fort Greene, will be turned into a mixed-income housing complex with town houses, co-op apartments, rental apartments, supportive housing, a day care center and perhaps even an environmentally friendly dry cleaner, city officials said yesterday. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development announced that a partnership between the Dunn Development Corporation and L&amp;M Equity Participants Ltd., two development companies specializing in low-priced housing, would redevelop the 103,000-square-foot site between Flushing and Park Avenues with 434 housing units.</p>

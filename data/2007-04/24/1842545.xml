        <p>The governing party's candidate for president, Umaru Yar'Adua, easily won the election in Nigeria, election officials here announced Monday. But his chief rivals for the office immediately rejected the results, and international observers said that the voting, which took place amid chaos, fraud and violence, was not credible.</p>
        <p>The announcement sets the stage for a volatile period as Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, largest oil producer and second largest economy, tries to hand power for the first time from one elected civilian government to another and seal its transition to democracy.</p>
        <p>The violence, ballot stuffing and disarray that surrounded the voting have already marred that transition, and unrest after the announcement of Mr. Yar'Adua's victory could scuttle it altogether. The departing president, Olusegun Obasanjo, is set to step down after two terms on May 29. Before he took office in 1999, Nigeria endured decades of autocratic military rule.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, called the contest ''a flawed election, and in some instances, deeply flawed.'' Similarly, the election observer mission of the European Union blasted the conduct of the election and questioned the legitimacy of the results, which handed huge victories to Mr. Obasanjo's party, the People's Democratic Party. Mr. Yar'Adua was credited with 24,638,063 votes. His nearest rival, Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator, had less than one-fourth as many votes.</p>
        <p>Max van den Berg, chief observer for the European Union mission, said at a news conference that the elections ''have fallen far short of basic international and regional standard for elections.''</p>
        <p>The process, he concluded, ''cannot be considered to have been credible.''</p>
        <p>Observers from the National Democratic Institute, a pro-democracy organization that monitors elections worldwide, concluded that, ''the 2007 polls represent a step backward in the conduct of elections in Nigeria.''</p>
        <p>Speaking at a news conference here, Mr. Yar'Adua dismissed allegations of rigging and called for unity, saying that he had been elected by a broad coalition of voters. ''The contest has come and gone,'' he said. ''So must our differences dissipate in the cause of the greater good of moving our dear nation ahead.''</p>
        <p>But opposition parties and election observers said the process was far from over. Defeated candidates were preparing legal challenges in many races, arguing that the lack of organization by the nation's Independent National Electoral Commission, vote rigging by party officials and the violence and intimidation that kept many voters from the polls were enough to annul the results in many races, including the presidential contest.</p>
        <p>''This is just the beginning of the process,'' said Femi Falana, a prominent Nigerian lawyer and president of the West African Bar Association, who is expected to handle several of the election cases. ''We will fight this to the very top.''</p>
        <p>The law requires that special election tribunals quickly hear challenges to election results. The courts have recently shown a willingness to challenge the country's powerful president, defying his attempts to prevent his onetime ally and now bitter rival, Vice President Atiku Abubakar, from running for president.</p>
        <p>Election officials barred Mr. Abubakar from running because he was indicted on corruption charges by an administrative panel, but the Supreme Court ruled days before the election that he had been unlawfully removed.</p>
        <p>Last-minute ballots were printed and distributed to include him, but the ballots showed only party symbols, not the names of candidates, and lacked serial numbers that help reduce fraud. These irregularities are likely to figure prominently in legal challenges to the election.</p>
        <p>The National Assembly was set to meet Tuesday in an emergency session to discuss the election, though it has little power to act in election disputes, which are the responsibility of the judiciary. The Senate president, Ken Nnamani, is a member of the ruling party, but he has been highly critical of the conduct of the election.</p>
        <p>Nigeria is entering a dangerous period that could bring serious instability, said Peter Lewis, head of the African Studies program at Johns Hopkins University, who observed the election in the southeastern state of Abia.</p>
        <p>''The fundamentals are not O.K.; the system is in crisis,'' Mr. Lewis said in an interview. ''There is potential for real instability.''</p>
        <p>The pitfalls are numerous, but a common fear is that widespread unrest by citizens angry that they were not able to vote will prompt the military to step in and seize power to re-establish order. Nigeria has been ruled by its powerful military for much of its post-colonial history, with only brief interludes of civilian rule in the 47 years since it won independence from Britain.</p>
        <p>As election observers issued their preliminary reports on Monday on the presidential and state voting, a grim picture emerged of mass rigging, incompetence by election officials, delay and intimidation.</p>
        <p>European Union observers said they witnessed instances of ballot-box theft, long delays in the delivery of ballots and other materials, and a shortage of ballots for the presidential race. In half of the polling stations their teams visited, there was no privacy for voters to mark their ballots in secret. Observers also witnessed unused ballots being marked and stuffed into ballot boxes.</p>
        <p>In a televised speech to the nation on Monday, Mr. Obasanjo admitted there were serious problems.</p>
        <p>''Our elections could not have been said to have been perfect,'' he said. ''My advice to all those who feel aggrieved by the outcome of the elections is that they should avail themselves of the laid-down constitutional procedure for seeking redress in electoral matters.''</p>
        <p>He chastised the political parties for their behavior during the election and pleaded for calm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yar'Adua, a 56-year-old governor of the remote northern state of Katsina, had been a reclusive figure from a prominent political family. Under the unwritten rules of Nigerian politics, which dictate that the presidency alternate between the north and south, a northern Muslim like Mr. Yar'Adua would undoubtedly replace Mr. Obasanjo, a Yoruba Christian from the southwest.</p>
        <p>Seldom seen outside his home state and rumored to have kidney disease, Mr. Yar'Adua was a surprise choice for the ruling party as a presidential candidate, leading to speculation that he was chosen as a weak stand-in for Mr. Obasanjo, who is limited to two terms as president by the Constitution.</p>
        <p>But supporters of Mr. Yar'Adua say he is his own man, who plans to continue the reforms of Mr. Obasanjo's government, but put his own stamp on the nation.</p>

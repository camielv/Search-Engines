        <p>South Korea, facing criticism after it agreed Sunday to send 400,000 tons of rice to North Korea despite the North's prevarication on a Feb 13 international agreement to shut down its main nuclear reactor, warned that North Korea might not get all the aid if it continued to refuse to live up to its commitment. ''We emphasized that the speed and timing of the aid shipments could be changed depending on the North's sincere implementation of the Feb. 13 agreement,'' Lee Jae-Joung, the unification minister, said in a statement. The agreement signed Sunday contained no such preconditions. South Korea is to send the first shipment of rice in late May. Critics from the political opposition and conservative civic groups in Seoul had urged the government not to promise any aid until after the North had made a move to shut down the nuclear reactor.</p>

        <p>British Airways said it was in discussions with several private equity investors about entering a joint bid for Iberia Líneas Aéreas de España, increasing the chances of a bidding war for the Spanish carrier. The Texas Pacific Group, the American buyout firm, made a $4.6 billion approach for Iberia last month. One person with knowledge of the negotiations, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said British Airways, which already owns a 10 percent stake in Iberia, was considering either joining the Texas Pacific bid or backing a bid from one of two other private equity firms, which were not named. British Airways, which has ruled out a bid on its own, said in a statement that any bidding group in which it was involved would probably ''include one or more Spanish partners.''</p>

        <p>It was Zalmay Khalilzad's first day on the job as the American permanent representative to the United Nations. Mr. Khalilzad, the former ambassador to Iraq who replaced John R. Bolton after he resigned the United Nations post in December when he failed to obtain Senate confirmation, will travel immediately, joining a Security Council mission departing New York today for Serbia and Kosovo. The United States supports a United Nations plan for granting near-independence to Kosovo, but Russia, a veto-bearing member of the Council, is seeking to renegotiate it and called for the trip so ambassadors could see conditions on the ground. Mr. Khalilzad will become head of the Council for May, when the United States occupies the rotating presidency of the 15-member body. Richard A. Grenell, the spokesman for the American mission, quoted Mr. Khalilzad as saying his priorities would be Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Sudan and United Nations reform.</p>

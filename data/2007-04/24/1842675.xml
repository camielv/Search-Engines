        <p>The Agriculture Department has again lowered the number of people whose Social Security numbers were disclosed in a public database posted on the Census Bureau's Web site. The department, which was alerted to the problem two weeks ago, now says about 37,800 numbers were exposed. Initially, it had said 100,000 to 150,000 people were affected, before lowering the number to 63,000. It says the current number reflects a complete review of all records posted in the database. The department will provide credit monitoring for one year for the people whose Social Security numbers were exposed.</p>

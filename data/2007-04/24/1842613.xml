        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I disagree with Kirk W. Johnson's characterization, in ''Hounded by Insurgents, Abandoned by Us'' (Op-Ed, April 18), of my objection to a recent legislative proposal that would revise the immigration code's prohibition on allowing individuals tied to terrorist activity or groups to enter the United States.</p>
        <p>I support the original purpose of the legislation, which is to permit groups like the Hmong in Southeast Asia and Iraqis who have helped the United States in their country and do not pose a threat to our security to enter the United States.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I disagree with Kirk W. Johnson's characterization, in ''Hounded by Insurgents, Abandoned by Us'' (Op-Ed, April 18), of my objection to a recent legislative proposal that would revise the immigration code's prohibition on allowing individuals tied to terrorist activity or groups to enter the United States.</p>
        <p>I support the original purpose of the legislation, which is to permit groups like the Hmong in Southeast Asia and Iraqis who have helped the United States in their country and do not pose a threat to our security to enter the United States.</p>
        <p>I oppose the way the legislation was eventually written because it would make it very difficult to bar people from entering the United States who have given material support to even the worst terrorist groups, such as Hamas and Al Qaeda. That is simply unacceptable.</p>
        <p>We all agree that we should help the Hmong and other groups that have taken personal risks to assist the United States. That's why I introduced amendments to the 9/11 commission bill that would allow entry to groups like the Hmong, but would bar people tied to groups that indisputably are terrorist organizations.</p>

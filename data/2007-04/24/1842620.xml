        <p>From a boardroom set at a rainy Hollywood Bowl, Donald Trump hired Stefani Schaeffer, a 32-year-old lawyer, as the sixth season of NBC's ''Apprentice'' came to a close on Sunday, drawing marginally improved ratings. Mr. Trump chose Ms. Schaeffer despite his concerns that she advanced largely ''under the radar'' during the 14 weeks of competition. According to Nielsen's estimates, the live finale attracted 7.9 million viewers, leading the 10 p.m. hour among adults 18 to 49 and delivering the show's largest audience in nearly three months. Average ratings for ''The Apprentice'' have fallen precipitously every season since its debut in January 2004. Compared with the 21 million viewers averaged that first season, this year's edition, the only one set in Los Angeles, drew just 7 million on average. NBC has yet to announce whether the reality show will be renewed. For the night, the network finished third in total viewers and fourth in the 18-to-49 demographic, just behind CBS. ABC led the night over all.</p>

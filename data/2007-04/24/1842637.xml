        <p>A devastating suicide car bombing on Monday killed nine American soldiers near a patrol base in Diyala Province, the military announced early Tuesday morning.</p>
        <p>It was one of the most lethal suicide bomb attacks on American troops in Iraq. Another occurred on Dec. 21, 2004, when a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest walked into a mess tent on an American base in Mosul and detonated his charge, killing 14 United States soldiers.</p>
        <p>In the past six months, Diyala Province, where several Sunni Arab insurgent groups are active, has become one of the most dangerous places in Iraq for American soldiers.</p>
        <p>Twenty soldiers and one Iraqi civilian were also wounded in the blast on Monday, the military said. Eight of the soldiers and the Iraqi civilian were evacuated to an allied medical center; the others returned to duty.</p>
        <p>Later, three of the soldiers who were evacuated also returned to duty, according to a statement issued by the military. There was no other information available about the attack.</p>
        <p>Other attacks in which large numbers of American military personnel have died include several instances in which insurgents shot down helicopters carrying numerous troops and one attack on United States marines serving in Anbar Province.</p>
        <p>In that attack, on Aug. 3, 2005, a huge roadside bomb exploded near Haditha, killing 14 marines who were involved in combat operations and traveling in an amphibious vehicle.</p>
        <p>On Monday, an American soldier also died in Muqdadiya when a roadside bomb exploded, the military said in a news release.</p>
        <p>Across Iraq, five car bombs exploded Monday, killing a total of 22 people, and a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest walked into a popular restaurant near Baghdad's fortified International Zone, formerly known as the Green Zone, and detonated his explosives, killing six people.</p>
        <p>Ten people were killed in northern Iraq when a suicide car bomber struck a Kurdish Democratic Party outpost on Monday.</p>
        <p>In Baquba, in Diyala Province, a suicide car bomber attacked a group of police cars parked at an intersection, killing six policemen and a seventh, who was injured, later died, according to a government official in Baquba.</p>
        <p>In Hilla, a suicide car bomber attacked a restaurant, killing two people.</p>
        <p>In Falluja, two suicide truck bombs exploded near the Huriyah neighborhood, killing three people, according to a statement from the United States military.</p>

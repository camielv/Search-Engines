        <p>Prison Sentences in Munch Thefts  Sentences from five and a half to nine and a half years were imposed yesterday by an appeals court in Oslo on the gunman, the mastermind and the getaway driver in the theft of the Edvard Munch masterpieces ''The Scream,'' above left, and ''Madonna,'' right, The Associated Press reported. Petter Tharaldsen, 35, the getaway driver, was given nine years and six months for grand theft in the Munch case and an unrelated robbery. Bjoern Hoen, 39, the mastermind, was sentenced to nine years for grand theft, and Stian Skjold, 31, one of the gunmen, to five and a half years. They were also ordered to pay a total of $263,000 in compensation to the city of Oslo, owner of the paintings, which were stolen in a daring daylight robbery at the Munch Museum in 2004. The paintings were recovered in August, but both were damaged.</p>
        <p>New Gershwin Prize Given to Paul Simon  Paul Simon has been chosen to be the first recipient of the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. Named for George and Ira Gershwin, the new award is to be given annually to a composer or performer whose lifetime contributions exemplify the excellence associated with the Gershwins. ''Few songwriters have had a broader influence or contributed to more song genres than Paul Simon,'' said James H. Billington, librarian of Congress. ''Because of the depth, range and sheer beauty of his music, as well as its ability to bridge peoples and cultures, he is the perfect first recipient of this prestigious award.'' Mr. Simon, above, is to the receive the honor in ceremonies on May 23 at the Warner Theater in Washington, where the performers will include Marc Anthony, Art Garfunkel, Philip Glass, Alison Krauss, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Lyle Lovett, James Taylor and Buckwheat Zydeco. PBS will televise the event nationally on June 27.</p>
        <p>Festival Prize for Work By Slain Filmmaker  ''The Waitress,'' a romantic comedy written and directed by Adrienne Shelly, who was murdered in Greenwich Village on Nov. 1, won the narrative feature competition on Saturday at the ninth annual Sarasota Film Festival in Florida, Reuters reported. The award carries a $5,000 prize.</p>
        <p>Sienna Miller Takes On Dylan Thomas Film  Exit Lindsay Lohan and enter Sienna Miller in a film about the life of Dylan Thomas that is scheduled to go before the cameras next month in Wales, Variety.com reported. Ms. Lohan had been expected to play the role of Thomas's wife, Caitlin MacNamara, in ''The Best Time of Our Lives,'' but when she and the backers could not agree on a deal, she dropped out and Ms. Miller, above, stepped in. Keira Knightley will play Thomas's childhood friend Vera Phillips in the story of the rivalry between the two women over the Welsh poet, to be played by Matthew Rhys. The script was written by the playwright Sharman Macdonald, Ms. Knightley's mother, and is to be directed by John Maybury.</p>

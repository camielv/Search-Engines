        <p>I could not agree more with Frank Rich (''Iraq Is the Ultimate Aphrodisiac,'' column, April 22) about the president's rushing to Blacksburg, Va., to be the nation's mourner in chief.</p>
        <p>The president said ''our nation is shocked and saddened'' by the violence at Virginia Tech and that he and Laura Bush had come to Blacksburg ''with hearts full of sorrow.''

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I could not agree more with Frank Rich (''Iraq Is the Ultimate Aphrodisiac,'' column, April 22) about the president's rushing to Blacksburg, Va., to be the nation's mourner in chief.</p>
        <p>The president said ''our nation is shocked and saddened'' by the violence at Virginia Tech and that he and Laura Bush had come to Blacksburg ''with hearts full of sorrow.'' Yet what happened at Blacksburg is a daily occurrence in Iraq precipitated by an ill-considered invasion and a bungled occupation.</p>
        <p>Where is the president's sense of shock and sadness when it comes to Iraq? Where is his sense of grief and sorrow for the Iraqis who die every day?</p>
        <p>We have yet to see President Bush rush to Baghdad to be with family members who mourn the deaths of loved ones -- not to mention the scores of individuals who died just this last week alone.</p>
        <p>The juxtaposition of Blacksburg and Baghdad is heartbreaking, to say the least.</p>

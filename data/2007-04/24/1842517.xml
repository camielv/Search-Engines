        <p>Watching one of Barbara Mahler's dances is like witnessing two personalities tangled in a longstanding feud. The surface is all cool restraint, a lid that seems to suppress a multitude of seething emotions. But an eruption, in Ms. Mahler's crisply arranged choreography, is a rare thing. Her rigid style is a tough shell to crack.</p>
        <p>In ''There's No Place Like Home,'' her latest evening of work, performed at Danspace Project on Friday, Ms. Mahler explores, as the show's subtitle states, ''Dances based on the travels and stories of my grandfather.'' Even so, Ms. Mahler's austere investigations have less to do with creating a narrative world than with the juxtaposition of stillness and the energetic impulses that propel movement into action.</p>

        <p>Watching one of Barbara Mahler's dances is like witnessing two personalities tangled in a longstanding feud. The surface is all cool restraint, a lid that seems to suppress a multitude of seething emotions. But an eruption, in Ms. Mahler's crisply arranged choreography, is a rare thing. Her rigid style is a tough shell to crack.</p>
        <p>In ''There's No Place Like Home,'' her latest evening of work, performed at Danspace Project on Friday, Ms. Mahler explores, as the show's subtitle states, ''Dances based on the travels and stories of my grandfather.'' Even so, Ms. Mahler's austere investigations have less to do with creating a narrative world than with the juxtaposition of stillness and the energetic impulses that propel movement into action.</p>
        <p>Revered as an influential teacher in experimental circles, Ms. Mahler began with ''Prologue,'' set to music by the Argentine songwriter Atahualpa Yupanqui. In the solo, a strange combination of pretty and plain, Rebecca Pearl sat on the floor, using the momentum of a whipping leg or a rapid crawl on her forearms to send her body darting in different directions. She luxuriated in the details: her florid hands and expansive legs and arms located the solace of the sensual music.</p>
        <p>''Forward Motions,'' as performed by Donna Costello, continued Ms. Mahler's study of movement that pitches the body forward in tight lines. A video projection by Ms. Mahler followed, in which close-ups of bare feet, coins and an umbrella in the rain were altogether tedious.</p>
        <p>The trio ''In Her body/Urbanscapes,'' for Ms. Mahler, Ms. Pearl and Jessica Winograd, explored familiar terrain: the individual within a group. Dancers glided in and out of sculptured positions, frequently freezing in space to demonstrate isolation. In ''Raw Tenderness,'' set to Bob Dylan's ''Ain't Talkin','' Ms. Mahler revisited material from the trio and her video projections.</p>
        <p>Dropping coins on the stage, she offered a portrait of a vulnerable woman overwhelmed by tentativeness. But all too often the mechanics behind the movement were more compelling than the outcome. As with loose change, the sum didn't add up to much.</p>

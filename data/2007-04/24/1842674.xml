        <p>Gov. Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, is expected to sign a measure that would make Washington the second state, after California, to grant paid leave to workers after the birth of a child. The bill, passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature on Sunday, would provide up to $250 a week to new parents starting in October 2009. Parents of adopted children could also receive benefits. The bill was amended to remove a section that would have extended the benefits to people caring for a seriously ill relative. The program is expected to cost $19.7 million in 2010 and $21.4 million in 2011, legislative staff members said. The bill did not designate a financing source but instead created a task force to make recommendations by January 2008. California's paid family leave program, which started in 2004, provides up to $882 per week for a total of six weeks and offers benefits for those caring for an ill relative.</p>

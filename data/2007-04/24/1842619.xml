        <p>Carl Bernstein, right, the journalist who, with Bob Woodward, uncovered the Watergate scandal for The Washington Post more than three decades ago, has finished a biography of Hillary Rodham Clinton, below, to be published by Alfred A. Knopf in June. ''A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' which will weigh in at 640 pages, covers her life up through her decision to run for president, according to a press release issued yesterday. Paul Bogaards, a Knopf spokesman, said that Mr. Bernstein ''reaches conclusions that stand in opposition to what Hillary Clinton has said and written about herself.'' Mr. Bernstein's book is one of at least two biographies about Mrs. Clinton scheduled to come out this summer. ''Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., reporters for The New York Times, is to be published by Little, Brown &amp; Company on Aug. 28, according to Michael Pietsch, Little, Brown's publisher. Mr. Pietsch said the company was ''presently reviewing our publication schedule.'' Mr. Bernstein has been working on his book, which was done without Mrs. Clinton's official cooperation, for eight years. Knopf decided to advance publication, tentatively planned for this fall, as soon as it received the final chapter last Thursday, Mr. Bogaards said. The book has been simultaneously translated so that it can be published in Germany and the Netherlands at the same time as in the United States. Knopf is planning an initial print run of 350,000 copies in the United States.</p>

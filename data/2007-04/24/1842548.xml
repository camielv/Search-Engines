        <p>''HI. Hopefully you saw me in Star magazine with the actor Bill Murray as well as Miss Big Blue in the Page Six magazine of The New York Post.  and the list goes on, thanks for listening. You have gotten the line of Miss Liberty U.S.A. I guess I'm like Miss Everything. Please leave a message. I would love to hear from you.''</p>
        <p>The voice on the answering machine belongs to Sondra Fortunato, who has won the most coveted titles you never heard of: Miss World Series, Miss Pontiac, Miss Portable Ignition, Miss Hurricane Relief, Miss Tuscan Milk and Miss Body Beautiful U.S.A.</p>

        <p>''HI. Hopefully you saw me in Star magazine with the actor Bill Murray as well as Miss Big Blue in the Page Six magazine of The New York Post.  and the list goes on, thanks for listening. You have gotten the line of Miss Liberty U.S.A. I guess I'm like Miss Everything. Please leave a message. I would love to hear from you.''</p>
        <p>The voice on the answering machine belongs to Sondra Fortunato, who has won the most coveted titles you never heard of: Miss World Series, Miss Pontiac, Miss Portable Ignition, Miss Hurricane Relief, Miss Tuscan Milk and Miss Body Beautiful U.S.A.</p>
        <p>''In my prime, I boasted some Hall of Fame numbers: 38-22-35,'' she said with a chuckle.</p>
        <p>For the past 30 years, Ms. Fortunato has used her physique along with a skillful art for self-promotion to achieve a level of tabloid fame a few notches below Paris Hilton's. It is only a coincidence that her niece Paula Fortunato is married to Sumner M. Redstone, the chief executive of Viacom.</p>
        <p>This weekend, Ms. Fortunato will pull from her closet a sash that reads Miss N.F.L. Draft Day, put on a matching crown and gown, and go about the business of meeting and greeting at the 2007 National Football League draft at Radio City Music Hall.</p>
        <p>''I'm a huge N.F.L. fan,'' she said. ''In fact, Dave Jennings always told me I should have kept a diary.''</p>
        <p>If she had listened to Mr. Jennings, a former punter for both the Giants and Jets, the first page of that diary might recall the night in the late 1970s when a blond teenager who had traveled from her home in Toms River, N.J., to Shea Stadium to root for the Jets was spotted by the ''Monday Night Football'' cameras.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fortunato was soon being recruited by sports teams and sponsors as a centerpiece for promotional campaigns.</p>
        <p>Since then, she has carefully blended the roles of beauty queen, pitchwoman and mascot. She has been a queen or celebrity guest at dozens of parades, including the Mummers Parade in Philadelphia in January.</p>
        <p>She has also been a guest on television shows and has made cameos in movies like ''Easy Money,'' ''Caddyshack'' and ''Pumping Iron.''</p>
        <p>''She has this unbelievable ability to get her picture in newspapers and magazines and on television,'' said Wesley Walker, a former Jets receiver. ''I don't know how she does it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fortunato, who gave her age as late 40s and said she was married but separated, has thought about ''hanging up the cleats.''</p>
        <p>''But just when I'm about to step out of the spotlight, I get more appearances,'' she said. ''Photographers still jockey for position to take my picture.''</p>

        <p>STRINGER--Ronald E. of New York City and Coconut Creek, FL, died on April 20, 2007. He is survived by his wife Sandra, sons David and Scott Stringer, stepdaughters Cynthia Zucker, Amy Gold and seven grandchildren. Counsel to New York City's Mayor, Abe Beam during the 1970's fiscal crisis, Professor of Constitutional Law at John Jay College and The Police Academy of San Juan Puerto Rico. A graduate of Bronx Science High School, City College and Brooklyn Law School, he was a fervent defender of the law. He changed the quality of people's lives through the giving effort of his pro-bono representation, as well as by serving as night court arbitrator for many years. Cherished by his students, he instilled the importance and power of a good education. He and Sandy shared their passion for travel, the environment and wildlife preservation. We will all miss his compassion, positive outlook, sense of humor and the sparkle in his eye. Memorial Contributions may be made to John Jay College Library, 899 10th Avenue, NY, NY 10019.</p>

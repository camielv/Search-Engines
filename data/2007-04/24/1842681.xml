        <p>One man was killed and another wounded yesterday when they were shot in a sport utility vehicle in Bedford-Stuyvesant by gunmen who pulled up alongside them and began firing, the police said. The driver, Isaiah E. Jacob, 21, of Brooklyn, was shot once in the torso and killed, and his passenger, who was not identified, was in stable condition late yesterday at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center with two gunshot wounds, the police said. They said two gunmen in a sedan pulled up beside the S.U.V. around 12:20 p.m. at Marcy and Lafayette Avenues. There were no arrests yesterday.</p>

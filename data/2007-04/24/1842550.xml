        <p>Lawmakers began weighing ways Monday to prevent more tragedies on college campuses in a hastily convened Senate hearing a week after the shootings in Virginia. The hearing explored the adequacy of campuses' mental health resources, security plans and communications systems.</p>
        <p>''We are here to begin a discussion, in the aftermath of Virginia Tech, to make sure that we are doing everything we can to prevent any other campus and any other students and their families from experiencing the nightmare and loss Virginia Tech experienced,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut independent who is chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.</p>

        <p>Lawmakers began weighing ways Monday to prevent more tragedies on college campuses in a hastily convened Senate hearing a week after the shootings in Virginia. The hearing explored the adequacy of campuses' mental health resources, security plans and communications systems.</p>
        <p>''We are here to begin a discussion, in the aftermath of Virginia Tech, to make sure that we are doing everything we can to prevent any other campus and any other students and their families from experiencing the nightmare and loss Virginia Tech experienced,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut independent who is chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.</p>
        <p>Some of the most disturbing testimony came from Russ Federman, director of counseling and psychological services at the University of Virginia.</p>
        <p>Dr. Federman ticked off statistics from a recent survey about the extent of mental health problems on campuses. He said that 94 percent of students reported feeling overwhelmed by all they have to do, and that nearly 50 percent reported having felt so depressed that it was difficult to function.</p>
        <p>In the same survey, 9 percent of students reported seriously considering suicide and 1.3 percent actually attempted suicide. Colleges' counseling centers are struggling to keep up, Dr. Federman said.</p>
        <p>He cited a study from 1996 that found there was one full-time clinical staff member for every 1,598 students. In 2006, however, the ratio had fallen to one per 1,697 students.</p>
        <p>''We are not getting ahead of the curve,'' he said. ''If anything, we are beginning to slide behind.''</p>
        <p>David Ward, president of the American Council on Education, which represents more than 1,800 college presidents, said many campuses were already taking steps to improve security. Mr. Ward cited the University of Memphis, which is installing a schoolwide intercom system. The University of Iowa is considering a similar system.</p>
        <p>But W. Roger Webb, president of the University of Central Oklahoma and a former Oklahoma commissioner of public safety, said that while Sept. 11 attacks should have been ''a wake-up call'' to the possibilities of mass violence, ''in reality, not much has happened on most college campuses in this country in terms of increasing our level of security.''</p>
        <p>Much of the testimony focused on the difficulty of securing campuses that are essentially small towns and the challenges of balancing the rights of individuals to privacy with the need for community safety.</p>
        <p>Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the committee's ranking Republican, questioned witnesses about whether they believed that some of the laws that govern privacy of medical and school records needed to be changed.</p>
        <p>None had a ready answer, but they agreed that the most difficult situations involved students who were clearly troubled yet refused treatment. They also agreed that university officials often hesitated to act because they feared litigation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Collins mused about whether some sort of limited liability protection needed to be provided to university officials in such cases.</p>
        <p>''It just strikes me as a terrible dilemma,'' she said. ''Oftentimes in these cases, there are warning signs. There are people who identify the student as being very troubled and in need of help.''</p>

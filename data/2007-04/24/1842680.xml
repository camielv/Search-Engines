        <p>The Claremont Riding Academy on the Upper West Side will shut down at 5 p.m. on Sunday, the owner, Paul Novograd, said yesterday. The academy, which opened as a livery stable in 1892, has been a riding academy since the 1920s, Mr. Novograd said. He said the increased popularity of the park's bridle path among pedestrians had made it very difficult for riders. The closing of the academy, which is on West 89th Street, was first reported in The New York Post. Homes will be found for the approximately 45 horses that are stabled there, Mr. Novograd said.</p>

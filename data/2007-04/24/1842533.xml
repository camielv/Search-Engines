        <p>The very idea of denying the Holocaust is so ludicrous that any attempt at writing a serious play on the subject would seem futile. Yet Peter Sagal's ''Denial,'' at the Metropolitan Playhouse, is an engrossing legal drama that examines the moral and ethical dilemmas inherent in the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>Bernard Cooper is a mild-mannered engineering professor who has written a book and published a newsletter saying that the Holocaust was a fiction perpetrated by Henry Morgenthau Jr. and other Jews to malign der Führer and draw international sympathy.</p>
        <p>A sort of milquetoast neo-Nazi himself, Cooper is a cult hero to skinheads whose idea of fun is to beat up Jews. When the F.B.I. raids his house, seizes his mailing lists and charges him with inciting violence, Cooper appeals to the American Civil Liberties Union, which in turn sends him to Abigail Gersten.</p>
        <p>Gersten, a Jewish lawyer whose belief in the First Amendment overcomes her personal revulsion for Cooper, takes the case. ''A witch hunt is a witch hunt, even if he happens to be a witch,'' she reasons. The prosecutor is a zealous young Jew fresh out of law school who wears a skullcap and tries to shame Gersten into refusing to represent Cooper.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the conflict is the question of how much sufferance a free society should give its crackpots to maintain its liberties. And at what point does the threat of violence to citizens validate curtailing an individual's rights?</p>
        <p>Mr. Sagal uses this platform to examine the issue of Holocaust denial. In fairness, he lets Cooper present his argument and even introduces a plot twist that exposes a false account of a death at Auschwitz that had appeared in a book by a famous survivor of the camp. Cooper posits that one lie makes the whole account of Holocaust horrors suspect.</p>
        <p>For the most part, Mr. Sagal avoids sermonizing, although a final scene tacked on as a sort of redemptive coda for Gersten is ill advised. He also employs some dubious legal practices to bring the Holocaust denier and survivor face to face in the lawyer's office. But the characters are well drawn, the arguments balanced, and the central issues couldn't be more timely.</p>
        <p>Under Alex Roe's smooth direction, the six actors give able performances. As Gersten, Suzanne Toren is thoroughly convincing as a woman struggling to reconcile conflicting beliefs. As Cooper, H. Clark Kee is chillingly calculating. And John Tobias delivers an excellent turn at the end as Nathan, the Auschwitz victim who actually survived.</p>
        <p>''Denial'' continues through May 13 at the Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 995-5302.</p>

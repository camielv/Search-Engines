        <p>A television review last Tuesday of the documentary ''Gangs of Iraq'' on PBS omitted a word in a quotation from a motivational speaker shown addressing Iraqi police trainees. He said, '''I am not here to impose my American will upon you'' -- not ''I am here.'' A listing of credits with the review carried outdated information from PBS about the program's producer and erroneously credited another executive. The producer is Marcela Gaviria -- not Martin Smith, who was correctly identified in the article as the PBS correspondent. Sherry Jones is a senior producer -- not an executive producer, the position held by David Fanning.</p>

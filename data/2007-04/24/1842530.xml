        <p>The romance of the last-minute substitute has given Erika Sunnegardh a mini-fame of sorts in the opera world. In a much-publicized charge to the rescue a year ago, Ms. Sunnegardh, a Swedish soprano, replaced Karita Mattila in a Metropolitan Opera Saturday broadcast of ''Fidelio.'' She also did something of the kind a few weeks ago at ''Turandot,'' stepping into the title role for Andrea Gruber, who was ill. Saturday night was to be Ms. Sunnegardh's first bona fide appearance in the Met's revival of that Puccini potboiler, so it seemed wise to check on the progress of this rags-to-relative-prosperity career.</p>
        <p>In some ways ''Turandot'' at the Met is a three-way battle of titans: a giant soprano part competing with a giant musical score, not to mention the giant production of Franco Zeffirelli, the vastness and extravagance of which brooks no interference from mere opera singers. Our most famous Turandots have put triumphant loudness at the top of their list of virtues. Many are the Wagnerian sopranos who have rejoiced in the opportunity to let loose without having to do it for five hours.</p>

        <p>In some ways ''Turandot'' at the Met is a three-way battle of titans: a giant soprano part competing with a giant musical score, not to mention the giant production of Franco Zeffirelli, the vastness and extravagance of which brooks no interference from mere opera singers. Our most famous Turandots have put triumphant loudness at the top of their list of virtues. Many are the Wagnerian sopranos who have rejoiced in the opportunity to let loose without having to do it for five hours.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sunnegardh brings several advantages to the battlefield. She is the rare Turandot who both sings like an object of hopeless desire and looks like one -- presentable, agile and reasonably regal in her movements. Her voice is big enough without being explosive, and sounds its best when projecting flat-out and emerging from great masses of ensemble sound. There is still some hard steel at the top of her range (where the part spends much of its time), but Ms. Sunnegardh was steady and often forceful. She should be pleased with herself.</p>
        <p>You forget how much fun this production is. If any opera lends itself to Mr. Zeffirelli's spendthrift interior decoration, it is this one. The chorus and orchestra and the dancers seemed to be having as much fun as I was. Everything worked. This is the Met at its best.</p>
        <p>''Turandot'' will be repeated tomorrow, Saturday and May 3 and 8 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000.</p>

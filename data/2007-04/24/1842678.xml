        <p>The vacancy rate for rental apartments in nearly every Manhattan neighborhood remained below 1 percent for all of 2006, according to data released yesterday by the rental brokerage firm Citi Habitats Inc. Last year was the first time in the five years that Citi Habitats has been collecting this data that the vacancy rate was below 1 percent throughout the whole year. In the West Village, the vacancy rate shrank as low as 0.49 percent. Prices for studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments throughout Manhattan jumped by about 9 percent from the previous year, and prices for three-bedroom apartments rose by nearly 14 percent. Citi Habitats surveyed 60,000 units for its report.</p>

        <p>CORNELL--Richard D. Loving husband, father and friend, dedicated to his dental profession, Dr. Richard Cornell passed away Friday evening the 20th of April in peaceful surroundings in Palm Beach County, Florida. Born in Brooklyn October 8th, 1924, he attended the College of William &amp; Mary, Chapel Hill, and New York University College of Dentistry in an accelerated Armed Forces program. He served honorably in both the United States Army and Navy and upon return from Germany settled in the NY Rivertown village of Dobbs Ferry where he established his dental practice. An avid golfer, photographer, and lover of life, always dedicated to his patients, family, and friends, he now rests in peace. He is predeceased by his eldest son, Jonathan Cornell. Dick Cornell is survived by his wife of 56 years, Betty Cornell, his brother Robert Cornell, sister-in-law Mari Cornell, his two sons Ivan and David, his daughter-in-law Valerie Gutterman, and two grandchildren Elizabeth and Julianne Cornell. Rest in peace now father. We know in our hearts your infectious smile will always be looking over us. Shalom. Funeral services will be held Tuesday April 24th, 2007, 9:30 am at Temple Beth Abraham, 25 Leroy Avenue, Tarrytown, NY with interment at Montefiore Cemetery, 121 - 83 Springfield Blvd., Springfield Gardens, Queens, NY.</p>

        <p>HIRSCH--Rev. A. Asher. With profound sorrow the worldwide Shaare Zedek family mourns the loss of this righteous individual and true ''eved Hashem''. A man of great emunah and Torah wisdom who inspired us all, he over came personal heartbreak and loss to devote his life to alleviating the spiritual burdens and physical ailments of countless thousands, both in New York and in Jerusalem. For the past fifty years, he served the Hospital with unparalleled devotion, un matched distinction and unwavering commitment to Halacha, first as the American Committee's founding Executive Director, and then, following his aliyah to Eretz Yis rael in 1979 with his dear wife Henrietta, as Director of the Hospital's Religious Services Unit. We will always cherish his leadership and be eternal ly grateful for his five decades of tireless efforts that continue to play such a vital role in the growth and development of the American Committee and the Medical Center itself. Heartfelt condolences to his beloved Henrietta, brother Benjamin, children Miriam and Noftoli, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem Erica Jesselson, Chair Emeritus Sidney G. Adler, Treasurer Emeritus Michael G. Jesselson, Chair Menno Ratzker, Vice Chair Jack C. Bendheim, President Prof. Jonathan Halevy, Director-General Lee Weinbach, President, National Women's Division Michael S. Strauss, Board of Governors Paul S. Glasser, Nat'l Director Morrie Libman, Regional Director</p>

        <p>AIRLINE EMPLOYMENT -- The number of employees working for domestic airlines in February rose 0.2 percent over February 2006, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. But the increase was not because of hiring by the major carriers. Despite record passenger demand, the network carriers had 2.2 percent fewer workers than the previous February. Instead, regional carriers are adding employees (up 5.9 percent over February 2006) as are low-cost carriers (up 5 percent). Compared with February 2003, the number of employees at the big network carriers declined 23.3 percent, to 262,400, from 342,300. Meanwhile, employment at low-cost carriers rose 8.3 percent, to 71,400, from 65,900, and employment at regional carriers rose 22.4 percent, to 599,000, from 489,000 in 2004. That was the first year regional carriers reported unified employee statistics.</p>
        <p>INDIAN AIRLINE EXPANDING -- Jet Airways, the largest domestic carrier in India, says it will start service to the United States in late August with daily flights to Kennedy International Airport from Delhi, via Brussels. The airline, in the middle of a multibillion-dollar expansion, will use Boeing 777-300ER aircraft on the flights, which include first-class cabins with amenities like private doors. With $3.7 billion invested in new aircraft, Jet Airways describes its expansion as ''the most aggressive and comprehensive the airline industry has ever witnessed.''</p>
        <p>REGISTERED TRAVELER SURVEY -- A recent survey commissioned by the Deloitte &amp; Touche USA consulting firm found that the ''vast majority'' of travelers said they were not interested in signing up for the Registered Traveler program. But 70 percent of frequent travelers, defined as those who travel once a month or more, would consider enrolling if their employers paid the $99.95 annual fee for Clear, the only version of the program operating. Meanwhile, Verified Identity Pass, which operates the Clear expedited-security program at five airports with others scheduled to open shortly, said that the Little Rock Municipal Airport in Arkansas had selected Clear, and enrollment is expected to begin ''within 30 days.'' Other companies plan to operate competing versions of the program starting later this year.</p>
        <p>GRAND TOUR -- Eclipse Aviation, maker of the first very-light jets on the market, sent one of its new Eclipse 500 jets outside North America for the first time. The jet, which has a range of 1,100 miles, flew to Friedrichshafen, Germany, last week for the AERO 2007 show, with stops in Canada, Greenland, Iceland and Britain. The plane will then fly to Cannes, France, and Geneva before returning home. Eclipse said it had 100 orders in Europe for the $1.5 million jet. The order backlog for the aircraft is 2,500.</p>
        <p>ET CETERA -- The once-renowned Fontainebleau Hotel on Miami Beach, which opened in 1954, is undergoing a $500 million renovation, with the reopening scheduled for July 2008. The hotel will have 1,500 rooms, and its opening will underscore a revival in the mid-Miami Beach section, overshadowed in the last 20 years by the South Beach area.  Continental Airlines says it now has seamless e-ticketing for all of its worldwide SkyTeam alliance partners as well as other code-share partners. The process allows passengers to fly on multiple affiliated carriers using a single paperless e-ticket.  Hertz now offers hourly car rentals at three locations in Manhattan with rates starting at $12.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Volvo division of the Ford Motor Company has named a team of two agencies to handle its worldwide creative account. The agencies, Arnold Worldwide and Nitro, will share an assignment with spending estimated at $150 million to $200 million.</p>
        <p>Arnold, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas, will take the lead on the global assignment, developing strategy and creative ideas from its Boston office. Nitro, from its London office, will focus on campaigns for most of Europe.</p>
        <p>A review for the Volvo account, which began in December, also included Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, another Havas unit that had been the principal Volvo global creative agency since 1991.</p>
        <p>Euro RSCG was eliminated from the review in late March, along with 180 in Amsterdam, majority owned by the Omnicom Group. The final round of the review pitted the team of Arnold and Nitro against Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of the Publicis Groupe.</p>
        <p>Arnold is returning to the automotive category after almost two years. The agency lost its Volkswagen of America creative account in 2005 to Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky in Miami, part of MDC Partners. Volvo is the first automotive client for Nitro, a fast-growing independent agency that works for marketers like Mars and Unilever.</p>
        <p>The campaigns that Arnold and Nitro will create will appear in big Volvo markets like North America and much of Europe. Other regions of the world can adapt the ads for their local needs.</p>
        <p>The first ads from Arnold and Nitro will help Volvo introduce two major models, the V70 station wagon and the XC70 crossover.</p>
        <p>They are due in the summer and fall.</p>
        <p>Euro RSCG will continue creating ads for Volvo in the Asian-Pacific market, but that assignment is expected to be placed in review in several months. Nitro, which was founded in Shanghai in 2002, has experience in the Asian-Pacific region.</p>

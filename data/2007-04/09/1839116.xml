        <p>In 1887 a Polish scholar named Ludwig Zamenhof introduced an international language he called Esperanto.

        <p>Zamenhof's language failed in part because it imposed intellectual rules on an organism with a mind of its own. Twelve-tone music might be said to have failed for the same reason.

        <p>In 1887 a Polish scholar named Ludwig Zamenhof introduced an international language he called Esperanto. It thrived and then languished in the hearts of political idealists, internationalists and dreamers after one-world unity. For a few hours at Town Hall on Saturday night the Absolute Ensemble and some visitors from Lebanon had another try at universality. The program had the title ''Absolute Arabian Nights.''</p>
        <p>Zamenhof's language failed in part because it imposed intellectual rules on an organism with a mind of its own. Twelve-tone music might be said to have failed for the same reason. Languages, musical or otherwise, react to human pressures. They either collide or intermix or both, depending on what is happening in the world. The political collisions of West and Middle East, not to mention uneasy foreign relations between classical and popular musical styles, were really the subject of the evening.</p>
        <p>Kristjan Jarvi's Absolute Ensemble was a handful of traditional strings and winds held up by Damien Bassman's jazz-rock drum set. Marcel Khalife -- playing his lutelike oud, singing and speaking off-the-cuff in Arabic -- was reverently greeted by an audience largely familiar with both his language and music. Electric current went through virtually every instrument, heavy amplification creating a wall of bright, forward, often high-decibel sound.</p>
        <p>Listeners were happily bounced between a musical United Nations and the Tower of Babel. It was like being part of a tour package: one day in the Caribbean, the next in New Orleans, then an avant-garde moment at the Darmstadt Festival and a night in Beirut. Communal energy bridged the contradictions; the strong rhythmic playing of Mr. Khalife, the metric twists and turns in the seven Daniel Schnyder compositions here and Mr. Bassman's splendid flurries all had something in common.</p>
        <p>When two musical cultures meet, however, old rules of arithmetic do not apply. Middle Eastern music thrives on melody and its adornment, and uses scales of fewer notes. European-style music is about melody's freedom to move anywhere and to combine with other melodies. Putting the two together usually means subtraction rather than addition. One side is hamstrung by the other's limitation. The other side is not designed to handle all the freedom.</p>
        <p>The result is a kind of mushy middle ground, where both cultures are compromised. Mr. Khalife's singing, charming and refined as it was, sounded like 1960s Euro-pop: Michel Legrand with Arabic ornamentation. The Absolute's contributions -- despite Mr. Schnyder's inventiveness and the band's splendid playing in difficult music -- related to Lebanon as chinoiserie does to China. The result was a third language of moderate sophistication and occasional clich√©s, with only a passing acquaintance with its two ingredients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schnyder played the saxophone, and Bassam Saba was excellent on a variety of instruments, as was Matt Herkowitz at his various keyboards. Mr. Jarvi presided with easy assurance over an excellent group of players.</p>

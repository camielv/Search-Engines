        <p>Tiger Woods, needing an eagle 3 to climb into contention in the Masters, had crushed a driver off the tee of the dogleg-left, 510-yard 13th hole, and now he knew that his iron shot would land far behind the flagstick perched near the front of the green. And whether his listeners were in the gallery or watching on television, he was heard to yell:</p>
        <p>''God, bite!''</p>
        <p>God must have been listening yesterday. Instead of his ball staying on the ridge that runs through the green, it slowly slid down and down and down the slope until it stopped about 5 feet from the cup. When his putt disappeared for the eagle 3 that he had needed, Woods had moved to three over par for the tournament, two strokes behind Zach Johnson with five holes remaining.</p>
        <p>But after that, God apparently turned off his earpiece. Woods did not make so much as another birdie, and Johnson, shooting a three-under-par 69, won by two strokes over Woods and two South Africans, Retief Goosen and Rory Sabbatini.</p>
        <p>Water, wind and missed birdie putts on the 14th and 16th holes ended Woods's opportunity to win his fifth Masters and third consecutive major title after having dominated last year's British Open at Royal Liverpool and the P.G.A. Championship at Medinah outside Chicago.</p>
        <p>On the 530-yard 15th hole, his iron out of the rough bounced backward off the slope into the pond in front of the green, but he saved par with a 10-foot putt. On the 440-yard 17th, his approach plopped into the bunker in front of the green.</p>
        <p>''What the hell just happened?'' he barked, turning toward his caddie, Steve Williams. ''Dead downwind.''</p>
        <p>To tie Johnson at one over, Woods had needed to birdie the last two holes. But after blasting out of the bunker, he made a par-saving 10-foot putt. Needing an eagle 2 on the 465-yard final hole to force a playoff with Johnson, his approach stopped about 25 feet from the hole. But over the four rounds, he had made only one birdie on the last two holes (during Friday's third round) while scratching out four bogeys.</p>
        <p>''I threw this tournament away on two days when I had two good rounds and I went bogey-bogey at the end,'' he said later, referring to his 5-5 finish both Thursday and Saturday. ''Four bogeys in the last two holes basically cost me the tournament.''</p>
        <p>Woods's game was simply not as razor sharp as usual, not nearly as sharp as it was in his four Masters triumphs and nowhere as sharp as it was at Royal Liverpool at last year's British Open, when he controlled the flight of his ball as well as he ever had, often using a fairway wood or a long iron off the tee.</p>
        <p>He had not been sharp going into the Masters, beginning with a third-round knockout by Australia's Nick O'Hern in the Accenture Match Play Championship, when he missed a winning 4-foot putt on the first extra hole and lost on the next hole, and continuing with a tie for 22nd at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, where he closed with a 76.</p>
        <p>Even though Woods won the CA Championship two weeks ago, he was so insecure with a three-stroke lead that he hit an iron off the tee on Doral's treacherous 18th hole and played safely for a winning bogey.</p>
        <p>At the Masters, he never broke par. He opened with a one-over 73, then shot 74-72-72 for 291, three over par. He never appeared to be comfortable with his swing or with his putter. After he pushed a tee shot into the trees on the 11th hole yesterday, his follow-through with a 4-iron slammed into a pine, bending the shaft. He snapped it in two.</p>
        <p>Woods had talked how the secret to scoring here was to avoid double bogeys or three-putt greens. He never had a double bogey, but he had 15 bogeys, including six on Friday.</p>
        <p>On a warmer and less windy day yesterday, after Saturday's frosty gusts had dropped the wind chill to a record low of 42 for the Masters, scores were lower. Johnson, Goosen and Sabbatini each shot 69.</p>
        <p>''The pin locations were a little bit softer,'' Woods said. ''They were probably two or three steps from where they usually are, so they gave us a break, which was nice. Gave us a chance to go out there and score.''</p>
        <p>For Woods, they were rare scores: none in the 60s. In winning his 12 majors, he shot all four rounds in the 60s in two, three rounds in the 60s in five and two rounds in the 60s in five.</p>
        <p>But with 12 victories in his first 41 majors as a pro, Woods remains well ahead of Jack Nicklaus's pace in winning a record 18 majors. Nicklaus won his 12th in his 48th major, the 1974 P.G.A. Championship. But without another green jacket, Woods lost any chance for a grand slam this year.</p>
        <p>And his two bogey-bogey finishes that cost him this Masters were a reminder that the game doesn't let you win all the time. Even if you're Tiger Woods.</p>

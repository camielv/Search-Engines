        <p>Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Sunday became the latest Republican to criticize Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales for the dismissals of eight United States attorneys, and he said Mr. Gonzales should consider stepping down.</p>
        <p>''This is the most mishandled, artificial, self-created mess that I can remember in the years, in the years I've been active in public life,'' Mr. Gingrich said on ''Fox News Sunday.''</p>

        <p>Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Sunday became the latest Republican to criticize Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales for the dismissals of eight United States attorneys, and he said Mr. Gonzales should consider stepping down.</p>
        <p>''This is the most mishandled, artificial, self-created mess that I can remember in the years, in the years I've been active in public life,'' Mr. Gingrich said on ''Fox News Sunday.''</p>
        <p>''You know, the buck has to stop somewhere, and I'm assuming it's the attorney general and his immediate team,'' he said. Asked whether Mr. Gonzales should resign, Mr. Gingrich replied, ''I cannot imagine how he is going to be effective for the rest of this administration.''</p>
        <p>''I think the country, in fact, would be much better served to have a new team at the Justice Department, across the board,'' added Mr. Gingrich, who is reported to be considering a run for the presidency.</p>
        <p>D. Kyle Sampson, the attorney general's former chief of staff and one of three aides to resign amid the controversy, told the Senate Judiciary Committee recently that Mr. Gonzales had been deeply involved in discussions about the dismissals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sampson appeared to contradict Mr. Gonzales, who has said he had little involvement. An April 17 appearance by Mr. Gonzales before the judiciary panel is widely viewed as a make-or-break event for him.</p>
        <p>Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, a Republican on the committee, said on the ABC program ''This Week'' on Sunday that the dismissals had been handled in a ''ham-handed way,'' and that Mr. Gonzales had to restore confidence in his leadership.</p>
        <p>But Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat on the committee who appeared with Mr. Gingrich on ''Fox News Sunday,'' said it was too late. ''Fundamentally, he's not up to the job,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''And he should step down.''</p>

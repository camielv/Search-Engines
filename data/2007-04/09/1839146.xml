        <p>The sun was missing. Wintry winds scythed over the city and snow flurries hovered in the air. But on the coldest Easter since 1940 -- colder even than last Christmas -- bells pealed, hymns resounded in the churches and a subtle spring beauty cut the gloom on Fifth Avenue and in quiet corners of New York.</p>
        <p>On Fifth Avenue, where visitors with cameras seemed to outnumber the poseurs in sweeping bonnets and top hats in the annual Easter parade immortalized by Judy Garland and Fred Astaire, little boys threw back their heads and caught the dancing snowflakes on wagging tongues.</p>
        <p>Overlooking the skating rink at Rockefeller Center, Tom Snelling, a visitor from Australia, watched with a half-frozen smile as his rosy-cheeked wife, Maureen, raised a tiny digital camera with shivering hands. ''This is definitely the coldest Easter we've ever experienced,'' he said. ''But we love New York. This is our first time to America, so it's all worth it.''</p>
        <p>On a gray day that evoked El Greco's darkened Toledo, an awning of clouds hung over the city. The temperature rose timidly to 40 degrees in the afternoon before falling back into the 30s, a pattern that has been roughly repeated for five days and will linger for a few more, forecasters said.</p>
        <p>Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, called it the coldest Easter since March 24, 1940, when it was 31 degrees, and colder than last Christmas, which topped out at 45 degrees. Because the holiday sometimes falls in March, snow here on Easter is not so uncommon. The biggest accumulation was 4 inches in 1970; yesterday's was only a trace.</p>
        <p>But it provided an unusual touch to the day, a backdrop in chiaroscuro that made the flowers at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden all the more vivid: ranks of tulips in their red-and-flame-tipped uniforms, the white buds of flowering dogwoods, reddish thumbs in the notches of Japanese maples and sprouts of pink and white petals aboard the magnolias.</p>
        <p>Under clouds that parted now and then for magical sunbeams, visitors could walk around the 52 acres of gardens -- home to 10,000 varieties of plants -- and see lemony sprays of forsythia, a grassy hill cloaked in yellow daffodils, a stand of lavender Korean azaleas with flat round petals the size of silver dollars.</p>
        <p>In the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden, a home to ducks, turtles and herons, the golden koi, an Asian carp, darted about in the water like sequined creatures. The mood was serene, meditative, peaceful: people strolled in twos and threes, chatting quietly, as if they had just stepped out of a Meiji-era print.</p>
        <p>''It's such a lovely Easter,'' said Audrey Hailes, 18, who was there with Ismail Cruz, 20, and Darius Homayoun, 19, all students at New York University. ''It's a cool little touch of God, with the snow and the sunshine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cruz said they had walked through an orchard when flurries were falling heavily, evoking memories from childhood. ''It looked like a pillow fight,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nearby, Veronica Hasfal, 39, of Baldwin, N.Y., was watching her daughter, Clarissa Eustache, 10, trying without success to jump up and snare the pink petals of a Japanese flowering cherry tree. Clarissa was wearing a white Easter dress under a puffy pink parka. She looked like a little pink flower herself.</p>
        <p>In Prospect Park, four wedding parties were going on along the lakeside, the brides in white, the men in tuxedos.</p>
        <p>Fred and Fabiola Meeks of Queens went to brunch at the boathouse with two daughters in Easter finery: Priscilla, 10, in an aqua blue dress, a matching headband and baby blue espadrilles studded with pearls; Krystal, 3, in a hot-pink flower-pattern dress, fuchsia slippers and a pink wool coat and cap. Priscilla tap-danced on the walk; Krystal beamed and spread her arms wide for a photograph.</p>
        <p>Somehow, Maia Amellio, 7, had lost her yellow ducky at the park's Audubon Center, where she and her family had gone to see the exhibits. She was crestfallen, but described it for the receptionist.</p>
        <p>''It has two legs, two wings, it's furry and has a big beak,'' she said. It was found by her aunt, Christina Rubin, who tucked it in her jacket, with its head peeking out.</p>
        <p>''My ducky! My ducky!'' Maia squealed, pulling it out.</p>
        <p>''What do I get for that?'' Aunt Christina asked.</p>
        <p>She got a big Easter hug.</p>
        <p>On Fifth Avenue, another collection of bizarre bonnets made their appearance, along with toques and boaters and beribboned chapeaux. When the snow fell, some parade-watchers took refuge in the echoing arches and golden Vermeer light of St. Patrick's Cathedral. But one woman stood on the cathedral steps in the wind, steadying with one hand the fantasia of butterflies atop her laundry-basket hat.</p>
        <p>Fuat Palanduz, who emigrated from Turkey with his family five years ago, was surveying the illustrious avenue, the tourists and revelers, the hawkers of knock-off watches and the diversity of America. ''It's unbelievable,'' he said. ''We've had a wonderful day!''</p>

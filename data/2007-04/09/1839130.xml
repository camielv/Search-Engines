        <p>It has all the makings of a standard Italian financial melodrama, with the usual cast of characters.</p>
        <p>There is a struggling company that is a takeover target, and the controlling shareholder trying to squeeze what he can from a bad investment. Add to that a just-resigned chairman, a group of minority shareholders excluded from the deal, and foreign buyers facing a reluctant government and skeptical financial establishment.</p>
        <p>The struggling company is Telecom Italia, which has attracted several potential buyers over the last six months. The only concrete offer, however, came on April 1 when AT&amp;T and América Móvil, the Latin American cellphone company, each offered to buy a third of Olimpia, which owns 18 percent of Telecom Italia's common shares, for a combined investment of about 4.5 billion euros($6 billion).</p>
        <p>Marco Tronchetti Provera, chairman of the tire company Pirelli, controls Telecom Italia through Pirelli's 80 percent stake in Olimpia, a holding he has been trying to sell for several months. His investment in Telecom Italia has lost half its value in the six years.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Tronchetti Provera ousted Guido Rossi, considered by many in financial circles here to be one of the country's top turnaround specialists for troubled companies, as a result of differences on strategy.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T and América Móvil, which now have the largest cellphone businesses in the United States and Latin America, respectively, may have dropped into this Italian soap opera unprepared for the reaction from some politicians and business leaders, who are demanding that Telecom Italia remain in domestic hands.</p>
        <p>''The intertwining of business and politics is not a great omen for success,'' Jan Dawson, an analyst with the telecommunications consulting firm Ovum, and two colleagues wrote in a note to clients last week. ''Ownership and control of Telecom Italia is a political football in Italy.''</p>
        <p>Critics of the Italian version of capitalism noted that AT&amp;T and América Móvil were in a position to control Telecom Italia, which has a market value of 44 billion euros, by investing little more than two billion euros each for their one-third stakes in Olimpia.</p>
        <p>Pirelli and its partner, the Benetton family, would hold on to the remaining third of Olimpia, though they would probably have an opportunity to sell that to AT&amp;T and América Móvil within a year. Olimpia wields effective control over Telecom Italia through its right to appoint 80 percent of the phone company's board members.</p>
        <p>With its investment, AT&amp;T would get a strong foothold in Italy's corporate market and an expanded presence in Germany, France and the Netherlands -- countries where Telecom Italia has been building broadband businesses. AT&amp;T already sells telecommunications services to big European companies and provides services in Europe for companies based in the United States.</p>
        <p>''This would complement AT&amp;T's global business,'' said Niall Hickey, a company spokesman in London. ''And on the other hand, we think we can work with Telecom Italia to develop products and services together for the Italian market.''</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T's biggest cost, which it either absorbs or passes on to customers through higher prices, is what it pays telecommunications companies to use their networks. Owning a stake in Telecom Italia would give AT&amp;T privileged access to the company's backbone network that crisscrosses Italy and connects to nine European countries. Though AT&amp;T has infrastructure in 30 European countries, in most cases it is modest.</p>
        <p>América Móvil's interest in Telecom Italia is almost certainly linked to the Italian company's Brazilian unit, TIM Brasil, the second-largest cellphone provider there with 25 million subscribers.</p>
        <p>América Móvil, which did not respond to requests for comment on the Telecom Italia deal, tried unsuccessfully last year to buy TIM Brasil. AT&amp;T owns about 9 percent of América Móvil, which is controlled by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helú.</p>
        <p>''América Móvil wants the first chance to buy TIM Brasil if it is sold,'' said Carlo Gentili, a founder of Nextam Partners, a hedge fund and asset management company based in London and Milan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tronchetti Provera, who was chairman of Telecom Italia until September, had said he is willing to consider offers for TIM Brasil, but the potential sale was shelved when Mr. Rossi succeeded him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rossi and others criticized the move because TIM Brasil is the only part of Telecom Italia's business that is growing and continues to have room to expand. The company's domestic fixed-line and cellular businesses, which face a saturated market and fierce competition, did not grow last year.</p>
        <p>Telecom Italia, like most of Europe's former phone monopolies, is struggling to repay large amounts of debt accumulated in recent years, and selling TIM Brasil would give it funds to pay back part of its 37 billion euros in debt.</p>
        <p>''Tronchetti has been a disaster for Telecom Italia, '' Mr. Gentili said, ''and the company has suffered economically and strategically while he has been in control.</p>
        <p>''Investors have lost money on his shift, but somebody is making money out of this because this is the fifth time Pirelli seems to be on the verge of selling, and every time nothing happens. They say they might sell, the shares rise for a while, somebody makes money and then the shares drop when the sale falls through. You can be sure you aren't losing money if you are directing the operating.''</p>
        <p>Minority shareholders, about 20 percent of them non-Italian, would watch if Mr. Tronchetti Provera sold his stake in Telecom Italia. No deal has been signed, but the companies are in exclusive talks with Pirelli until the end of the month.</p>
        <p>When Pirelli paid an 80 percent premium over Telecom Italia's share price to buy control of the company in 2001, that deal also occurred outside the market and excluded minority shareholders.</p>
        <p>As in any such drama, there is a chance that a hero will appear and propose an all-Italian solution to replace Mr. Tronchetti Provera and keep Telecom Italia from foreign buyers.</p>
        <p>But for now, AT&amp;T and América Móvil seem to be the only game in town.</p>

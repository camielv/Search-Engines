        <p>Like the many branches of the ''CSI'' empire, ''CSI: NY'' is popular television police drama. Its Canadian co-producer, Alliance Atlantis Communications, is now arguing that the program is also about history.</p>
        <p>Alliance Atlantis, based in Toronto, is in a dispute with Canada's broadcast regulator over the true nature of ''CSI: NY,'' which is being broadcast two or three times a day on History Television, a cable channel also owned by Alliance Atlantis.</p>
        <p>Maureen Parker, executive director of the Writers Guild of Canada, said she enjoys ''CSI: NY'' and is a fan of the History Television channel. But she does not think that the two go together.</p>
        <p>'' 'CSI' is on every other channel all the time,'' Ms. Parker said. ''It's conventional TV fare. History is not the place for it. To me, it is just a blatant abuse of their terms of license.''</p>
        <p>Unlike regulators in the United States, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission determines what kinds of programs individual cable channels are allowed to broadcast.</p>
        <p>After Ms. Parker contacted the commission, it asked Alliance Atlantis to explain History's programming decision. The broadcaster replied that ''CSI: NY'' is a history series because it is ''set in a city that became synonymous with one of history's most significant and notorious events, 9/11.''</p>
        <p>To Ms. Parker, that response has only made things worse. She said she was offended that the company would ''misuse a tragedy like 9/11 for commercial purposes.''</p>
        <p>Nor was the regulator impressed. In a letter to Alliance Atlantis on March 29, it wrote that ''the mere fact that the drama is set in a city which was victim to a significant historical event is not sufficient justification for broadcasting the program on a service that is mandated to be devoted to history programs.''</p>
        <p>The letter effectively orders the company to withdraw the program.</p>
        <p>Alliance Atlantis declined to make anyone available for an interview. In a brief e-mail message, a spokeswoman, Nicola McIsaac, wrote, ''We do think 'CSI: NY' fits on the channel, and we are in the process of determining next steps.''</p>

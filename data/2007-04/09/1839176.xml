        <p>When police officers searching for a newborn baby arrived early Saturday at the home of a Brooklyn woman who was thought to be the mother, one of her sisters told them, ''What you're looking for is in the back.''</p>
        <p>There in a garbage bag, wrapped in a towel, the police found a baby who was later declared dead.</p>
        <p>The sister, Andria Sergio, 27, was released on her own recognizance yesterday after being arraigned in a Brooklyn court on charges of incorrectly disposing of a human body. Her comment to police officers was quoted in the criminal complaint. Ms. Sergio's sister Laura Sergio, 25, is charged with murder.</p>
        <p>She was taken to Lutheran Medical Center on Friday night, suffering from abdominal pains and bleeding. Hospital workers determined that she had recently given birth.</p>
        <p>Then officers went to the home on Colonial Road in Bay Ridge where the sisters live with their parents, Dominick and Lena, and a third sister, Cara Sergio, 29. On the back porch, officers found an unresponsive infant girl, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police said that Laura Sergio killed the girl shortly after giving birth on Friday night. The medical examiner's office said the baby died of hypothermia and asphyxiation.</p>
        <p>Disbelief at the charges spread yesterday.</p>
        <p>Elisa R. Muresan, a former professor at Long Island University, taught Laura Sergio three finance courses several years ago and said she had been struck by her student's academic prowess and generosity of spirit. Laura Sergio made the university's Dean's List in 2004, online records show.</p>
        <p>''A standout? Yes, definitely,'' said Ms. Muresan, who is now an associate at Standard &amp; Poor's. Laura Sergio had planned to go to graduate school or law school, and Ms. Muresan said: ''I was so proud of her. I cannot believe this has happened.''</p>
        <p>Laura Sergio was in stable condition, a hospital spokesman said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Cara Sergio was charged on Saturday with obstructing governmental administration, but law enforcement officials said yesterday that they expected those charges to be dropped.</p>

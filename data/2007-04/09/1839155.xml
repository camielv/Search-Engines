        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I would like to heartily second Steve Hallock's plea for legal action to ensure that Amtrak begins to have priority use of railroad tracks over freight trains (''Sidetracked Again,'' Op-Ed, April 4).</p>
        <p>I live in Bellingham, Wash., and Amtrak runs right through my town heading south to Seattle and north to Vancouver. The train runs through gorgeous forest and along the seashore, a short, beautiful and stressfree journey.</p>
        <p>But every time I ''go to the city,'' I end up alone in my car, fighting the murderous traffic on I-5.</p>
        <p>Why? Because the length of the train ride is often double or more the time scheduled, and I cannot depend on Amtrak getting me there in time for a concert or meeting.</p>
        <p>In these days of crammed highways, high gas prices and big environmental concerns, this simply doesn't make sense and can't be allowed to continue.</p>
        <p>Janet Johnston  Bellingham, Wash., April 4, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Steve Hallock complains that Amtrak trains have to give way for freight trains. This, he says, is a problem because it discourages people from riding Amtrak, and if they did so, they would use less energy than if they drove.</p>
        <p>But isn't the same thing true of freight trains? Freight trains use two to four times less oil per ton than semi rigs. Given that 69 percent of our oil consumption is for transportation, the lesson seems clear.</p>
        <p>We need to build a whole new infrastructure for transportation, and half measures will waste precious time as we enter the downside of the peak oil curve.</p>
        <p>Frank Logan  Ocean Park, Wash., April 4, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We need to control the rail system the same way that air traffic is controlled. With the federal government owning the rails or leasing them, there could be a central authority to direct what trains use what tracks and when. Public money could be used to maintain, improve and even expand the system.</p>
        <p>If the rails were opened to new transportation companies, these companies could then enter the market, pay for their use of the rails and provide services that the government may not want to provide -- for instance, express trains to limited destinations.</p>
        <p>Allowing the railroad companies to control the rails, even with ''greater authority to the Surface Transportation Board for track-use enforcement,'' as proposed in the bipartisan legislation in Congress, will cause continuing conflict between passenger and freight service, limit the growth of the rail system and leave us in the same place we are now.</p>
        <p>Duncan B. Hume  Bethel, Conn., April 4, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Steve Hallock describes the unfortunate wrangling between our country's freight and passenger rail systems, and points out that the disagreements over track use create big obstacles for Amtrak as it does its best -- under great constraints -- to provide Americans with superb transportation.</p>
        <p>Compare this sorry state to a feat reported in your April 3 paper: A brilliant new French train has broken all prior rail records, going 357 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>Can our rail system ever come close to something extraordinary like that? Will Amtrak ever receive the full support of the current government, one that seems blind to the astounding economic and conservation benefits trains bring to the world?</p>
        <p>Fiona D.J. Bayly  New York, April 4, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Steve Hallock recommends legislative intervention to remedy one of Amtrak's many ailments. But if the past decades have taught us anything about Amtrak, it is most conclusively that simply no amount of government intervention will turn the beleaguered company into a prosperous endeavor.</p>
        <p>The Lautenberg-Lott bill will just be another strike cast against a dead horse.</p>

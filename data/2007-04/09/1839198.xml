        <p>Correction on March 27 article in Science Times about graduate students who have killed their professors, regarding case of Theodore Streleski, Stanford doctoral candidate who bludgeoned his adviser to death in 1978</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article in Science Times on March 27 about graduate students who have killed their professors referred incorrectly to the case of Theodore Streleski, a Stanford University student who bludgeoned Karel deLeeuw, a Stanford math professor, to death. At the time of the killing, Mr. Streleski's academic adviser was Halsey Royden, not Dr. deLeeuw. Mr. Streleski was told by Dr. Royden that his research was sufficient to earn him a doctorate if he wrote a dissertation; Mr. Streleski was not told that after 19 years of graduate school he was not going to get a doctorate.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>My 25-year-old son walked into our apartment on the Upper West Side a few weeks ago with a glum look on his face.</p>
        <p>''What happened?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''My MP3 player slipped off my earphones and fell through the grating in that building across the street!''</p>
        <p>''Don't give it up,'' I said. ''There're lots of things you can do to retrieve it.''</p>
        <p>I first suggested that he call 311 to find out his alternatives. They told him to go to a Web site that lists the addresses of buildings in Manhattan and the names of the supers (this one didn't have a doorman).</p>
        <p>He had already tried the apartment registry in the lobby to no avail, so he now tried reaching the super on the listed phone number. No luck. He left a message.</p>
        <p>He was about to give up when my husband suggested he try the age-old method we used as kids: attaching a wad of gum to a long broomstick and trying to retrieve the dropped object.</p>
        <p>My son brightened as he left the apartment with two broomsticks, preparing to buy a package of gum at the corner deli.</p>
        <p>After a return for another pole (it was deeper than he thought), and many odd looks and inquiries from passers-by and tenants from the building; he returned triumphantly.</p>
        <p>''I did it!'' he announced, the slightly soiled MP3 player in his hand.</p>
        <p>Another New York myth validated through reminiscence, imagination and hard work!</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>While working as a graphic designer for one of the last sheet-music publishers in the Times Square area, I often lunched at an inexpensive second-floor Chinese restaurant.</p>
        <p>I shall never forget a bit of wisdom from a fortune cookie I received one day: ''In case of fire, keep calm, pay bill, then run!''</p>
        <p>Borys Patchowsky</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>While walking on Atlantic Avenue near Third Street in Brooklyn, I came upon two creative street people with a sign that read:</p>
        <p>''Let's Do Lunch!</p>
        <p>You Buy !!!''</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Scene on the M57 bus early one morning: A young couple, obviously visitors to the city, entered the bus, map in hand. Their question to the driver: ''Is Times Square open today?''</p>
        <p>Phyllis Taub</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>In early December, I overheard this cellphone conversation while riding the 42nd Street crosstown bus:</p>
        <p>''Emily, just calm down. Nothing's going to get done now until after the first of the year.</p>
        <p>''Yes, Emily. I understand that you're upset. I know you're upset. I can tell.</p>
        <p>''Emily, I promise you if you don't have an apartment by February, we'll go to Hillary Clinton.''</p>
        <p>I'm still wondering if Emily got her apartment.</p>
        <p>Carol Tanenbaum</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>On a recent walk through Van Cortlandt Park, I encountered a red-tailed hawk. As I walked across a field bordering some woods, the bird circled over my head, then perched on an oak branch high above.</p>
        <p>I gazed up at her, and she returned my stare for a few minutes. Then she swooped down directly at me and leveled off to a glide no more than 20 feet over my head.</p>
        <p>For an instant, I thought I'd have to protect myself; it gradually dawned on me that the hawk regarded me as an intruder.</p>
        <p>Leaving the park, I approached my car and observed the simultaneous arrival of two cars at one parking space. The first car had driven up, while the other made a broken U-turn, targeting the space. Both drivers honked several times and then glared at each other. Neither seemed willing to move.</p>
        <p>I drove away, reflecting on a common trait displayed by two otherwise very different-looking species.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Has anyone else noticed a certain ironic juxtaposition seen from the southbound lanes of the Henry Hudson Parkway, around 158th Street?</p>
        <p>At a bend in the road, there's a moment when the glorious spires of Riverside Church appear straight ahead, with the enormous subtitle ''Wicked'' appearing directly beneath them.</p>
        <p>How's that for placement of a Broadway poster?</p>
        <p>Richard Holt</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>When driving to Long Island I came to a toll plaza and tossed a token toward the basket. I missed, and the token fell to the ground. A guard standing next to the booth saw what I had done, leaned over, picked up the token and, as he placed it in the basket, said:</p>
        <p>''You must play for the Knicks.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 16, 2007, Monday  A report in the Metropolitan Diary last Monday referred incorrectly to the location in Brooklyn where two street people were seen holding a sign that said ''Let's Do Lunch! You Buy!!!'' It was on Atlantic Avenue near Third Avenue, not Third Street. (Atlantic and Third Street do not intersect.)</p>

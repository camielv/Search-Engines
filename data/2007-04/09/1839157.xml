        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You are right to critique the disturbing pattern of growing income inequality in the United States (''It Didn't End Well Last Time,'' editorial, April 4).</p>
        <p>Today we have, by far, the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country, and the gap between the rich and poor is growing wider. This is an issue that Congress has ignored for too long and that must be addressed.</p>
        <p>We don't need any more speeches from the White House on ''family values'' when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. What we do need is a change in national priorities.</p>
        <p>We should rescind the hundreds of billions in tax breaks that President Bush has given the wealthiest 1 percent, and use that money to begin addressing the long-neglected problems of our children and working families.</p>
        <p>Bernie Sanders  Washington, April 4, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is the Independent senator from Vermont.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your editorial also could have noted that there are state policies that can help. States have considerable authority to regulate the labor market and establish meaningful standards to ensure that workers receive a fair wage for a day's work.</p>
        <p>A recent report by Cornell researchers estimated that 10 percent of private workers in New York State are illegally misclassified as ''independent contractors.'' These workers are forced to pay both the employer and employee shares of payroll taxes. They also lose out on social protections, paid leave and fringe benefits like health coverage.</p>
        <p>New York State should begin a vigorous enforcement effort to stem this abuse.</p>
        <p>James A. Parrott  New York, April 5, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is deputy director of the Fiscal Policy Institute.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You document the growing income inequality in the United States. But wealth distribution -- what people own -- is a much more salient measure of growing inequality.</p>
        <p>Estimates indicate that the top 1 percent own between 40 percent and 50 percent of the country's wealth, more than the combined wealth of the bottom 95 percent. If you exclude owner-occupied housing, not a particularly liquid asset, and focus on financial assets and business equity, the figures are more concentrated.</p>
        <p>The distribution of wealth and income in the United States today is much more unequal than in any other advanced industrial country.</p>
        <p>Harold Jacobs  Palm Desert, Calif., April 4, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is a myth that ''middle-class and poor Americans use government services more than affluent Americans,'' as your editorial says.</p>
        <p>While wealthy Americans may not rely on food stamps and federally subsidized school lunches, they certainly do rely on the Coast Guard to protect them while using their pleasure boats, the National Guard to rescue them when they get stranded on Mount Hood, or federally subsidized flood insurance to protect their beachfront homes.</p>
        <p>Michael Rodriguez  Corvallis, Ore., April 4, 2007</p>

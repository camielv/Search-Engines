        <p>The White House Teams took place in Amsterdam last February. The 16 invited teams were divided into two groups of 8, with the top two in each section moving into the semifinals. Last month this column featured deals from one semifinal and the final. But the latest edition of the International Bridge Press Association's bulletin contains several other excellent deals from this event.</p>
        <p>Let's start with one that has its amusing side. It was the first board in the match between a German team of Michael Elinescu, Josef Piekarek, Alexander Smirnov and Entscho Wladow; and the team of Sabine Auken and Daniela von Arnim of Germany, Andy Robson of England and Zia Mahmood, a Pakistani who lives primarily in England but represents the United States in international events.</p>

        <p>The White House Teams took place in Amsterdam last February. The 16 invited teams were divided into two groups of 8, with the top two in each section moving into the semifinals. Last month this column featured deals from one semifinal and the final. But the latest edition of the International Bridge Press Association's bulletin contains several other excellent deals from this event.</p>
        <p>Let's start with one that has its amusing side. It was the first board in the match between a German team of Michael Elinescu, Josef Piekarek, Alexander Smirnov and Entscho Wladow; and the team of Sabine Auken and Daniela von Arnim of Germany, Andy Robson of England and Zia Mahmood, a Pakistani who lives primarily in England but represents the United States in international events.</p>
        <p>At the other table Zia was South. What do you think was his initial call?</p>
        <p>Elinescu (South) opened with the ''obvious'' five diamonds. Most players sitting North would raise to six diamonds, hoping that if the defense could immediately take two spade tricks, West would not find that lead. But Wladow wondered if seven diamonds could be made, so he responded five no-trump, which by partnership agreement invited a grand slam. Auken (East) doubled, worried that North was psyching with a weak hand, trying to talk her side out of its due.</p>
        <p>After two passes, note that if North had redoubled, the contract would have made for plus 1,240 (or 1,640, if East takes only one top spade). But North continued to probe with six clubs. South took a timeout, eventually finding the winning bid: seven diamonds. The subsequent double and redouble came almost through momentum.</p>
        <p>West found the heart lead that gave declarer a few nervous moments, but the contract was unbeatable. South ruffed one heart on the board and discarded his other heart loser on the club ace for plus 2,660.</p>
        <p>Anyone who knows Zia will not be surprised to hear that he passed as dealer. Smirnov (West) passed, Robson (North) opened one club, and Piekarek overcalled one spade. Zia settled for a quiet, nonforcing (because he was a passed hand) two-diamond response. West jumped to three spades, a pre-emptive action promising four-card support and few high-card points. (He would have cue-bid three diamonds with game-invitational strength.) North doubled to show extra values, East raised to four spades, and South jumped to six diamonds, which was passed out.</p>
        <p>Declarer had no trouble winning all of the tricks for plus 1,390, but his team lost 15 international match points.</p>
        <p>What was the result of the 14-board match? Zia's team won by 43 imps.</p>

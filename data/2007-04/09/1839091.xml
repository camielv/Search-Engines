        <p>ROTHSCHILD--Diane. Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York records with deep sorrow the death of our cherished member, Diane Rothschild. To her family and loved ones we express our profound sympathy. May beautiful memories bring comfort to those who mourn her passing. Rabbi David M. Posner Marcia Waxman, President George Asch, Secretary $(6$)ROTHSCHILD--Diane. Died peacefully at home, surrounded by family and loved ones, on April 3rd, 2007, after a courageous five year battle with lung cancer. Born in New York City, Diane spent her adult years in Manhattan and Sagaponack, NY. Upon graduating from Adelphi University, she began a long and distinguished career in advertising. She was the most awarded copy writer during her tenure at DDB and she went on to open Grace &amp; Rothschild with her partner Roy Grace, in 1986. She subsequently merged the agency into Della Femina Rothschild Jeary in 2000. In 2005 she was inducted into the One Club Creative Hall of Fame, one of only four women to receive that honor. After learning she had lung cancer she devoted her creative skills to creating a campaign for the Lung Cancer Alliance, designed to combat the stigma of lung cancer, and the resulting inequities of research funding. But most of all, those of us who loved her, will remember a beautiful, intelligent and gracious person, who always put others needs before her own, who was charming and witty, but never at the expense of others, and who was always compassionate and caring. We miss you so much already. Alan, Ali, Brenda and Lily. Donations will be gratefully accepted in her name for the Lung Cancer Alliance, Washington DC or The Lung Cancer Research Foundation, NYC.</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>David Zellnik's new play ''Serendib,'' at the Ensemble Studio Theater, is a celebration of the beta male: the soulful sort, human or primate, who triumphs even as he lacks Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf's DNA. How typically do beta males succeed in the laboratory of real life? Do alphas always overcome them? Are betas happier, less addled? And about those alphas: Are they genetically predisposed to their alpha-ness, or are environment and circumstance responsible for their aggressive, victory-or-nothing dispositions?</p>
        <p>These are some of the questions at the heart of Mr. Zellnik's comedy, which engages some big questions of evolutionary biology and social science as it falls victim to a grating cleverness. Mr. Zellnik centers his story on a group of scientists observing the behavior of monkeys in Sri Lanka. One scientist, Fischke (Joseph Adams), believes that monkeys are capable of happiness and sadness. He also believes that these emotions are codifiable and that the happiest animals are those living in democratic clans with low incidence of intragroup mayhem and stress.</p>

        <p>David Zellnik's new play ''Serendib,'' at the Ensemble Studio Theater, is a celebration of the beta male: the soulful sort, human or primate, who triumphs even as he lacks Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf's DNA. How typically do beta males succeed in the laboratory of real life? Do alphas always overcome them? Are betas happier, less addled? And about those alphas: Are they genetically predisposed to their alpha-ness, or are environment and circumstance responsible for their aggressive, victory-or-nothing dispositions?</p>
        <p>These are some of the questions at the heart of Mr. Zellnik's comedy, which engages some big questions of evolutionary biology and social science as it falls victim to a grating cleverness. Mr. Zellnik centers his story on a group of scientists observing the behavior of monkeys in Sri Lanka. One scientist, Fischke (Joseph Adams), believes that monkeys are capable of happiness and sadness. He also believes that these emotions are codifiable and that the happiest animals are those living in democratic clans with low incidence of intragroup mayhem and stress.</p>
        <p>His rival, Ramsov, a Russian played with cartoonish arrogance by P. J. Sosko, thinks that all of Fischke's inquiries amount to no more than namby-pamby research. (''I read your new work is on monkey happiness! Monkey happiness!'') Who really cares if monkeys are in a good mood or not?</p>
        <p>Ramsov is an alpha guy, and he has come to Sri Lanka to figure out whether the average number of years a monkey spends in a high-status position is determined by genome. We are supposed to find Ramsov an odious creature, but the trouble is, he makes a lot of sense. He is all for hard science over the anecdotal kind and appreciates real rigor and all the rest.</p>
        <p>The larger problem for Mr. Zellnik is his apparent boredom with the argument he is trying to lay out. The positions of the two men don't cancel each other out. There can be an alpha gene for monkeys, and there can also be happy monkeys. The real conflict between Fischke and Ramsov devolves into one over a girl. In a parallel, various puppet monkeys, elegantly made by Emily DeCola, are fighting over a girl too. And if that weren't just too cute enough, Mr. Zellnik adds a pair of publicity-crazed documentary filmmakers to the story, so that we can witness the observers being observed.</p>
        <p>The packaging is surely too tidy. But at the same time Mr. Zellnik has not shied away from intellectual ambition, and that is more than can be said for many emerging playwrights.</p>
        <p>''Serendib,'' part of the First Light Festival produced with the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, continues through April 22 at the Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Manhattan; (212) 247-4982.</p>

        <p>The Metropolitan Opera has a big impediment to producing Handel operas: its enormous auditorium. Both ''Rodelinda,'' which the Met first mounted in 2004 starring Renée Fleming, and ''Giulio Cesare,'' which opened on Friday in a revival of a staging by John Copley introduced in 1988, were originally presented by Handel in the King's Theater in London, which seated just 850. In principle the Met's 3,700-seat house is way too big for early-18th-century opera. Some of the most ravishing moments in ''Giulio Cesare'' are pensively lyrical arias accompanied by only a small complement of continuo instruments.</p>
        <p>Yet we are in an age of great Handel singers, among them the amazing countertenor David Daniels, who sings the title role in ''Cesare.'' The entire cast was excellent, notably the soprano Ruth Ann Swenson, a vocally exquisite Cleopatra; and, in a significant Met debut, the rich-toned Irish mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon, as Cornelia, the grieving widow of Caesar's Roman archrival, Pompey.</p>

        <p>The Metropolitan Opera has a big impediment to producing Handel operas: its enormous auditorium. Both ''Rodelinda,'' which the Met first mounted in 2004 starring Renée Fleming, and ''Giulio Cesare,'' which opened on Friday in a revival of a staging by John Copley introduced in 1988, were originally presented by Handel in the King's Theater in London, which seated just 850. In principle the Met's 3,700-seat house is way too big for early-18th-century opera. Some of the most ravishing moments in ''Giulio Cesare'' are pensively lyrical arias accompanied by only a small complement of continuo instruments.</p>
        <p>Yet we are in an age of great Handel singers, among them the amazing countertenor David Daniels, who sings the title role in ''Cesare.'' The entire cast was excellent, notably the soprano Ruth Ann Swenson, a vocally exquisite Cleopatra; and, in a significant Met debut, the rich-toned Irish mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon, as Cornelia, the grieving widow of Caesar's Roman archrival, Pompey.</p>
        <p>The Met's effort to make ''Rodelinda'' work in its house was enhanced by the director Stephen Wadsworth's nuanced and stage-filling production. Alas Mr. Copley's ''Cesare'' is faux-exotic and pointlessly fussy. The sets of marbleized moving walls and painted drops undergo constant and complicated maneuvers only to reveal other configurations of walls and drops. The movements of the singers are hampered by tacky costumes with swirling capes and cumbersome trains.</p>
        <p>Still, the Friday performance, conducted by Harry Bicket, a Baroque opera specialist, more than overcame the staging, allowing the richness and endless variety of the music and the piercing psychological insights of this staggering masterpiece to come through. With a libretto by Nicola Haym, the story is loosely based on Caesar's military campaign to finish off Pompey, who has taken refuge in Egypt. But Handel seized on the tale as a way to explore the timeless human intertwining of sex and politics.</p>
        <p>When the Met last presented this opera in the 1999-2000 season, Cesare was sung by a mezzo-soprano, Jennifer Larmore, and Mr. Daniels made his company debut as Cornelia's son Sesto. But he was born to the daunting title role.</p>
        <p>As always, this remarkable artist sang with uncanny agility, his clarion countertenor voice sounding at once tender and virile. He brought incisive attack to the fiery passagework in the defiant arias. But his plaintive singing when Cesare broods over the cremated remains of Pompey and ponders the intransigence of life and the way natural allies can become ruthless enemies was especially memorable.</p>
        <p>This was a great night for the courageous Ms. Swenson. Just six weeks ago she finished a round of chemotherapy for breast cancer. And as she recently asserted in an interview, the new general manager of the Met, Peter Gelb, finds her a less compelling artist than some more recent additions to the Met in the coloratura soprano repertory. Her future at the house beyond next season looks iffy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Swenson may not be the most dramatically intense singer. In Cleopatra's first florid aria, ''Non disperar,'' when she belittles Tolomeo, her younger brother with whom she rules Egypt, as an amateur when it comes to power politics, Ms. Swenson did not fully convey the calculating wiles of the alluring queen.</p>
        <p>Yet she dispatched the music brilliantly, with nimble coloratura passagework, musicianly honesty and plummy sound. In Cleopatra's ruminative moments, like the haunting Act III aria in which the queen, now held prisoner by her brother, reflects on her torment, Ms. Swenson sang with elegant phrasing and affecting poignancy. Understandably she looked emotional during the ecstatic ovation she received at curtain-call time.</p>
        <p>As Tolomeo, Lawrence Zazzo, an American countertenor in his Met debut, was made up, for some reason, as a campy Cecil B. DeMille-style villain of ambiguous sexuality with a shaved head. Regardless, Mr. Zazzo, with his strong voice, sang with flair.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bardon brought noble bearing and refinement to her portrayal of the anguished Cornelia. Her sublimely sorrowful duet with the excellent British mezzo-soprano Alice Coote, as Sesto, should advance the cause of Irish-English relations when word reaches overseas. In his Met debut Michael Maniaci, a male soprano, was sweet-voiced as Nireno, Cleopatra's confidant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bicket drew stylish playing from the Met orchestra, reduced in size but fortified with period continuo instruments. Although there were moments of scrappy ensemble, this is a long score in an idiom in which the musicians do not play often.</p>
        <p>And what a stunning opera. In Act II, when Ms. Swenson's Cleopatra, disguised as the queen's attendant, spins entrancing lyrical lines in an act of seduction, Mr. Daniels's captivated Cesare sings, ''Not even heaven has a melody to equal such a song.'' He was right.</p>

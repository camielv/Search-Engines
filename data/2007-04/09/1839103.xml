        <p>The problem with cooking shows is that you have to watch people cook. There's slicing. There's sautéing. There's the occasional Busby Berkeley-style overhead shot of stock evaporating in a $350 pot. Sometimes a host says ''Bam!'' or drops a roast or peeks out from inside an oven. That's when things perk up.</p>
        <p>Mark Bittman doesn't even give you that. He is unremittingly understated, primarily as the Minimalist in the Dining section of The New York Times and now as the host of a 13-part public-television series, ''The Best Recipes in the World.'' Let's be kind and call him down-to-earth.</p>

        <p>The problem with cooking shows is that you have to watch people cook. There's slicing. There's sautéing. There's the occasional Busby Berkeley-style overhead shot of stock evaporating in a $350 pot. Sometimes a host says ''Bam!'' or drops a roast or peeks out from inside an oven. That's when things perk up.</p>
        <p>Mark Bittman doesn't even give you that. He is unremittingly understated, primarily as the Minimalist in the Dining section of The New York Times and now as the host of a 13-part public-television series, ''The Best Recipes in the World.'' Let's be kind and call him down-to-earth.</p>
        <p>Yet he is easy to watch, for the same reasons his column is so admirable (he always tells you something useful) and his many cookbooks so practical (the recipes seem never to fail). He isn't annoying. He doesn't get in anybody's way.</p>
        <p>Watch him with Mario Batali or Gary Danko or even an unknown paella cook in Spain's rice-growing region. (Does Mr. Bittman understand Spanish? Indeed.) Everybody likes having him around, surely because he never acts as if he knows very much, and all of us who admire his work realize that he knows almost everything.</p>
        <p>There's a lovely moment in Episode 1, ''Rice With Things,'' when he's in New York cooking an asparagus risotto with Mr. Batali. (One quibble: Can a risotto with a big glob of asparagus purée added at the end really be the best risotto recipe in the world?)</p>
        <p>Mr. Batali is tossing in grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. He doesn't measure. He asks Mr. Bittman, ''Was that a quarter cup?'' Mr. Bittman tells him it was more like a half cup. Mr. Batali says, ''That's why your books work and mine don't, I guess.''</p>
        <p>The series is enhanced by its unpretentiousness. When the wardrobe department called, Mr. Bittman must have been out wringing the neck of a chicken. His attire is mostly baseball caps, jeans and horizontally striped T-shirts -- sometimes with long sleeves, sometimes short.</p>
        <p>The script department also seems to have put in limited time.</p>
        <p>In ''Rice With Things'' he's seen in the harbor of Valencia, Spain, driving a speedboat -- add that to his accomplishments -- and quipping, rather appallingly, ''But we're not here for the fast boats -- or even the fast women.''</p>
        <p>Later in the show Mr. Danko says, ''No doubt about it, Mark, your food always is cheesy.'' Actually the scripted dialogue is the cheesiest part of the series. Unprompted moments, when Mr. Bittman is one on one with farmers or chefs or, best of all, Mr. Batali, are amiable and often delightful.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bittman does a particularly workmanlike job in Program 2, ''Pure Porcine Pleasures,'' chatting with Fergus Henderson, the chef of St. John Restaurant in London. Mr. Henderson has Parkinson's disease and is difficult to engage in conversation. I know. I've tried.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bittman's patience, aided by his obvious admiration for Mr. Henderson, prevails.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, not a great deal of hard-core cooking goes on. That's quite an achievement, inasmuch as the title of the series makes it sound as if it would be about nothing but preparing recipes. Not only are the cooking segments rudimentary, they're not even particularly practical.</p>
        <p>That paella expert in Spain will teach you how to control a fire made from the wood of orange trees. I doubt that's of value unless you happen to live in central Florida.</p>
        <p>The idea of the series, you eventually learn, is for the viewer to go to a Web site, thebestrecipesintheworld.com, for specifics on how to make the dishes. Then you can make authentic paella with rabbit and snails, should you be so inclined, or Mr. Bittman's concoction of leftover rice, freshly grated zucchini, butter and two kinds of cheese. An unimpressed Mr. Danko says it tastes likes rice and cheese. He also points out that it's fattening. Mr. Bittman doesn't seem to mind.</p>
        <p>''The Best Recipes in the World'' is really a traveling celebrity chef show, a concept currently in vogue. (Episode 4, ''Wide World of Wine,'' opens with Mr. Batali lurking in a vineyard with a scarf hiding his face.) Much as in Mr. Bittman's cooking columns, you'll pick up random bits of interesting information; in Episode 1 he tells you that half the people in the world eat rice at least twice a day.</p>
        <p>I didn't know that.</p>
        <p>Unlike the wardrobe and script departments the people in charge of locales did well. The shows are scenic and evocative, and you'll surely wish you were with Mr. Bittman, wherever he happens to be.</p>
        <p>As a cook, he's always been a kind of culinary handyman, absolutely reliable, incapable of letting you down. You suspect he'd be just as valuable as a traveling companion.</p>

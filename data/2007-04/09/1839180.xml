        <p>A fire in high-rise Bronx apartment building injured 26 people and 10 firefighters last night, fire officials said. Five of the occupants were in serious condition.</p>
        <p>Fire officials said the blaze started shortly before 9 p.m. with a gas explosion in a first-floor apartment of the building, at 1749 Grand Concourse near East 175th Street.</p>
        <p>Earlier yesterday, a quick-moving fire on Staten Island swept across hundreds of yards of brush before destroying one house and damaging several others as people ran from the 70-foot-high flames and blinding black smoke, witnesses and fire officials said.</p>
        <p>In the Bronx fire, Yulissa Vicente, 16, who lives on the first floor, said residents ''were panicking. They were rushing people to get down the stairs. There was a three-story backup of people trying to get down.''</p>
        <p>Her sister, Julietta Vicente, 18, said, ''The explosion was so strong, it blew off the fire escapes.'' She escaped by being lowered from the remaining portion of the fire escape into the arms of people below. ''My father grabbed us by our hands. They grabbed us by our feet,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Five of the injured firefighters were taken to Jacobi Medical Center, and five were taken to NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. Five of the 26 injured residents refused medical attention at the scene.</p>
        <p>Last night, many residents were able to return to the building's 275 apartments because the damage had been limited to three units on the lower floors.</p>
        <p>Despite the property damage, no serious injuries were reported in the four-alarm Staten Island blaze, in the Midland Beach section of the island. One resident was treated at a nearby hospital for smoke inhalation, and a firefighter and a police officer were treated at the scene for minor injuries, a fire official said.</p>
        <p>The Staten Island fire, in the area of Slater and Olympia Boulevards, melted plastic fences and the shell of an above-ground swimming pool, and it charred and twisted home siding and window frames. A car was destroyed in one yard; in another, the charred frame was all that remained of a boat parked in a yard.</p>
        <p>Ray Fletcher, 55, a registered nurse who lives on Seaver Avenue, said he was watching the Yankees game in his pajamas yesterday when the fire started shortly before 2 p.m. ''I watched A-Rod hit a two-run home run, and it turned dark outside,'' he said. ''It was like day turned to night.''</p>
        <p>His home, at the end of a street that dead-ends at the brushy area, seemed about to be consumed, he said, so he quickly put on jeans and a jacket and fled. ''I ran through yards, thinking, 'Is this how it's going to end?' '' he said.</p>
        <p>But all he seemed to have lost was his 2000 Chevrolet Tracker, he said. It was the second vehicle he has lost to fire at his home here. He said the blaze yesterday was the third serious fire that he remembered in the area in 12 years.</p>
        <p>The fire yesterday began in the brush, and its cause remained under investigation, with careless children or an errant cigarette butt the most likely answers, said a fire official, Deputy Chief William Tanzosh.</p>
        <p>Chief Tanzosh said more than 10 houses were damaged, though it appeared that only one, a vacant bungalow on Seaver Avenue, was destroyed. It took the 50 units that responded to the four-alarm fire two hours to get it under control, he said.</p>
        <p>''It's a tremendously taxing thing to get your hands around a situation like this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Residents counted their blessings.</p>
        <p>Viktor Zadorozhnyy, 55, was home with his family on Quincy Avenue when he saw the fire cross about 300 yards of brush in four minutes, straight to his backyard, he said. But the family did not flee. ''This is my house,'' he said. ''It's all I have.''</p>
        <p>When the flames were quite close, he finally went outside with his family, his dog and his cat, he said, but he never left his property. The flames melted their siding, pool and fence, and left ash and debris in the yard and the strong smell of smoke.</p>
        <p>His son, 27-year-old Dan Archerdiff last name , said, ''I didn't have time to be frightened because I was so preoccupied with this. I got frightened later when I realized how lucky we were, and we could have been without a house.''</p>
        <p>John Fanelli, 40, a truck driver, and his wife, Kim, 38, heard warnings from their yard and a neighbor's before they saw anything.</p>
        <p>''Our dog and their dog started going berserk before anybody was aware,'' Mr. Fanelli said.</p>
        <p>He watched as the flames, which he said were 60 or 70 feet high, jumped across nearby Jefferson Avenue. ''I was hosing down my house. My next-door neighbor was hosing down his,'' Mr. Fanelli said. ''The winds were really bad.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 11, 2007, Wednesday  An article on Monday about a brush fire on Staten Island that routed residents from their homes gave an erroneous spelling in some copies for the surname of a man whose property was damaged. He is Dan Archer, not Archerdiff.</p>

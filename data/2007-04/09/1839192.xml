        <p>Grinderman  ''Grinderman'' (Mute/Anti-)</p>
        <p>Nick Cave has knocked about before without his longtime band, the Bad Seeds, usually producing roughly similar results. But Grinderman -- his new collaboration with Martyn Casey on bass, Jim Sclavunos on drum and Warren Ellis on electric bouzouki, violin and guitars -- has the heft of something other than a spinoff. The group's self-titled debut is a 40-minute slog of coarseness and vexation. And it sounds terrific, in a turbulent fashion.</p>

        <p>Grinderman  ''Grinderman'' (Mute/Anti-)</p>
        <p>Nick Cave has knocked about before without his longtime band, the Bad Seeds, usually producing roughly similar results. But Grinderman -- his new collaboration with Martyn Casey on bass, Jim Sclavunos on drum and Warren Ellis on electric bouzouki, violin and guitars -- has the heft of something other than a spinoff. The group's self-titled debut is a 40-minute slog of coarseness and vexation. And it sounds terrific, in a turbulent fashion.</p>
        <p>Though each of the band's members is a Bad Seed, their work in Grinderman gestures more toward the Stooges. ''Get It On'' pairs its call to arms with a predatory haze, while ''Depth Charge Ethel'' employs a serpentine bass line and a syncopated slash of cymbals and drums. The quieter tunes, notably ''Man in the Moon,'' suggest a punishing desolation.</p>
        <p>Lyrically Mr. Cave gets a lot of mileage here out of emphatic dumbness, though some lines -- like ''Every time I think of you I get sick'' -- strain the premise a bit. He probably wasn't being careless when he sequenced two consecutive songs that feature pale moonlight, but it's hard to say why he did. The saving grace is his gift for the unexpected poetic image, meted out in manageable doses and spiked with morbid wit.</p>
        <p>It all comes together on the band's current single, a talking blues with an unpublishable title. ''She just didn't want to,'' he grouses throughout the song, sounding more worked up with each refrain. But perhaps the most telling moment is a reminder ''that I must above all things love myself.'' He repeats this phrase too, sounding unconvinced.</p>

        <p>GRAHAM--Colin. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of director Colin Graham, whose imaginative staging of John Corigliano's The Ghosts of Versailles contributed so much to the success of that opera's world premiere here in 1991. We also remember him for two new productions of Britten's Death in Venice (U.S. premiere in 1974 and a second production 1994), as well as his La Traviata (1981), and Cosi fan tutte (1982). We offer our sincerest condolences to his family and friends. Peter Gelb, General Manager James Levine, Music Director</p>

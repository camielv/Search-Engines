        <p>Governor Spitzer's original budget proposal called for charging New York's nuclear power plants $13 million to help pay for the costs the state incurs from using its National Guard to provide extra security at the plants. But the energy companies that own the plants are major campaign contributors, and employ well-connected lobbyists in Albany to protect their interests.</p>
        <p>The proposal was killed by the Legislature.</p>
        <p>''This proposed fee places a financial burden on nuclear power companies for doing business in New York State,'' Senator James W. Wright, an upstate Republican who is chairman of the energy committee, said in a statement celebrating its defeat. ''Energy rates in New York State are already too high. The creation of this tax would have encouraged these companies to take their investments, jobs and power to other states.''</p>
        <p>Since 2004, Enpac, the political action committee of the Entergy Corporation, which owns the Indian Point nuclear power plant, has contributed more than $130,000 to state and local politicians and parties, campaign finance filings show. Of course, contributions do not always guarantee success: While the filings show that Enpac contributed to Senator Wright, they also show that it contributed to Governor Spitzer, above.</p>

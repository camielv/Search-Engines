        <p>Philips Electronics, Amsterdam, decided to keep its worldwide media account, with spending estimated at $600 million, at Carat, part of the Aegis Group. The decision came after a review that was narrowed to Carat and Mediaedge:cia, part of the WPP Group.</p>
        <p>Chrysler Group, Auburn Hills, Mich., part of DaimlerChrysler, shifted the national creative duties for Jeep to Cutwater, San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group, from the Troy, Mich., office of BBDO Worldwide, also part of Omnicom. About half the estimated $350 million that Jeep spends each year is devoted to national ads. BBDO retains the rest of the Jeep account, including dealer ads and direct marketing. The decision came after a review that included BBDO, Cutwater and other Omnicom agencies.</p>

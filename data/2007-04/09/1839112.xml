        <p>Picasso's flashlight draws a centaur in the air, Matisse's brush hovers over the paper before committing itself to the first stroke, Jackson Pollock pours arcs of thick paint: all famous examples of the artist's hand caught on film in the act of creation, in a particular kind of theater.</p>
        <p>And exactly this theatricality is the hallmark of William Kentridge, the South African artist who at nearly 52 is an unlikely star of the international art scene. Mr. Kentridge's medium is charcoal: he draws an image, photographs it, erases and redraws it many times to create evocative video animations that at once tell stories and convey the narrative of the act of drawing.</p>
        <p>From here to live theater is a small step, one Mr. Kentridge has now attempted on his largest scale yet. After a series of puppet operas (including a moving adaptation of Monteverdi's ''Ritorno d'Ulisse,'' seen in New York in 2004) he undertook in 2005 a full production of Mozart's ''Magic Flute'' for La Monnaie, the Royal Opera House in Belgium. That production opens tonight at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p>
        <p>The result is an exuberant dialogue between drawing and music, a three-dimensional work of art with video projected across and around the human figures onstage. Sometimes the animations echo the characters' thoughts; mathematical diagrams stand in for the teachings of Sarastro and his priests. Sometimes they reflect the music, with white lines reaching upward during a chorus, like fireworks. Sometimes they form antic glosses, suddenly coalescing into birds, a lion, a dancing rhinoceros.</p>
        <p>Avant-garde? Not a bit. What makes Mr. Kentridge unlikely in the art world is his down-to-earth accessibility. His best-known video works, like ''History of the Main Complaint'' (involving two recurring characters, Soho Eckstein and Felix Teitlebaum, navigating post-apartheid South Africa), are at once quirkily idiosyncratic and easy to grasp.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kentridge's ''Magic Flute'' is based on the metaphor of the early camera, using the palette of a film negative, white on black, to reflect the opera's shifting presentation of good and evil.</p>
        <p>While it is studded with ideas and concepts, it is hardly the kind of experimental production European audiences are used to. (Some critics of the Brussels premiere found it too straightforward.)</p>
        <p>A fairy tale rich in symbolism, ''The Magic Flute'' has attracted plenty of artists through the ages, from Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed sets for an 1815 production, to Oskar Kokoschka, Marc Chagall, Maurice Sendak and David Hockney. Mr. Kentridge's staging harks back to Schinkel's, citing his Egyptian imagery and the Queen of the Night's starry firmament. To find his own imagery, however, he started producing drawings and videos years before the opening, works that have since been shown in their own right, at the Marian Goodman Gallery in New York and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>In a phone conversation from his studio in Johannesburg, Mr. Kentridge described the opera as being ''about the power of music at the service of love'' and ''another Orpheus story.'' (His Tamino charms savage beasts with his flute.) As an artist, Mr. Kentridge naturally translated it into a visual metaphor, that of the film negative.</p>
        <p>''The opera is about the difference between darkness and light,'' he said. ''Sarastro becomes the sun; we are left with blinding light. But in cinema blinding light means there is no more film in the projector; one is left without any meaning. There is a need for both darkness and light for meaning to be made.''</p>
        <p>Some of the opera's action (set in a 19th-century world of colonialism and exploration) takes place inside a camera. The other principal bearer of meaning is the blackboard, around which cluster Sarastro's followers, a kind of Royal Geographic Society. Mr. Kentridge doesn't lose sight of the veiled threat behind the ostensible benevolence of colonialism.</p>
        <p>''George Bernard Shaw said that Sarastro's music is the only music that would sound right in God's voice,'' he said. ''This is very anxious-making about the divine.''</p>
        <p>He cited Sarastro's ''falsely reassuring tone,'' adding: ''In the years since the opera was written there are so many examples of Sarastro-like kings who think they have superior knowledge. You know how calamitous that is.''</p>
        <p>After his ''Flute'' had its premiere, Mr. Kentridge explored its ''political unconscious'' in a piece called ''Black Box'' for the Guggenheim Berlin that presented some of the disastrous consequences of the German colonialization of Africa, like the massacre of the Herero people in what is now Namibia in the early 20th century. He has since reworked his portrayal of Sarastro for the New York ''Flute'' production.</p>
        <p>Thus Mr. Kentridge's production is reworked, erased, redrawn, much as his artworks are. He has a considerable background in theater: a founder of the racially integrated Junction Avenue Theater Company in South Africa in the 1970s, he studied mime at the International Theater School Jacques Lecoq in Paris in the 1980s before beginning his work with the Handspring Puppet Company, on ''Ulisse'' and other pieces, in 1992. But his approach of feeling things out has not necessarily prepared him for the opera world, where, he says wryly, singers are used to ''the conductor arriving knowing exactly what he wants.'' (In Brussels that conductor was the opinionated René Jacobs, who presented his own approach, Mr. Kentridge said, as a fait accompli; Piers Maxim will conduct in New York.)</p>
        <p>''What I have to do when I work in collaboration,'' Mr. Kentridge said, is to ''put in place a structure which allows my uncertainty to hold its own against everybody else's certainty.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kentridge is already looking toward his next opera production: Shostakovich's ''Nose,'' with Valery Gergiev, for the Metropolitan Opera in 2010. It should be a brilliant fit for Mr. Kentridge, who called it ''an extraordinary opportunity for looking at all kinds of things I've been interested in for years.''</p>
        <p>There is also plenty of room for a free hand.</p>
        <p>''The great thing about 'Nose,' '' he said, ''is that there are all these sections of just music, open to all kinds of exploration.''</p>
        <p>''The Magic Flute'' runs tonight through Saturday at the Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene; (718) 636-4100 or bam.org.</p>

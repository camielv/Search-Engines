        <p>Iran said Sunday that it was searching for a former F.B.I. agent who has been missing in Iran for almost a month.</p>
        <p>A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mohammad Ali Hosseini, said Iran was pursuing the case and seeking clues about what had happened to him.</p>
        <p>The former F.B.I. agent, Robert Levinson, has been missing since March 11, when he was on the Iranian island of Kish. Mr. Levinson, an American citizen, was reported to be working on a film on the island.</p>
        <p>Kish belongs to Iran, but it is a free trade zone, and foreigners are not required to have a visa to go there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hosseini said Sunday during his weekly news conference that Iran had been in touch with the Swiss Embassy but that more information about Mr. Levinson was needed. Iran and the United States have had no diplomatic ties since the 1979 Islamic revolution, and the Swiss Embassy represents America's interests in Iran.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. said in a statement last week that Mr. Levinson was no longer employed by the F.B.I., Reuters reported. He had focused on criminal cases, like organized crime, the statement added. Mr. Levinson retired from the F.B.I. in 1998, The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>A State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said last week, when it was first reported that an American was missing in Iran, that there was no ''linkage between this case and any ongoing cases.'' He was referring to the 15 British sailors and marines who were being held by Iran at that time, accused of having strayed into Iranian waters.</p>

        <p>While state lawmakers give taxpayer money to anti-gun organizations in the new budget, they also give grants to gun and hunting clubs.</p>
        <p>Then there is $2,000 for nut allergy awareness, $100,000 for a soccer hall of fame and $10,000 for a boxing hall of fame, not to mention $5,000 for a roller hockey club in Lynbrook, on Long Island, and much more for Little League and Pop Warner football teams throughout the state, depending on legislators' clout. Lawmakers also give tens of thousands of dollars to interest groups like AARP and the Empire State Pride Agenda, which lobby elected officials.</p>
        <p>Yes, there is pork aplenty in the first budget passed under Gov. Eliot Spitzer -- $170 million worth of pet projects divvied up by the Assembly and the Senate in a budget with a spending increase three times the rate of inflation.</p>
        <p>Still, after several years during which pork-barrel spending was decided behind closed doors by George E. Pataki and the legislative leaders, pet projects are once again being delineated line by line. Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo has also set up new procedures for vetting the projects. On the other hand, there are no details identifying who sponsored any particular spending item in the budget or what the item is being used for, though each is identified by party and as coming from either the Senate or Assembly.</p>
        <p>There are some familiar recipients, including the Ohel Children's Home and Family Services, a Jewish charity closely tied to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. Ohel and affiliated groups receive more than $1 million in the new budget.</p>
        <p>Consistency can be a casualty. So, for instance, the Colonial Rifle and Pistol Club, on Staten Island, gets $5,000 from one lawmaker while New Yorkers Against Gun Violence gets $4,500 from another. Senate Republicans are sending $50,000 of taxpayer funds to Safari Club International, a Tucson-based hunting organization that among other things supports removing grizzly bears and gray wolves from the endangered species list.</p>
        <p>With the Legislature on vacation for the first two weeks of April, a Senate spokesman was not able to provide further details. Christina Perez, a spokeswoman for Safari, said most of the money would be used to teach children about firearms safety and to help pay for a prisoner rehabilitation program that the group helps run at the Wyoming Correctional Facility in Attica, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''The last $5,000 goes for wood for their blue-boxes program,'' Ms. Perez said of Safari's New York affiliate. ''They build nests for bluebirds and give them away.''</p>

        <p>Just over a year ago, Wilburn Ashe stood outside his minister's home in Selmer in southwest Tennessee. He could see the lights inside, but the door was locked and his knocks went unanswered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashe returned to church for Bible study without the minister, Matthew Winkler. Later, four other church members went to the house and let themselves in with a key. They found Mr. Winkler dead, sprawled in a bedroom with a shotgun wound, and no sign of his wife, Mary, or their three daughters.</p>
        <p>The discovery was only the first shock in a killing that thrust Selmer into headlines around the country. After the Alabama police found Mary Winkler and the children hundreds of miles away, she stunned the community again with the admission that she had shot her husband and fled.</p>
        <p>On Monday, after a year of speculation, jury selection is to begin in a McNairy County courthouse where Ms. Winkler, 33, will face trial on charges of first-degree murder.</p>
        <p>The killing left members of Mr. Winkler's church, the Fourth Street Church of Christ, searching for answers and, at times, seeking respite from the attention on their town.</p>
        <p>Over the last year, some details have emerged from court and news reports. But Mr. Ashe, 71, said the killing remained as much a mystery as it was the night he knocked on the Winklers' door.</p>
        <p>''We know there are three little girls that don't have a daddy, and for all practical purposes at the present time, they don't have a mama,'' he said. ''We know those things, and we know that Mary has said she did it. That's all I know. And all of it is sad.''</p>
        <p>The Winklers arrived in Selmer in 2005. Mr. Winkler, a minister's son, was energetic and lively, and the congregation grew. Church members said his wife seemed doting and domestic.</p>
        <p>The home was apparently not as tranquil as it appeared. Clark Freeman, Ms. Winkler's father, said in a televised interview in November that he suspected abuse, and that his daughter covered ''terrible bruises'' with makeup. Mr. Freeman, reached by phone last week, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>There may also have been strains over finances. Ms. Winkler's lawyers have said that the couple were caught up in an overseas swindle. Ms. Winkler had also deposited worthless overseas checks in a local bank, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Winkler's body was found, friends suspected a break-in and a kidnapping. Then, a day later, the police found the family van in Orange Beach, Ala. According to the police, Ms. Winkler confessed, saying she had ''snapped'' after arguing with her husband over money.</p>
        <p>The killing stirred a frenzy of news coverage as reporters and television crews descended on Selmer.</p>
        <p>''You'd have to be almost under a rock not to have known about this, with as much attention as it got last year,'' Mayor David Robinson said.</p>
        <p>In days after, the closeness of the church members became apparent. Ms. Winkler apologized to the congregation in a note, and some members visited her in jail. Pam Killingsworth went almost every Sunday until Ms. Winkler made bail in August, taking along photos and community updates.</p>
        <p>Even Ms. Winkler's in-laws, Dan and Diane Winkler, appeared forgiving: Dan stood up in his church in Huntingdon to say they loved their daughter-in-law, according to a church newspaper account.</p>
        <p>Dan and Diane Winkler -- who have custody of the three girls, Patricia, 9; Mary Alice, 7; and Breanna, 2 -- have since filed a $2 million wrongful death suit against Ms. Winkler. They did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>After Ms. Winkler posted $750,000 bail, she went to McMinnville, Tenn., about 65 miles southeast of Nashville, to live with friends and work at a dry cleaner. She made headlines again when a television station broadcast photographs of her taken on New Year's Eve, smoking at a restaurant with a beer in front of her.</p>
        <p>Ms. Killingsworth, who taught music to the Winkler children, said that she had tried to put the case behind her, but that it had proved hard to do as the trial drew near.</p>
        <p>''It's just something you don't get over in a year's time,'' she said. ''I don't even know if you'll get over it in a lifetime.''</p>

        <p>9 P.M. (NBC) THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE -- Jennifer Coolidge, in front at left, Bryan Cranston, Joel McHale and Wayne Knight are the first brave souls to compete in this improvisational comedy series. Each week four actors walk into a live sketch to the words ''Thank God you're here!'' Dave Foley, as judge, gives the thumbs up or down. David Alan Grier is host. A second round with Mo'Nique, Edie McClurg, Richard King and Kevin Nealon will be shown at 10. The show, which originated in Australia, moves into its regular 8 p.m. Wednesday slot on April 18.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (ABC Family) FALCON BEACH -- With ''The O.C.'' gone, this series about buffed beach bums and teenage angst could gain some fans. In the season premiere the troubled Lane (Morgan Kelly) claims the Tanner marina for the Bradshaw resort, and Paige Bradshaw (Jennifer Kydd) comes home to the rescue.</p>
        <p>8:30 P.M. (CBS) THE NEW ADVENTURES OF OLD CHRISTINE -- Christine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) accidentally sends an e-mail message about Mr. Harris to all of the parents at Ritchie's school. Meanwhile she learns that Richard's friend Tom (Dave Foley, doing duty on two networks tonight; see above) has a crush on her.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Lifetime) JUDICIAL INDISCRETION -- A dishy federal judge (Anne Archer) learns she is on the president's short list for a seat on the Supreme Court. That's before her lover turns out to be a male prostitute.</p>
        <p>9:30 P.M. (CBS) THE KING OF QUEENS -- Carrie (Leah Remini) convinces Doug (Kevin James) that Deacon and Kelly could afford to buy a second home. Why? Because they're cheap and have sponged off the Heffernans all these years. The episode, the first of seven, begins the show's final-season countdown.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (FX) THE RICHES -- Wayne (Eddie Izzard) tries to deal with a few of the wrinkles in his assumed identity by cleaning up one of Hugh's shady deals, while Dahlia (Minnie Driver) amuses herself by taking a job as a dental hygienist. Ouch.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (National Geographic) INSIDE THE I.R.S. -- April is the cruelest month. Just ask the employees of the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (MTV) RUN'S HOUSE -- Joseph Simmons -- that's the Rev. Run to you -- opens the door to his Saddle River, N.J., home, not far from his brother Russell's abode, for a third season of hip-hop-tinged family values and religiosity. The starring brood: Rev. Run, above, who is a minister, a Phat Farm executive and one-third of the rap group Run-DMC; his wife, Justine; his daughters, Vanessa, an actress and model, and Angela, a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology; and the boys: Jojo, Diggy and Russy, all of whom want to follow in their father's big footsteps.</p>
        <p>10:30 P.M. (CMT) 2007 CMT MUSIC VIDEO OF THE YEAR SPECIAL -- Kellie Pickler introduces the eight nominated videos and interviews with performers in this prelude to the 2007 CMT Music Awards, on April 16.</p>
        <p>11:35 P.M. (CBS) LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN -- Senator Barack Obama and Halle Berry.</p>

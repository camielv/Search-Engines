He is survived by his wife, Cloty of 53 years, his children Nancy and Tom, his daughter - in - law Catherine, and grandsons Philip and Matthew, who remember a man of great good humor, gentleness and generosity. He illuminated the days of his family with love, and those of his many friends with story telling, hospitality and fellowship. His favorite verse of the Bible was ''Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares''.</p>

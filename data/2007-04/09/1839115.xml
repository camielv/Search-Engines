        <p>''If you don't know me by now,'' runs the opening line of a famous song by Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, ''you will never, never, never know me.'' This could be about the core classical-music repertory, certainly from the point of view of anyone who has gone through a competition, in which pieces are reduced to one-word tags (as in ''the judges would like to hear the Beethoven'').</p>
        <p>So Ilya Yakushev, who won the 2005 World Piano Competition in Cincinnati, didn't need to go into any detail about his recital at Alice Tully Hall on Saturday night. The pieces were simply listed in the program -- a Haydn sonata in D, Prokofiev's Sonata No. 7, Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition'' -- without any elaboration on things like movements. After all, if you don't know these works by now, what are more words really going to tell you? So what if you're hazy on the order of the pictures in Mussorgsky's show. The real point, from the standpoint of a competition, is to hear what the pianist can do in them.</p>

        <p>So Ilya Yakushev, who won the 2005 World Piano Competition in Cincinnati, didn't need to go into any detail about his recital at Alice Tully Hall on Saturday night. The pieces were simply listed in the program -- a Haydn sonata in D, Prokofiev's Sonata No. 7, Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition'' -- without any elaboration on things like movements. After all, if you don't know these works by now, what are more words really going to tell you? So what if you're hazy on the order of the pictures in Mussorgsky's show. The real point, from the standpoint of a competition, is to hear what the pianist can do in them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yakushev can do just about anything he wants. In the Haydn that meant finding in a Steinway the tinkling, busy-sounding alter ego of its predecessor, the fortepiano, a quality that resounded through the fast passagework of the first and third movements, though it yielded to a dark, mellow romanticism in the second. In the notoriously difficult Prokofiev, the instrument took on a whole different character, ringing and martial yet tinged with this composer's brand of lighthearted irony. Mr. Yakushev showed superb control, bringing the music to the brink of hysteria and the piano's capacity for noise making, without ever letting it get away from him. And he was able to make a repeated single note resound more pointedly than the fabric of quieter chords surrounding it.</p>
        <p>He also showed a consistent gentleness, a fluid touch even in forceful passages that let the music flow with legato and smoothed its edges, though it didn't mask them.</p>
        <p>For all of his fortissimo playing, particularly in Mussorgsky's ''Pictures'' (its harmonies touched with a slight sourness, like pumpernickel), it was sometimes hard to get a true sense of climax. Or perhaps it was simply hard to get away from the sense that this competition winner was phenomenally schooled, controlled and polished; hard, in short, truly to get to know him.</p>

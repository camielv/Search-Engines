        <p>EIZENSTAT--Sylvia. We extend our deepest sympathy to Stu and Fran Eizenstat and their family on the passing of Stu's mother, Sylvia, on April 5th. She passed away at 93 after a full and happy life. She was a source of unending love and inspiration for her closely knit family and friends. Graveside services were in Atlanta, and Shiva will continue at the Eizenstat home in Chevy Chase, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday nights. Contributions may be made to the Eizenstat Memorial Lecture Fund, Ahavath Achim Synagogue, 600 Peachtree Battle Ave., NW, Atlanta 30327.

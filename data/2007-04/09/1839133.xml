        <p>Up-tempo country songs bring in listeners when they first hit the airwaves, while new slow songs have no net effect. That is the conclusion of a seven-month study that examined audience fluctuations at one country station in Houston, KILT, as the station introduced 47 songs last year.</p>
        <p>This result is surprising, because some of the best-known country songs are slow ballads. But Jon Coleman, a radio consultant who worked on the study, said that music buyers and radio listeners wanted different things. ''People use radio for a pick-me-up boost of energy,'' he said. ''I think the ballads and softer music are songs that people buy and connect with emotionally.''</p>

''I think the ballads and softer music are songs that people buy and connect with emotionally.''</p>
        <p>The study also found that all new songs -- slow or fast -- benefit from time on the air. The first 100 times it was played, the average new country song of any tempo created a 0.4 percent bump in listenership. By the 400th to 500th spin, the bump had grown to 4.1 percent.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted jointly by Mr. Coleman's firm; Media Monitors, which tracks songs and commercials on the radio; and Arbitron, which measured the ratings by fitting 2,100 people with portable monitors that tracked their radio listening.</p>

        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-9</p>
        <p>New Iraq Plan Shows Signs Of Slowing Death Squads  Nearly two months into the new Baghdad security push, there has been some success in reducing the number of death squad victims each day. While over all death rates for all of Iraq have not dropped significantly, a few parts of the capital have become calmer as some death squads have decided to lie low.  A1</p>
        <p>Moktada al-Sadr, the Shiite cleric and power broker, exhorted Iraqi security forces to unite with his militiamen to show their objections to the American military in Diwaniya, an embattled southern city in Iraq. He did not go so far as to call for violent confrontation.  A8</p>
        <p>Freed Britons May Sell Stories  Some of the 15 British sailors and marines captured and released by Iran seemed to have decided they have a story to sell. In a highly unusual decision, Britain's Ministry of Defense acknowledged that it had agreed to permit them to offer their experiences for sale to newspapers and television stations. A9</p>
        <p>Captors Give Israel Demands  Hamas militants said that they had sent Israel a list of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for an Israeli soldier they have held for over 10 months. Israeli news media quoted unidentified Israeli officials as saying that they had received the list, but a spokesman for the prime minister's office would not confirm the reports.  A9</p>
        <p>Captain Cites Currents in Crash  The captain of a cruise ship that slammed into a volcanic reef before sinking off the island of Santorini blamed strong sea currents for the crash, Greece's state-run television reported. A4</p>
        <p>Iran Searches for Ex-U.S. Agent  A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mohammad Ali Hosseini, said Iran was searching for a former F.B.I. agent, Robert Levinson, who has been missing in Iran for almost a month. He disappeared when he was on the Iranian island of Kish, where he was reported to be working on a film. A9</p>

        <p>Army Sharply Increases Prosecution of Deserters  Army prosecutions of desertion and other unauthorized absences have risen sharply in the last four years, resulting in thousands more negative discharges and prison time for both junior soldiers and combat-tested veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>Hunger Strike at Guantánamo  A new hunger strike has broken out at the American detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, with more than a dozen prisoners subjecting themselves to daily force-feeding to protest their treatment, military officials and lawyers for the detainees said.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>Ranchers Fight Land Acquisition  In Colorado, a proposed expansion of the Army's Piñon Canyon Maneuver Site threatens to uproot local ranchers, who are set to testify before state lawmakers in support of a bill that would keep the Army from acquiring nearly a half-million acres for training grounds.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>Gingrich Criticizes Gonzales  Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich became the latest Republican to criticize Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales for the dismissals of eight United States attorneys and said Mr. Gonzales should consider resigning.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>Trial in Minister's Death  Jury selection begins today in McNairy County, Tenn., in the unusual case involving a woman who is accused in the killing of her husband, a minister.</p>

        <p>Construction to Resume On New Subway Line  The Second Avenue subway, which has had at least three groundbreakings in the last 40 years, is getting another on Thursday when Gov. Eliot Spitzer gives a speech and hoists a pickax, symbolically beginning construction again where it left off three decades ago. A1</p>
        <p>Program for Black Students  While many school districts have long worked to close the achievement gap between minority and white students, the Ossining, N.Y., school system has placed its second- and third-grade African-American boys in a special mentoring program in an effort to get black male students to college. A1</p>
        <p>Town Succumbs to Sprawl  The 400-acre Washington Town Center near Trenton, designed as a remedy to suburban sprawl, has become a victim of its own success: So many families have flocked to Washington Township that the schools are overflowing, property taxes are skyrocketing and the main streets are clogged.

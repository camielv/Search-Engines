        <p>Kendrick Scott Oracle  ''The Source''  (World Culture Music)</p>
        <p>Kendrick Scott is a jazz drummer conversant in an ultramodern sense of propulsion: lightweight yet heavy-gauge, with room for tumbling accents and textures. He has brought this feeling to a few contemporary groups, notably the one led by the trumpeter Terence Blanchard. Now he has planted it at the center of Oracle, a cohort of smart and sympathetic players.</p>

        <p>Kendrick Scott Oracle  ''The Source''  (World Culture Music)</p>
        <p>Kendrick Scott is a jazz drummer conversant in an ultramodern sense of propulsion: lightweight yet heavy-gauge, with room for tumbling accents and textures. He has brought this feeling to a few contemporary groups, notably the one led by the trumpeter Terence Blanchard. Now he has planted it at the center of Oracle, a cohort of smart and sympathetic players.</p>
        <p>''The Source,'' Mr. Scott's first album with the group, advances more than a rhythmic ideal: it consists almost entirely of his progressively sleek compositions. (And the lone cover, a Bjork song, is emblematic.) He makes his perspective clear on the opener, ''View From Above,'' a waltz that pairs the saxophonists Myron Walden and Seamus Blake in an intertwining melody, and features a cool investigation by the guitarist Mike Moreno.</p>
        <p>At times the album has a glow reminiscent of another drummer-led band, Brian Blade Fellowship. (''Psalm'' might stump even Mr. Blade.) What distinguishes Oracle is Mr. Scott's more pronounced attraction to groove.</p>
        <p>''Mantra'' presents a stealthy pulse in 5/4 meter; ''VCB,'' written with the pianist Robert Glasper, could be an interlude on a Q-Tip album. Those connections come as naturally to Mr. Scott as the post-bop he also explores, which explains why ''The Source'' works so well as a whole.</p>

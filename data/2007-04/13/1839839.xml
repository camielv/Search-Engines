        <p>In the world of spies Benjamin Tallmadge couldn't be further from James Bond. He didn't wield sophisticated weapons or drive a gadget-filled Aston Martin, and he most certainly was not a member of Her Majesty's -- or, in this case, His Majesty's -- Secret Service. A real rather than a fictional hero, Tallmadge practiced espionage the (very) old-fashioned way, doing his best to wrest the American colonies from the grip of George III.</p>
        <p>But Tallmadge (1754-1835), a Long Island native, was still an ingenious fellow, as families will discover tomorrow at the Fraunces Tavern Museum. Revolutionary War re-enactors representing his regiment, the Second Continental Light Dragoons (Tallmadge was an officer as well as George Washington's spy master), will recreate his times. ''The dragoons were the special ops of Washington's army,'' Sal Tarantino, the dragoons' captain, above, said in a phone interview. The re-enactors will perform drills and discuss Tallmadge's achievements, which included devising codes for transmitting information about British maneuvers in New York.</p>

        <p>In the world of spies Benjamin Tallmadge couldn't be further from James Bond. He didn't wield sophisticated weapons or drive a gadget-filled Aston Martin, and he most certainly was not a member of Her Majesty's -- or, in this case, His Majesty's -- Secret Service. A real rather than a fictional hero, Tallmadge practiced espionage the (very) old-fashioned way, doing his best to wrest the American colonies from the grip of George III.</p>
        <p>But Tallmadge (1754-1835), a Long Island native, was still an ingenious fellow, as families will discover tomorrow at the Fraunces Tavern Museum. Revolutionary War re-enactors representing his regiment, the Second Continental Light Dragoons (Tallmadge was an officer as well as George Washington's spy master), will recreate his times. ''The dragoons were the special ops of Washington's army,'' Sal Tarantino, the dragoons' captain, above, said in a phone interview. The re-enactors will perform drills and discuss Tallmadge's achievements, which included devising codes for transmitting information about British maneuvers in New York.</p>
        <p>''Some were numerical, some were alphabetical, and some were both,'' Mr. Tarantino said of the codes. Tallmadge also used invisible ink -- based on lemon juice, which turns brown when exposed to heat -- and a technique that involved burying a secret message in ordinary-looking correspondence. ''When you put a special template over the letter,'' Mr. Tarantino said, noting that such devices were shaped like triangles or hourglasses, ''you'd see the content of the message.''</p>
        <p>The dragoons won't be alone in reliving the 18th century. Visitors can try quill pens and Colonial games, and Linda Russell is to play period music for lessons in 1700s dances. And Selene Castrovilla will read from her new children's book, ''By the Sword'' (Calkins Creek Books), about Tallmadge's experiences in the Battle of Brooklyn. Although not as famous as that other Colonial Ben, he clearly made history too. (Noon to 5 p.m., Fraunces Tavern Museum, 54 Pearl Street, at Broad Street, Lower Manhattan, 212-425-1778, frauncestavernmuseum.org. Admission: $4; $3 for 6 through 17 and 65+; free for under 6 and members.)</p>

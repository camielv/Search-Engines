        <p>THE high cliffs and green hills of La Jolla, Calif., are undeniably gorgeous, but the show going on in the water below them was positively dizzying. Golden Garibaldi fish swam among swaying leaves of kelp; stingrays and a small shark kicked up grainy clouds of sand. A dark reef loomed amid imposing waves as we approached the headland.</p>
        <p>I was experiencing my first successful attempt at standup paddling on a surfboard, and the sensation of rowing upright across the glassy ocean without the energy of a swell made me feel like an astronaut on a spacewalk. Standing above the aquatic world like this turned surfing into an utterly new experience.</p>
        <p>The idea of surfing with an oar had intrigued me ever since I'd first seen photos of Maui's legendary big wave rider, Laird Hamilton, cruising down the long, perfect waves at Surfrider Beach in Malibu with a paddle. Later I met a standup paddle surfer during a big swell near Melbourne, Fla., who told me that the sport did wonders for his balance and let him gain more speed paddling for a wave. He also said that it made it far easier to spot sharks.</p>
        <p>After enviously watching that surfer catch waves from a point far beyond all the others, I decided to order a lightweight standup paddle -- single-bladed, six and a half feet long and made of carbon fiber -- from a company in Hawaii. I tried it out on a fat, stable 10-foot surfboard in the chilly waters near Charleston, S.C. It quickly became evident either that I didn't know what I was doing, or that even my big board was just too small for a novice.</p>
        <p>A week later I joined up with a crew of talented standup paddlers in San Diego, who were in town for the annual Action Sports Retailer show. The biggest buzz at this year's celebration of all things surf and skate came from the early forays of C4 Waterman, Surftech, Infinity and several other surfboard makers into the field of standup paddle surfing. On display were high-tech paddles and almost comically oversize longboards specifically created for this emerging sport.</p>
        <p>Standup paddling reportedly dates back to the 1920s and '30s, when Waikiki's Beach Boy surfers like the great Duke Kahanamoku paddled their huge Koa wood surfboards upright because it enabled them to keep their cameras dry for photographing wave-riding tourists. But like almost everyone now involved in the sport, my tutoring crew were fairly recent converts.</p>
        <p>My instructors were the renowned Hawaiian surfer Brian Keaulana; Scott Bass, the online editor of Surfer magazine; and the most experienced paddle surfer of the lot, Rick Thomas of San Diego. Mr. Keaulana said he grew up occasionally watching the family of Leroy Achoy -- a contemporary of Mr. Kahanamoku -- paddling into swells at Waikiki. But he preferred to concentrate on lifeguarding, stunt work, big-wave surfing and tandem surfing -- a discipline in which he is a current world champion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keaulana finally tried standup paddle surfing in Tahiti a few years ago, and said he was awestruck by the views of the mountains and teeming reefs -- and by the workout. ''I would go, 'Oh my God, my whole body is hurting,' '' he said. '' 'I've surfed for 8, 10 hours a day and never felt like this.' ''</p>
        <p>Rick Thomas's California experimentation with kayak paddles and a huge longboard began a few years ago off Cardiff Reef in San Diego, drawing the attention of Scott Bass and a crew of friends. In Mr. Bass's opinion, standup paddling is in the early stages of an explosion, and he is completely hooked. ''I don't even ride my regular longboard,'' Mr. Bass said. ''In fact, this is my longboard.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Thomas handed me a 12-foot-long, 5-inch-thick and 31-inch-wide Laird Hamilton model demo surfboard, I was amazed by its huge size and light weight. Amazement grew on the ocean. I dug in and easily knee-paddled straight into and over the small breakers. When Mr. Keaulana encouraged me to try standing up once beyond the waves, I simply jumped to my feet and stood there, somewhat baffled. The board didn't tip or purl. Though wobbly, I paddled and didn't fall.</p>
        <p>My partners quickly dissected my stance. If I bent my knees, straightened my back and moved slightly forward, balance would come more easily. Waving the paddle side-to-side so that it brushed across the surface of the water would create a stabilizing effect when standing still. Oh, and one other thing: I had been holding the blade of the paddle backward.</p>
        <p>WE slowly made our way south, 300 yards from shore, and paddling came more easily. Mr. Keaulana showed how to make more rapid turns by digging the paddle in on one side and quickly shifting weight to the back of the board. Though the ocean was rolling, I only fell a few times.</p>
        <p>A mile and a half south, the cliffs and far larger waves of La Jolla Cove rose up. My instructors used their paddles to spin their boards and row into incoming waves. On one long ride, Mr. Keaulana dug his paddle into the wave to anchor a hard turn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keaulana demonstrated how easy it was to dive under the waves by ditching the board in the face of an incoming wave and digging in underwater with the paddle. With the force generated by the paddle, you could remain essentially stationary even if a big wave was pulling you and your board shoreward. When the wave or set of waves passed, you could simply reel in your board via the leash attached to your ankle, climb on and start paddling again.</p>
        <p>After some intensive coaching back among the smaller waves near the sandy beach, I struggled for 20 minutes to catch a wave. Compared with the lazy, scenic paddle out, it was an intense challenge to navigate and pick out the right incoming swell. With the tide dropping, the translucent waves broke quickly, magnifying the shallow bottom but only granting me one short, blissful ride. It left me hungry for more.</p>
        <p>A week later, I checked out a demo board made by Steve Boehne at Infinity Surfboards in Dana Point, up the road from La Jolla. Mr. Boehne sells about 10 standup boards a week at more than $1,000 each. ''I think everyone's going to have one soon,'' said Jon Steele, a photographer and native of the Texas coast. ''I'm thinking of how perfect these boards are both as fishing platforms and riding the mushy Texas waves.''</p>
        <p>I rolled up at the south end of San Onofre surfing beach in San Clemente to find five other standup paddlers out in a healthy swell -- a sight I had never seen before in more than a decade of surfing there. Scott Bass was one of the paddlers.</p>
        <p>A chest-high set loomed, and I spun around as Mr. Keaulana had instructed. After a few deep paddles, there was a moment of weightless uncertainty as the board rose and my own propulsion was replaced by that of the wave. Suddenly I was flying down a perfect righthander. I rose and dropped along the face of the wave, gliding over the green, kelp-laden reef. A hundred yards inside, it was a simple matter to dig the paddle into the now fading wave and turn the board back out to sea.</p>
        <p>Stroking back out to the lineup, I heard Mr. Bass let out a hoot. An even larger set appeared on the horizon.</p>
        <p>GEARING UP</p>
        <p>New Challenges Require New Equipment</p>
        <p>NUMEROUS surf companies from the very big to the very small are getting into the standup paddling game. Paddles come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but the general rule is a paddle about six inches taller than yourself if you're surfing and eight inches taller if you're distance paddling. For traveling, a detachable two-piece paddle can come in handy.</p>
        <p>Two of the more complete lineups come from C4 Waterman (www.c4waterman.com) of Hawaii and Infinity Surfboards (www.infinitysurfboard.com) of Dana Point, Calif. C4's paddles cost $324.99 for a one-piece and $349.99 for a two-piece model. Infinity offers a T-grip carbon fiber model for $295, and a smaller wooden paddle for women and children for $150. Whiskeyjack Paddles (www.whiskeyjackpaddles.com) of Duluth, Minn., has also gotten into the act with its Tall Boy model for $325.</p>
        <p>C4's surfboards range from higher-performance 10-foot and 10-foot-6-inch models ($1,469.99 and $1,549.99) up to a more stable 11-foot-6-inch model ($1,649.99). C4 also offers a highly portable, remarkably stiff inflatable standup board called an ULI for $1,349.99.</p>
        <p>Infinity's Steve Boehne offers a slew of boards of all sizes in his custom hand-shaped Ku Ku Hoe line. Mr. Boehne's boards range from $1,250 for a 10-foot, 6-inch performance model to $1,500 for a 14-foot distance paddling board.</p>
        <p>Becker Surfboards (www.beckersurf.com) offers the 12-foot-1-inch, lightweight Laird Hamilton board made by Surftech for $1,660. The Laird board was originally shaped by the experienced standup paddler Ron House, whom you can contact to make a custom board directly from his Web site: (www.ronhousepaddlesurf.com).</p>
        <p>The best way to learn is to be taught. Hawaiian Surfing Adventures of Hanalei, Hawaii, offers lessons on the Hanalei River, which runs into the ocean near a terrific longboard surfing area. The cost is $45 per person for a one-hour lesson with two more hours with board and paddle (www.hawaiiansurfingadventures.com).</p>

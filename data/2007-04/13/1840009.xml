        <p>Corzine Is Seriously Hurt In Car Crash on Parkway  Gov. Jon S. Corzine was in a major car accident on the Garden State Parkway and underwent surgery last night for injuries that included a broken leg, sternum and collarbone as well as six broken ribs on each side, officials said.</p>

        <p>Shift Urged on Gonorrhea  The rates of drug-resistant gonorrhea in the United States have increased so greatly in the last five years that doctors should now treat the infection with a different class of antibiotics, the last line of defense for the sexually transmitted disease, officials said.</p>

        <p>Remembering Robinson  Mets Manager Willie Randolph, who grew up in Brooklyn idolizing Jackie Robinson, will be among the major league figures wearing Robinson's number on Sunday, the 60th anniversary of his breaking baseball's color barrier.</p>

        <p>Sallie Mae Is in Buyout Talks  Sallie Mae, the nation's largest lender to college students, is in talks to be taken private in what could be a $20 billion deal. The possible buyout poses unusual problems, because the bulk of its portfolio is federally subsidized loans.</p>
        <p>BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1</p>
        <p>University Official's 2 Roles  A vice president at Widener University, a nationally known financial aid administrator who made a business of it, is an example of how university officials have become cozy with lending companies.</p>

        <p>Dinosaur Protein Recovered  In a retrieval once thought unattainable, scientists have used advanced research techniques to recover and identify proteins in a bone of a well-preserved Tyrannosaurus rex that lived and died and was fossilized 68 million years ago.</p>

        <p>CBS Ends Imus Radio Show</p>
        <p>Off the Air After 30 Years  CBS canceled the ''Imus in the Morning'' program, effective immediately, bringing a weeklong controversy over racial and sexual insults by the radio host Don Imus to an end.</p>
        <p>MSNBC, which simulcast the show, had removed it from its morning cable lineup a day earlier. CBS's decision means that Mr. Imus, who has been broadcasting his program for more than 30 years, no longer has a home on either national radio or television.</p>
        <p>BY BILL CARTER AND JACQUES STEINBERG, PAGE C1</p>
        <p>Caught in a Wildfire  For a few days, it seemed that Don Imus might pull out of the death spiral. Once he came under fire, Mr. Imus said he was sorry for the racial insult, then began a week of penance, raising money for sick children and turning up at various other microphones to renew his apology.</p>
        <p>But even as he went through the ritual of public mortification, his backers began to see what he did not: the drumbeat was not going to stop.</p>

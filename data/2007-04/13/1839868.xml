        <p>Some opera lovers now live in fear of the impending arrival of Gerard Mortier as general director of New York City Opera because of his reputation for radical interpretations of repertory staples. The production of ''La Traviata'' revived on Wednesday night originally served as a corrective to an earlier venture of that sort: a controversial Nicholas Muni staging from 1991, in which Verdi's beloved characters were surrounded by pimps, drugs and guns, with a finale set in an AIDS ward.</p>
        <p>The current production, by Renata Scotto, replaced Mr. Muni's in 1995. It is fundamentally traditional and not so far removed from the production that holds the stage these days at the Met, save for scale and certainly cost.

The choreography by Esperanza Galan, who also serves as a featured dancer in the second act, is considerably better than most dance presented in operatic productions hereabouts.</p>

        <p>Some opera lovers now live in fear of the impending arrival of Gerard Mortier as general director of New York City Opera because of his reputation for radical interpretations of repertory staples. The production of ''La Traviata'' revived on Wednesday night originally served as a corrective to an earlier venture of that sort: a controversial Nicholas Muni staging from 1991, in which Verdi's beloved characters were surrounded by pimps, drugs and guns, with a finale set in an AIDS ward.</p>
        <p>The current production, by Renata Scotto, replaced Mr. Muni's in 1995. It is fundamentally traditional and not so far removed from the production that holds the stage these days at the Met, save for scale and certainly cost. Thierry Bosquet's costumes remain functional, his sets by turns attractive and flat. The choreography by Esperanza Galan, who also serves as a featured dancer in the second act, is considerably better than most dance presented in operatic productions hereabouts.</p>
        <p>But with so much emphasis placed on giving an audience exactly what it expects, the burden falls on the singers and players to transcend the ordinary and bring the work to life. In that regard, this ''Traviata'' fell short of its potential.</p>
        <p>There was real merit in the work of all three principal singers. The French soprano Anne-Sophie Duprels, who made her company debut as Violetta, sang with an appealingly warm, weighty tone and finely tuned technique, and moved with grace. The baritone Michael Corvino's sturdy sound and stolid bearing offered a Germont resolute in his convictions. Best of all was the tenor Bruce Sledge, whose bright, fresh voice complemented a finely shaded portrayal of Alfredo's transition from love-struck youth to repentant hothead.</p>
        <p>Still, at least on this night, there often seemed a dearth of chemistry between the performers, too little sense of the desperate passion that binds them. Supporting cast members -- in particular, Heather Johnson as Flora, Robert Mack as Gaston, William Ledbetter as the Marquis d'Obigny and Eric Jordan as Dr. Grenvil -- were more at ease and convincing. George Manahan elicited a sturdy, levelheaded account from his musicians, and the chorus performed well.</p>
        <p>There was probably more here to enjoy than to lament, and the spark may well ignite during the run. But what opening night suggested was that tradition, however valuable, can all too easily lapse into going through the motions.</p>

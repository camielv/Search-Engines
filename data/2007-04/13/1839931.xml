        <p>In a rare address to Japan's Parliament by a Chinese leader, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao pledged friendship with Japan on Thursday, but cautioned that Tokyo must match past apologies for wartime aggression with concrete actions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wen said that his three-day visit to Japan was meant to ''melt the ice'' in the relations between the countries, which have clashed in recent years over the development of natural resources, leadership in East Asia and the history of Japanese militarism in China.</p>

        <p>In a rare address to Japan's Parliament by a Chinese leader, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao pledged friendship with Japan on Thursday, but cautioned that Tokyo must match past apologies for wartime aggression with concrete actions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wen said that his three-day visit to Japan was meant to ''melt the ice'' in the relations between the countries, which have clashed in recent years over the development of natural resources, leadership in East Asia and the history of Japanese militarism in China.</p>
        <p>Japanese leaders praised Mr. Wen's address, the first by a Chinese leader to Parliament in 22 years. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan described Mr. Wen's visit as a ''big step forward.''</p>
        <p>In his speech, which was broadcast live in both nations, Mr. Wen said the economies of China and Japan were ''highly complementary and have a great potential for cooperation.'' He thanked Japan for its ''support and assistance'' in China's reform and modernization, in a nod to Japanese officials who had complained that Beijing had played down enormous amounts of Japanese aid in the last two decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wen's visit was the first in nearly seven years by a Chinese leader, and followed a fence-mending trip to Beijing last fall by Mr. Abe. China's top leaders had refused to come here because of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial to Japan's war dead, including 14 Class A criminals from World War II.</p>
        <p>Both nations appear to have made great efforts to improve ties, though no breakthroughs have been made on the most contentious issues, including the shrine visits, disputed gas and oil fields in the East China Sea and mutual suspicions about military ambitions.</p>
        <p>The Japanese government had eagerly anticipated Mr. Wen's visit, particularly since Mr. Abe's initial success in defusing tensions with China had been one of his rare achievements during his half-year in office. Mr. Abe's approval ratings have been sliding because of several scandals in his government and his perceived weak leadership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wen's hosts were likely relieved that he refrained from mentioning either the Yasukuni Shrine or Mr. Abe's recent denial of the Japanese military's coercion of women -- many of them Chinese -- into sexual slavery during World War II. He raised the history-related problems that had been at the heart of the disputes between the countries, but avoided the bitterness and finger-pointing that accompanied former President Jiang Zemin's visit here in 1998.</p>
        <p>''The Japanese government and Japanese leaders have stated many times their stance on history-related problems, publicly acknowledged their invasion and expressed their deep remorse and regret to victimized nations,'' Mr. Wen said in Parliament. ''That is something that the Chinese government and people regard positively.''</p>
        <p>But he added, ''We sincerely hope that Japan will show in concrete ways their expressed attitudes and promises.''</p>
        <p>That appeared to be a warning to Mr. Abe not to visit the Yasukuni Shrine, an impression that was reinforced when Mr. Wen said that ''only a handful of militarists'' in Japan were responsible for the war in China and that the Japanese, like the Chinese, were ''victims of the war.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wen was reiterating an interpretation of the war that Beijing adopted when it began to normalize relations with Japan in the early 1970s and believed Tokyo shared. But the Yasukuni Shrine's subsequent inclusion of the war's top leaders upended that interpretation.</p>
        <p>On Thursday morning, Mr. Wen jogged in Yoyogi Park here, surprising passers-by, and joined a group practicing tai chi. In the afternoon, he met business leaders and urged them to invest in China, Japan's top trading partner.</p>
        <p>On Friday, he is scheduled to visit Kyoto to meet business leaders and college students.</p>

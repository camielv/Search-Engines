        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Training to Be Old'' (Retirement section, April 10) did a wonderful job of highlighting what so many of us forget as we age: not only must we take care of our finances, but we must also consider our health and plan for the inevitable changes that come with aging.</p>
        <p>This proactive approach of addressing these issues now while we are healthy allows us to be more empowered in the future when we actually need these modifications.</p>
        <p>It provides us with the opportunity to plan for our future in a way that is comfortable to us and aids in avoiding that feeling of being a burden many older adults say they experience.</p>
        <p>Having hobbies that provide a sense of fulfillment, as well as having a home that accommodates our changing needs as we age, allows for a better quality of life.</p>
        <p>As a student nurse, I frequently encounter patients well into their late 70s and 80s. Often there is little structure in place to accommodate their needs, and both the patient and their families end up feeling frustrated and helpless.</p>
        <p>Incorporating life planning into retirement planning rather than simply focusing on the financial aspect is critical as our population ages.</p>

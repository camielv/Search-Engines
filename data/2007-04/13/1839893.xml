        <p>When Isiah Thomas called for his team to come together in a circle at the end of practice Thursday, the coaches and trainers outnumbered the eight players who were healthy enough to participate.</p>
        <p>With their season drawing to a close, the Knicks have been gutted by injuries -- so much that Malik Rose, a veteran forward not known for his ball-handling skills, ran plays at point guard during practice.</p>
        <p>''You have to prepare for worst-case scenarios,'' Thomas said, referring to the possibility of foul trouble or yet another injury during the Knicks' next game, Friday night against the Nets in East Rutherford, N.J.</p>
        <p>The Nets (37-40) are on the verge of clinching a playoff berth. The Knicks are on the verge of elimination. With one more Knicks loss or one victory by the Orlando Magic, the Knicks will officially be out of the race.</p>
        <p>Of the team's hobbled players, only Stephon Marbury and Renaldo Balkman have a chance of playing against the Nets. Neither practiced Thursday, but both are listed as questionable -- Marbury with a sprained toe and Balkman with what the team called a stomach virus.</p>
        <p>David Lee is back on the bench after trying to return from a right-leg injury; he is not expected to play in the remaining four games. Neither is Quentin Richardson, who recently had back surgery and attended practice Thursday wearing a sweat suit. Jamal Crawford, who has a stress fracture in his right ankle, jumped while taking practice shots but has not played since February. His next game will be next season.</p>
        <p>Despite all the ailments, the players said Thursday that they would not lie down.</p>
        <p>''We're not looking to be the No. 1 seed, of course,'' Steve Francis said, ''but we're not going to stop playing.''</p>
        <p>Already reflecting on the season, Eddy Curry said he was dissatisfied.</p>
        <p>''You can't look at this year as a success,'' he said. ''You look at it like we got a lot better from last year, but we still came short of our goals.''</p>
        <p>Thomas was not willing to do a post-mortem on the season yet. First, he must get through four more regular-season games with his depleted squad.</p>
        <p>''We are just trying to get guys in some structure where they can have some semblance of playing,'' Thomas said.</p>
        <p>Asked how Rose performed at point guard, Thomas laughed.</p>
        <p>''Terrible,'' he said. ''Get up on him and pressure him.''</p>

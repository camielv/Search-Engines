        <p>A Bronx woman was indicted yesterday on a charge of second-degree murder in connection with the death of her 2-week-old son on Dec. 31, prosecutors said. The woman, Lucila Rojas, 25, is charged with placing a blanket over the face of her son, Anthony, preventing him from breathing, then leaving him in a trash bin in Jackson Heights, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. At first she told the police that someone had taken the boy from her at gunpoint, but later confessed to investigators, Mr. Brown said. Ms. Rojas has pleaded not guilty, a spokesman for Mr. Brown said.</p>

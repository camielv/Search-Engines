      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The company that manages the Beatles' commercial interests and the EMI Group, which holds the rights to the band's recordings, said on Thursday that they had settled a dispute over royalties, renewing speculation that a deal to release the Beatles' music in digital form might be near.</p>
        <p>The Beatles are among the last big holdouts from digital music services like iTunes from Apple Inc.</p>
        <p>Expectations of a deal were raised last week when Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, traveled to London for a news conference with EMI executives. The announcement, however, was that EMI had agreed to make its catalog available on iTunes without copy protection, with Beatles' songs being excluded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jobs also added grist to the rumor mill in January, when he introduced the new iPhone. At a news conference, he demonstrated the device's abilities by displaying Beatles album covers and playing the song ''Lovely Rita.''</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Freund, a spokeswoman for Apple Corps, the company that manages the Beatles' affairs, said the settlement with EMI, first reported in British newspapers on Thursday, was not directly related to any talks about digital downloads of the Beatles' music.</p>
        <p>''Every little bit of news on this gets talked about over and over,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Still, Eric Nicoli, chief executive of EMI, has said the company hopes to be able to sell the Beatles' songs online soon. And recent legal developments, including the settlement in February of a trademark dispute between Apple Inc. and Apple Corps, appeared to clear some of the hurdles.</p>
        <p>The settlement announced on Thursday involved a lawsuit that Apple Corps filed in 2005, contending that an audit had shown that EMI was not living up to the terms of the contract under which it releases the Beatles music. Apple Corps contended that it was owed £30 million ($59 million) in royalties and other payments.</p>
        <p>Both sides declined to detail the terms of the settlement. Amanda Conroy, a spokeswoman for EMI, said only that the companies had come to a ''mutually acceptable'' agreement last month.</p>
        <p>For EMI, which has issued a series of profit warnings in recent months, the Beatles remain a bright spot more than three decades after the band broke up. ''Love,'' a compilation of remixed Beatles recordings, has been one of the company's best-selling albums over the last year.</p>
        <p>For most artists, the lure of royalties from digital sales has been enough to overcome hesitation about moving online. But the Beatles, along with acts like Led Zeppelin and Radiohead, have resisted the trend.</p>
        <p>This week, Apple Corps announced that its longtime head, Neil Aspinall, had stepped down. Mr. Aspinall, 64, will be succeeded by Jeff Jones, a former executive of the Sony BMG recording company.</p>

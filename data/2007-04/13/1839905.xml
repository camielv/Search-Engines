        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''To Close Gaps, Schools Focus on Black Boys'' (front page, April 9):</p>
        <p>The problem with segregation, even well-intentioned segregation, is that it reinforces the belief that inherited biological differences exist. It invariably reinforces racism and sexism in American public life.</p>
        <p>As a teacher of at-risk students for nearly 20 years, I would strongly encourage Ossining, N.Y., educators to consider academic solutions that focus on increasing students' reading levels as well as on teacher preparedness for working successfully with at-risk learners as opposed to relying on segregation.</p>
        <p>Children who read at or above grade level generally succeed academically regardless of race or sex. And competent teachers with a desire to work with the most disadvantaged learners are more likely to help their students achieve academic success.</p>
        <p>The power and beauty of public education in America today is that it educates all children in one classroom. Before segregating our schools, we may be well advised to look for solutions that maintain diversity in our classrooms.</p>

        <p>The New York City Council passed a bill yesterday enhancing whistle-blower laws to protect city employees who report conduct that is harmful to the health, safety or educational welfare of a child. Councilman Robert Jackson said the bill was aimed at protecting teachers from coercion to inflate test scores and those who report the failure of a school to follow through on federally mandated individual education plans for students with special needs. But some critics, including the mayor, say the bill would provide teachers facing poor performance reviews a tool to use against superiors. City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn rejected that notion yesterday, saying it would not hamper efforts to bring more accountability to schools. The Departments of Education and Investigation oppose the bill, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has signaled that he would veto it.</p>

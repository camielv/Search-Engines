        <p>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Paul Fox  Not rated; 95 minutes</p>
        <p>In cloudy, gorgeous Vancouver, a disgruntled young man named Ryan (Paulo Costanzo) is fired from his tedious white-collar job on the same day that his girlfriend (Katharine Isabelle) breaks up with him. The hero then chances into a job with the local lottery, profiling winners for its public relations magazine while courting a set dresser (Steph Song) and getting pulled into a money-laundering scheme with her ex-boyfriend (J R Bourne) that affords Ryan fancy clothes, a shiny sports car and moral qualms.</p>

        <p>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Paul Fox  Not rated; 95 minutes</p>
        <p>In cloudy, gorgeous Vancouver, a disgruntled young man named Ryan (Paulo Costanzo) is fired from his tedious white-collar job on the same day that his girlfriend (Katharine Isabelle) breaks up with him. The hero then chances into a job with the local lottery, profiling winners for its public relations magazine while courting a set dresser (Steph Song) and getting pulled into a money-laundering scheme with her ex-boyfriend (J R Bourne) that affords Ryan fancy clothes, a shiny sports car and moral qualms.</p>
        <p>Directed by the first-time feature filmmaker Paul Fox, ''Green'' was written by the novelist Douglas Coupland (''Generation X''). Much of it plays like a Don DeLillo novel by way of a sitcom, with good-looking 20-somethings fretting about consumerism and the yuppie mentality and cracking wise about existential predicaments. (Ryan says his original job required him to ''push electrons around with a stick,'' and his ex-girlfriend's gym-chiseled brother brags that he ate only 10 grams of fat last week.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Costanzo, of the sitcom ''Joey,'' is an appealing lead, with Richard Dreyfuss's edgy wit; he and Ms. Song make a sweet screen couple, although their charm is dwarfed by that of Vancouver itself, which is photographed as if it were New York in Woody Allen's ''Manhattan.''</p>

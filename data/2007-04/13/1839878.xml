        <p>SAN ANTONIO'S Fiesta Days started in 1891, as the story is told by Jorge Gonzalez, president of the city's Festival Commission, when San Antonians decided to greet President Benjamin Harrison with a peaceful spin on military history. ''Some of the ladies in town had read that in France, when someone important visited, they celebrated a famous battle,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. The women decided to commemorate the Battle of San Jacinto, the decisive 1836 engagement in Texas's struggle for independence from Mexico.</p>
        <p>They organized a parade of horse-drawn carriages and flower-festooned floats, ending with a ceremony at the Alamo, the town's most revered shrine. ''Instead of shooting each other in front of the Alamo,'' Mr. Gonzalez said, ''the participants threw flowers at each other.''</p>

        <p>SAN ANTONIO'S Fiesta Days started in 1891, as the story is told by Jorge Gonzalez, president of the city's Festival Commission, when San Antonians decided to greet President Benjamin Harrison with a peaceful spin on military history. ''Some of the ladies in town had read that in France, when someone important visited, they celebrated a famous battle,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. The women decided to commemorate the Battle of San Jacinto, the decisive 1836 engagement in Texas's struggle for independence from Mexico.</p>
        <p>They organized a parade of horse-drawn carriages and flower-festooned floats, ending with a ceremony at the Alamo, the town's most revered shrine. ''Instead of shooting each other in front of the Alamo,'' Mr. Gonzalez said, ''the participants threw flowers at each other.''</p>
        <p>Now, 116 years later, the Battle of the Flowers has evolved into a 10-day celebration that attracts 3.5 million people and includes 103 events, from a Mexican rodeo to the Oyster Bake held on the nearby St. Mary's University campus. Flowers are no longer thrown, but wreaths are laid in a ceremony at the Alamo. Multiple parades take to the streets, including the Fiesta Flambeau, which is held in the evening and brightly lighted. Marching bands adorn their instruments with battery-operated holiday lights, and Boy Scouts with propane-fueled torches help illuminate the way for 100 floats. Drill teams and military units represent the area's four active military bases.</p>
        <p>The San Antonio festival is one of the largest and oldest of the Mexican-style fiestas this spring and summer around the United States. Large or small, they are family-friendly and attract enthusiastic participants of all ages and from all backgrounds. The mood is exuberant: tejano bands set toes tapping, intrepid competitors wolf down hot peppers in jalapeño-eating contests, and young adults vie to serve as festival royalty.</p>
        <p>Usually, there is a clear tie to some religious, historical or cultural element in the community. ''These celebrations are all about reaffirming cultural integrity and drawing links to the past and the homeland,'' said Miguel Gandert, an assistant professor of journalism and communications at the University of New Mexico whose photographs have documented Mexican social rituals.</p>
        <p>In Las Cruces, N.M., La Fiesta de San Ysidro takes place at the 47-acre New Mexico Farm and Ranch Heritage Museum and honors the patron saint of farmers. ''A lot of kids don't realize that we were once an agricultural community,'' said Celina Garcia, the museum's marketing and public relations coordinator. ''They think food comes from McDonald's or the grocery store. We want them to understand the importance of this culture.''</p>
        <p>The celebration begins with a blessing of the fields and animals by Bishop Ricardo Ramírez, who also leads a procession. An all-day festival with live music and Mexican food follows. Visitors can learn to make their own tortillas or sample the traditional cornmeal drink atole.</p>
        <p>Fiesta Days in Vacaville, Calif., in May is celebrating its 50th year. The event, which runs for five days, grew from a wedding celebration between two members of the town's founding families, the Vacas and the Peñas, said its general chairman, Andy Jensen. It showcases quirky contests like Whiskerino, in which beards and mustaches are judged in the categories of longest, most unusual and best trimmed. On days featuring Mexican bands, ''thousands of white cowboy hats bounce around to the music,'' Mr. Jensen said. ''You can go and not spend a penny and listen to great music all day long.''</p>
        <p>Near the beginning of the 20th century, Mexican-Americans also took fiesta celebrations with them to the Midwest. The five-day Fiesta Mexicana in Topeka, Kan., which supports a local school, began in 1933.</p>
        <p>At Mexican Fiesta in Milwaukee, the winner of last year's jalapeño contest consumed 22 of the fiery peppers within one minute. Artisans sell their wares and run workshops on crafts like beading, and 10 priests preside over a Mass that draws about 5,000 worshipers.</p>
        <p>''Even though we're far from the border,'' said Teresa Mercado, executive director of Mexican Fiesta, ''we belong to the border.''</p>

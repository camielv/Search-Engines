        <p>This debut feature from Justin Swibel, which spends a little over an hour observing a young man silently cleaning a palatial suburban estate, is so minimalist that at times it feels as if a prank were being played on the audience.

        <p>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Justin Swibel  Not rated; 61 minutes</p>
        <p>This debut feature from Justin Swibel, which spends a little over an hour observing a young man silently cleaning a palatial suburban estate, is so minimalist that at times it feels as if a prank were being played on the audience. And yet Mr. Swibel's style is so assured, and the film's rhythms are so precise, that it would be a mistake to dismiss ''Modern Man'' as a pretentious goof.</p>
        <p>The opening section shows Eric Becker, who plays the film's unnamed and only character, cleaning a swimming pool for several minutes. The rest of the film shows our hero taking out the trash and rearranging the garbage cans, putting ceramic frogs into fun patterns, rooting around inside the house and the garage and otherwise trying to master his environment. The alternating documentary-style close-ups and monumental wide shots better suited to a Hollywood epic subtly imply that we're watching a droll parable of mankind at ease after having subdued nature, yet still not feeling in control of it.</p>
        <p>If you go to movies expecting certain familiar elements -- plot, dialogue, relationships and so forth -- you'll want to throw popcorn at the screen. But if you tune into this film's rhythms, you'll leave the theater seeing the world with fresh eyes.</p>

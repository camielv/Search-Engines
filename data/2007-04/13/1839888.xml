        <p>William R. Phillips, a former New York police officer who was a star witness for a commission investigating police corruption in the 1970s, has spent the last 32 years in prison for murdering a prostitute and her pimp.</p>
        <p>He has lost an eye to cancer and had two operations, for prostate cancer and a stroke.</p>
        <p>He lost yet another battle yesterday, as -- for the second time -- the appellate division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that he did not deserve to be granted parole, reversing a lower court ruling that was scathingly critical of the parole board.</p>
        <p>The five-judge appellate panel ruled that the release of Mr. Phillips, who is 76, would undermine respect for the law. Mr. Phillips, the court wrote in its six-page decision, had committed crimes that were a ''perversion'' of his power as a New York City police officer, and had shown ''limited remorse and insight into his criminal acts.''</p>
        <p>''As to the seriousness of the crime, we strongly disagree with petitioner's implication that the nature of his crime was no more heinous than any other murder,'' the court said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phillips, a policeman for 17 years, was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the 1968 murders of James Smith, a pimp who, the prosecutor said, was killed for failing to make a protection payment, and Sharon Stango, a prostitute who was an eyewitness. Mr. Phillips asserted that he had been framed in retaliation for exposing police corruption.</p>
        <p>It is the second time since 2003 that Mr. Phillips, who testified before the Knapp Commission, has gone through the same cycle of being denied parole, having a lower court reverse the parole board, and then having the appellate division reverse the lower court. The commission found that corruption was pervasive in the Police Department.</p>
        <p>''It's very sad, very frustrating,'' his lawyer, Daniel Perez, said yesterday. ''It's like he's stuck in an endless Ping-Pong match.''</p>
        <p>''There is something fundamentally wrong with a system in which judges keep conflicting with each other on the same case with the same person. Once you could understand, twice is bizarre.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Perez said that this time, he would appeal the case to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, and that his argument would focus on the conflict between courts.</p>
        <p>He said he was at a loss to explain that conflict. But he added: ''I know that this is a politically sensitive case. I know that Bill Phillips is not your average parole applicant.''</p>
        <p>He said he was also distressed that the appellate division had introduced what he said was a new factor into its decision, by identifying his client's ''purported lack of remorse,'' as a reason for denying parole, when the parole board itself ''said nothing about his lack of remorse.''</p>
        <p>The appellate division reversed a decision in October by Justice Marcy S. Friedman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who said that Mr. Phillips had been a model prisoner and posed no threat to society and that the parole board had, in essence, conducted its own resentencing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phillips was recruited by the Knapp Commission after it caught him taking payoffs from Xaviera Hollander, the madam who wrote the best seller ''The Happy Hooker.''</p>
        <p>He contended that he was framed on murder charges by a detective who was angry about his televised testimony before the commission.</p>

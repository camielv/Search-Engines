        <p>9:30 P.M. (IFC) HENRY ROLLINS: UNCUT FROM ISRAEL -- Mr. Rollins, left, unfurls his biting tongue in a new season of raw talk, starting with this 90-minute special that weaves a spoken-word show in Tel Aviv with film from a journey around the Holy Land. Returning to Israel for the first time in 10 years Mr. Rollins gets a personalized tour from Ziv Korren, a photojournalist, with stops at the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and the West Bank security wall, punctuated of course by Mr. Rollins's commentary on pop culture, world events and the resilience of the Israeli people. (Working with the U.S.O. he has already let loose in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Honduras, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, South Korea and Turkey.) At 11 p.m. ''The Henry Rollins Show'' moves into position with Marilyn Manson, discussing his new album, ''Eat Me, Drink Me,'' and Peaches as the musical guest. Janeane Garofalo joins the show full time with ''The Disquisition,'' a commentary segment filmed in her New York apartment.</p>
        <p>5 P.M. (Nickelodeon) SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS -- Don't take it personally; it's only business. Mr. Krabs discovers that his best friend, Plankton, is out to steal his Krabby Patty formula, leading to the biggest feud in the history of Bikini Bottom. The story is told in flashback in ''Friend or Foe?,'' a new episode to be shown at 8 p.m. as part of a five-hour, interactive marathon starring SpongeBob, right. The block also features a live-action contest in which two teams of children try to make it through a series of physical challenges without being thwarted by a ''foe'' from the other team who has infiltrated their side.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (Sci Fi) THE MYTHOLOGY OF STARGATE SG-1 -- This hourlong special dissects the myths and legends at the heart of ''Stargate SG-1,'' followed at 8 by a new episode of the series, ''The Quest, Part 2.'' ''Stargate Atlantis: The Return, Part 2'' will be shown at 9.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (BBC America) CLATTERFORD -- Come to order! The Clatterford chapter of the Women's Guild receives a visit from Lady Anne Crump, the Main Wheel of the Guild, who has the power to shut it down.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TLC) WHAT NOT TO WEAR -- Leigh, a newly single preschool teacher who just lost 30 pounds, has a wardrobe to rival her charges'. (Can we say pink polka dots?) Stacy and Clinton help her grow up.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Sci Fi) PAINKILLER JANE -- She's no cheerleader. Kristanna Loken, below, picks up the gauntlet as Jane Vasko, a tough-as-nails heroine with otherworldly self-healing powers, in this adaptation of the comic book created by Jimmy Palmiotti and Joe Quesada. She can't be killed, as she proves when she plummets from the 46th floor of a building and lives to tell the tale. But she can still feel pain, which makes her new job as a covert government agent all the more difficult. Hope she's got her medicine cabinet stocked.</p>

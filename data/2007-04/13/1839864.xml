        <p>Nominations for Man Booker International Prize</p>
        <p>Fifteen authors were named yesterday to the judges' list of contenders for the second Man Booker International Prize. The $118,655 prize, awarded every two years, recognizes a living writer for achievement in fiction published either originally in English or generally available in English. The writers on the list are Chinua Achebe of Nigeria, Margaret Atwood of Canada, John Banville of Ireland, Peter Carey of Australia, Don DeLillo of the United States, Carlos Fuentes of Mexico, Doris Lessing of Britain, Ian McEwan of Britain, Harry Mulisch of the Netherlands, Alice Munro of Canada, Michael Ondaatje of Canada, Amos Oz of Israel, Philip Roth of the United States, Salman Rushdie of Britain and Michel Tournier of France. The winner will be announced in early June.</p>
        <p>Wordsworth Goes Hip-Hop</p>
        <p>William Wordsworth has been dead since 1850, but that dude could rap. And to mark the bicentenary of the publication of his poem ''Daffodils'' (''I wander'd lonely as a cloud''), the Cumbria tourist board in England has enlisted modern technology in the form of a pop video and rap version of his poem to peddle the virtues of the Lake District, The Guardian of London reported. Oh, and let's not forget MC Nuts, the zany red squirrel, right, that delivers the rap against scenic backgrounds to convey the idea that it's hip for young people to visit the Lake District National Park this summer. ''Wordsworth's 'Daffodils' poem has remained unchanged for 200 years,'' said a spokeswoman for the tourist board. ''To keep it alive for another two centuries, we want to engage the YouTube generation who go for modern music and amusing video footage on the Web.'' The video can be seen on www.golakes.co.uk/wordsworthrap.</p>
        <p>Running the Meter</p>
        <p>In what is billed as a first, the United States and British poet laureates are to give joint poetry readings in Chicago, Washington and London. Sponsored by the Library of Congress, the Poetry Foundation and the Poetry Society of London, the readings by the laureates, Donald Hall of the United States and Andrew Motion of Britain, are to take place in Chicago on May 7, Washington on May 10 and London on June 6.</p>
        <p>Dickens Park to Open</p>
        <p>It's nearly time to take the Great Expectations boat ride, frolic in Fagan's den and sample the atmosphere of Newgate Prison. A week from today, Dickens World, above, a $115 million theme park constructed in the naval dockyards in Chatham, England, where Charles Dickens's father once worked, will open to the first of an expected 300,000 annual visitors, Reuters reported. ''If Dickens were alive today, he would probably have built the place himself,'' Ross Hutchins, the manager, said. He said the theme park, depicting a dark, dirty, dank London inhabited by thieves, murderers and ghosts, will have an air of authenticity because it was constructed in consultation with experts from the Dickens Fellowship, a worldwide association of Dickens devotees. In response to critics who speculated that the Artful Dodger, Mr. Pickwick and Uriah Heep might stroll the grounds, 35 miles from London in southeast England, Mr. Hutchins said, ''If we were Disneyfying Dickens we wouldn't be talking to people like the Dickens Fellowship to ensure the correct historical facts.''</p>
        <p>'Kaffir Boy' Banned (Again)</p>
        <p>The award-winning ''Kaffir Boy,'' Mark Mathabane's 1986 memoir about growing up poor and black during apartheid in South Africa, has been banned from an intermediate school in Burlingame, Calif., after a parent complained about two paragraphs describing men paying hungry boys for sex, The Associated Press reported. An eighth-grade teacher was ordered by Superintendent Sonny Da Marto to stop using the book in her four English classes, although it had been approved by a review committee of parents, teacher, a librarian and a member of the school board. Mr. Da Marto told the Burlingame school board that he would allow an abridged version of ''Kaffir Boy'' to be taught, but that the paragraphs depicting child prostitution were inappropriate for 13- and 14-year-olds. The school board refused to reverse his decision. The American Library Association included ''Kaffir Boy'' on its list of ''Outstanding Books for the College Bound.'' The child rape scene also gave the memoir the No. 31 spot on the association's list of the 100 most frequently banned or challenged books.</p>

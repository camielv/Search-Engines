        <p>The City Council passed a bill yesterday extending death benefits to family members of sanitation and correction workers killed in the line of duty. The bill is expected to be signed by the mayor and would go into effect immediately with a retroactive date of September 2005. Sanitation Department officials say that that date would cover claims by the survivors of two sanitation workers and a supervisor who have died since 2005, two from heart attacks and one in a work accident. Survivors of firefighters and police officers killed in the line of duty already receive health care coverage. But the city must now act on a case-by-case basis to provide those same benefits to survivors of sanitation and correction workers, a process that could take months.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is appalling that John McCain would claim that it is Democrats ''who deny our soldiers the means to prevent an American defeat'' (''McCain Says Democrats Play 'Small Politics' Over Iraq,'' news article, April 12).</p>
        <p>The responsibility for four years of failure to provide enough troops to secure Iraq, to adequately equip and train troops on the ground, and to pursue all diplomatic avenues available to win lies squarely with the Bush administration and the Congress when it was controlled by the Republicans. It is they who mismanaged this war of choice for so long.</p>
        <p>Rebekah Frederick  Chicago, April 12, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>John McCain, in his support for an open-ended military commitment in Iraq, argues that ''America has a vital interest in preventing the emergence of Iraq as a Wild West for terrorists, similar to Afghanistan before 9/11.''</p>
        <p>His position makes clear that Iraq was not a Wild West for terrorists before 9/11. What happened to create this risk between 9/11 and the present? The answer is the Bush administration's invasion and its aftermath.</p>
        <p>Senator McCain's campaign to lead us into the future will lack credibility until he acknowledges the truth about the past, including his failure to ask the right questions at the right time. This, of course, would require courage more profound than most of our presidential hopefuls have so far demonstrated.</p>
        <p>William Kenney  Whitestone, Queens, April 12, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Four Years Later in Iraq'' (editorial, April 12):</p>
        <p>After recounting the grim situation in Iraq, you conclude, ''There is no possible triumph in Iraq and very little hope left.''</p>
        <p>But President Bush and Republicans have a huge political hope: to run out the clock on the war until the end of Mr. Bush's term -- no matter what the cost in additional lives and suffering -- in order to avoid politically disastrous blame for the inevitable defeat.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush really cared about our troops, their families and the welfare of Iraqis, he would not persist in this cynical folly.</p>

        <p>The January issue of Vanity Fair included an article by Christopher Hitchens, ''Why Women Aren't Funny,'' that explored a supposed humor gap between the sexes and in so doing raised the ire of plenty of writers, bloggers and, not surprisingly, funny women. New Yorkers need only head to the West End Theater to find a compelling counterpoint to Mr. Hitchens's essay. There nine red-nosed members of Kendall Cornell's Soon-to-Be-World-Famous Women's Clown Troupe, above, are presenting ''Not Just for Shock Value: A Femmes-Clowns Assemblage.'' The show, presented by Six Figures Theater Company, includes an hour's worth of sketches, dances and satirical scenarios performed by a cast of seriously silly madcaps who have trained under Ms. Cornell. Some vignettes toy with stereotypical male-female roles -- a wife in one scene (Ishah Janssen-Faith) aims to please by baking a pie for her gruff husband (Judi Lewis Ockler) -- only to twist them around and allow the role playing to descend into slapstick madness. Other sketches are darker and are reminders that the greatest clowns try to make people laugh to help stave off existential horrors: in one Ms. Janssen-Faith grapples with an imagined Pandora's box and discovers, as if new, a litany of disastrous events that have befallen humanity. Ms. Cornell, the group's founder and director, is a former dancer and sometime actor who studied under the big-time clowns David Shiner and Philippe Gaulier after first discovering clowning by accident. ''It was like a frying pan on the head,'' she said. ''It just called me.'' To Ms. Cornell men aren't the only ones who can be funny. ''Women can be funny if you let them, and if you look at them differently,'' she said. Ultimately the proof is in the laughter of course. (Through April 28, West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, Manhattan, 212-868-4444, smarttix.com; $20).</p>

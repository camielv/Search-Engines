        <p>Offering the first hint of a timetable for a return to democracy, Fakhruddin Ahmed, left, the head of the army-backed caretaker government, promised parliamentary elections before the end of 2008. ''I would like to state here categorically that we shall not stay in office a single day more than is necessary,'' he said in a televised broadcast. In January, after months of clashes between the country's two main political parties, the government declared emergency rule and a Jan. 22 general election was canceled. Political activity has since been barred and members of both parties have been arrested on charges of graft.</p>

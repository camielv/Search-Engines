        <p>This group show, organized by Debra Singer and Matthew Lyons of the Kitchen, is a textbook example of how political content operates in new art: in a slanting, unmonumental, coding-within-coding way that dodges ideology and trades earnestness for agile, deadpan wit.</p>

        <p>The Kitchen  512 West 19th Street, Chelsea  Through April 28</p>
        <p>This group show, organized by Debra Singer and Matthew Lyons of the Kitchen, is a textbook example of how political content operates in new art: in a slanting, unmonumental, coding-within-coding way that dodges ideology and trades earnestness for agile, deadpan wit.</p>
        <p>References to past alternative cultures are frequent, but rarely nostalgic. Josephine Meckseper's video ''Rest in Peace'' intercuts images of recent antiwar protests with an orgy scene from a 1960s hippie-lifestyle film, with shots of what appears to be a college discussion group attended by bored and fidgety students. Everthing feels retro. Heroism is over.</p>
        <p>So is the vision thing. Corey McCorkle spreads 19th-century broadsides, produced by the utopian Oneida Colony, on the gallery floor. They look as if they should go under a kitty litter box. Meredyth Sparks cut-and-pastes pictures of the Bader-Meinhof gang. Carol Bove revisits a druggy moment when Beat and Hippie merged. From Scott Hug we get Warholian mug shots of low-grade celebrities (Paris Hilton, Mike Tyson), from Bozidar Brazda a souvenir of ''The Unknown Ones,'' a punchy East German punk band that will probably stay unknown.</p>
        <p>A tie-dye sunburst mandala by Michael Phelan is also a Color Field painting, a target and an American flag. Two neat but busy installations by Fia Backstrom are like consumerist processors, shmushing together corporate logos, out-of-date manifestos, designer tableware, art by other artists -- namely Roe Ethridge and Kelley Walker -- and Play-Doh imitations of their art.</p>
        <p>In this context of scrambled values Adam Helms's drawings of heads in black ski masks are mere terrorist chic, Gardar Eide Einarsson's ''Liberty or Death'' flag a snazzy bath towel. High up in a corner hangs a text piece by Dave McKenzie: ''Tomorrow Will Be Better.'' If artists can just keep savaging history, kicking forms and fracturing received ideas, it might least might not be worse.</p>

        <p>After weeks of internal squabbling, state workers approved a four-year contract on Thursday that will give them a 13 percent overall pay increase but will also require that they pay part of their health insurance premiums for the first time. The new contract affects about 43,000 state workers affiliated with the Communications Workers of America and will take effect on July 1. Workers will contribute an extra half of 1 percent of their salary to the state's troubled pension fund, and the retirement age for new employees will be raised to 60 from 55. The contract ratification is a political victory for Gov. Jon S. Corzine, who has been outspoken about his desire to control spiraling pension and health care costs.</p>

        <p>Tainted pet food is still on the market almost a month after a recall began, Food and Drug Administration officials said Thursday at a Senate hearing.</p>
        <p>''We know that there's not 100 percent of the product off the shelf,'' Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof, director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the agency, said in testimony before a Senate appropriations subcommittee.</p>

        <p>Tainted pet food is still on the market almost a month after a recall began, Food and Drug Administration officials said Thursday at a Senate hearing.</p>
        <p>''We know that there's not 100 percent of the product off the shelf,'' Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof, director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine at the agency, said in testimony before a Senate appropriations subcommittee.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sundlof also said that the agency was continuing to track down small batches of the tainted wheat gluten from China that might have gotten into the food.</p>
        <p>The F.D.A. began its investigation March 16, after Menu Foods announced a recall of 60 million cans of cat food and dog food. The recall has been expanded to nearly 100 brands covering products made from last Dec. 3 to March 6.</p>
        <p>The agency says 16 animals have died from eating tainted food, but others believe the number is far larger.</p>
        <p>State veterinary medical associations are reporting their own higher numbers. Glenn Kolb, the executive director of the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association, said in an interview that as of Thursday morning Oregon had 114 suspected cases, with 44 resulting in death: 20 dogs and 24 cats.</p>
        <p>Banfield Pet Hospital, which has 615 veterinary centers in the United States, has shared data with the F.D.A. of a 30 percent increase in kidney failure in cats since the tainted food went on the market. Banfield hospitals have treated 1,600 pets believed to have eaten food containing wheat gluten contaminated with melamine, a rich nitrogen used to make plastics and as fertilizer.</p>
        <p>Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, linked the pet food problem to the broader issue of monitoring the safety of the nation's food supply, saying, ''It's the same broken food safety system.''</p>
        <p>''The F.D.A. needs to standardize a set of processes, practices and inspection systems to make sure our pets are protected,'' Mr. Durbin added.</p>
        <p>The agency inspects pet food manufacturing plants on an ''at risk basis,'' Dr. Sundlof said, adding that it had inspected 661 plants since 2004.</p>
        <p>Mr. Durbin said that meant that fewer than one-third of pet food facilities in the United States had been inspected once in the last three and half years.</p>
        <p>Pet food makers now operate under regulations set by state laws as well as standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials, an international group whose members include commercial feed makers and state officials.</p>
        <p>Duane Ekedahl, president of the Pet Food Institute, a trade association for the industry, testified that the industry was heavily regulated by the F.D.A. and state authorities and that pet foods were perhaps the most highly regulated product in supermarkets.</p>
        <p>The institute on Thursday announced the creation of a National Pet Food Commission to investigate the cause of the contamination and recommend action.</p>
        <p>Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, said the F.D.A. needed to do a better job communicating to consumers through its Web site, and Dr. Sundlof agreed.</p>

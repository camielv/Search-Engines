        <p>WHO -- Dr. Walton Reeves, 50, a physician from Atlanta, left, with a friend, Tom Maybank, 34  WHAT -- 1-bedroom house  WHERE -- Sylva, N.C.</p>
        <p>I've been a fisherman for 25 years and everyone in my immediate family owns waders. I even proposed to my wife in the middle of a trout stream in north Georgia. I own a home site here in the Balsam Mountain Preserve community, where my long-term plan is to build a retirement home. Until then I have a fractional share of a cabin that entitles me to eight weeks of use a year, which is about all my family can manage time-wise.</p>

        <p>WHO -- Dr. Walton Reeves, 50, a physician from Atlanta, left, with a friend, Tom Maybank, 34  WHAT -- 1-bedroom house  WHERE -- Sylva, N.C.</p>
        <p>I've been a fisherman for 25 years and everyone in my immediate family owns waders. I even proposed to my wife in the middle of a trout stream in north Georgia. I own a home site here in the Balsam Mountain Preserve community, where my long-term plan is to build a retirement home. Until then I have a fractional share of a cabin that entitles me to eight weeks of use a year, which is about all my family can manage time-wise.</p>
        <p>I think fly-fishing is like riding a bike: it's easy to pick up again. But in many ways it is also like golf. It takes a lot of work to be a really good fly-fisherman. Throughout this development there are creeks where you can catch 8- or 12-inch southern brook trout. But there is also access to some of the bigger rivers, and bigger fish, in western North Carolina, like the Tuckaseigee, which is less than 10 miles away, and the Nantahala River, less than an hour away, where I can go on float trips with my son. As the hatches start in late spring and through the summer all the trout fisherman come out. Though you can catch and keep the fish, I'm not one to do that unless I'm planning on eating it.</p>
        <p>Of course, it's not all about fishing. There are a lot of old timber roads that have been converted to hiking trails, the golf course is halfway completed and an equestrian center should be open later this year. I'd imagine a lot of owners will bring their horses up here to escape the heat of the summer with them. I'll certainly be escaping the heat of Atlanta, where it's easily 15 to 20 degrees warmer.</p>

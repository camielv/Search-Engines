        <p>Paintings  Peter Freeman Inc.  560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo  Through May 12</p>
        <p>I'm not sure how this exhibition of 16 small paintings by James Ensor (1860-1949) landed in a SoHo gallery, but here it is, and it's a treat, a full-color follow-up to the survey of his works on paper at the Drawing Center in 2001.</p>
        <p>Most of the pictures are from the 1880s, with a few leaps to later dates. Ensor was born and spent most of his life in Ostend, Belgium, a seaside resort where his family ran a souvenir gift shop. He left for only two years to study art in Brussels. But in that time he forged links with avant-garde circles, with which he maintained contact from his attic studio back home.</p>
        <p>The show's earliest paintings, among them a couple of still lifes, indicate that Ensor was fully up to speed on Symbolist and Neo-Impressionist developments. He was also exploring religious subjects. And he could paint like a dream. His 1880 ''Judas Throwing the Silver into the Temple'' is at once shadow-pooled and refulgent, Rembrandt with the lights turned up.</p>
        <p>In the late '80s something happened. Maybe he hit a depression or, as was the case with his contemporaries Munch and van Gogh, isolation loosened him up. His palette whitened; his hand grew more draftsmanly. He fixed on strange, fresh themes: skeletons, human grotesques, the carnival masks in his family shop.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the work is clearly satirical, as in ''The Baths at Ostende'' (1890), with its fat prelates, scrawny lovers and randy gents packed to the horizon. The paintings of masks are more mysterious. The masks themselves are comically malevolent enough to scare away angels and demons alike. Ensor further animates them by attaching them to figures in tableaus that recall Bosch, Goya, Daumier and Watteau. In one of the show's latest paintings, a Crucifixion scene from 1938, masks and figures fuse, and both blend with the hellish atmosphere. Carnival is a crazed Lenten drama; comedy and tragedy are one.</p>
        <p>Young artists have been looking at Ensor. Dana Schutz, who has a solo show at Zach Feuer in Chelsea, riffed memorably on his ''Entry of Christ Into Brussels in 1889'' a few years ago. But even the most interesting contemporary painting feels studied and controlled, while the most interesting Ensor feels totally mad, even if he himself was quite sane.</p>
        <p>Asked in a survey what his greatest misery was, he answered, probably in an antic tone, ''the horror of an exhibition.'' He didn't have many. Even so, the Belgian government acknowledged his career by making him a baronet. It should have made him king: king of attics, king of masks, king of the great gift shop of a world he surveys. Long does he reign.</p>

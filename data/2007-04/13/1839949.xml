        <p>Nothing else in ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters'' -- certainly not the labored title, which sounds like would-be ''Borat'' -- is as funny as the first five minutes. Let me qualify that: not much that I have seen in movies recently made me laugh as hard as the opening bit, in which a parade of singing cartoon movie snacks is disrupted by a caterwauling death-metal rendition of familiar pre-film warnings: don't talk or use your cellphone or otherwise disrupt the motion picture experience.</p>

        <p>Opens today nationwide.  Directed by Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis  87 minutes</p>
        <p>Nothing else in ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters'' -- certainly not the labored title, which sounds like would-be ''Borat'' -- is as funny as the first five minutes. Let me qualify that: not much that I have seen in movies recently made me laugh as hard as the opening bit, in which a parade of singing cartoon movie snacks is disrupted by a caterwauling death-metal rendition of familiar pre-film warnings: don't talk or use your cellphone or otherwise disrupt the motion picture experience.</p>
        <p>And try to stay awake. Adapted from the popular show on the ''Adult Swim'' programming block on the Cartoon Network and directed by that show's creators, Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis, the ''Aqua Teen'' movie is strictly for cultists, and even they might find less than 90 bongless minutes hard to sit through. The animation is deliberately flat and crude; the action consists mainly of characters hovering or moving slowly against simple backgrounds; and the humor tends to be fuzzy rather than sharp.</p>
        <p>The main characters are Meatwad, Master Shake and Frylock, anthropomorphic food products of varying degrees of intelligence who argue with one another and try to solve assorted problems.</p>
        <p>The point is not ''South Park''-style topical satire -- though ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' did make the news a while back when the Boston police mistook a promotional campaign for a terror threat -- but rather endless riffing on pop culture minutiae. The writers seem to proceed from the adolescent assumption that anything that crosses their minds is automatically funny. To them, sure. There is something like a plot, involving time travel and an exercise machine, and enough swearing to justify an R rating and a theatrical release.</p>
        <p>''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for obscenity and crude sexual humor.</p>

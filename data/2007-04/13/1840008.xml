        <p>Eleven federal jail guards, including a captain and three lieutenants, were charged yesterday with beating two inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, one so badly, officials said, that a pool of his blood and bits of his hair lay on the floor of his cell when it was over.</p>
        <p>The guards were also charged with covering up the beatings by filing false reports that blamed the inmates for having instigated the attacks. Eight of them pleaded not guilty yesterday at arraignments in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and were released on bail.

        <p>Eleven federal jail guards, including a captain and three lieutenants, were charged yesterday with beating two inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, one so badly, officials said, that a pool of his blood and bits of his hair lay on the floor of his cell when it was over.</p>
        <p>The guards were also charged with covering up the beatings by filing false reports that blamed the inmates for having instigated the attacks. Eight of them pleaded not guilty yesterday at arraignments in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and were released on bail. The three others are expected to be arraigned in federal court within days.</p>
        <p>The attacks do not appear to be directly connected and occurred almost four years apart, court papers showed, the first in November 2002, the second a year ago.</p>
        <p>Three of the jail guards charged yesterday, Capt. Salvatore LoPresti, Lt. Elizabeth Torres and Officer Scott Rosebery, are also accused of abuse in a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Muslim inmates who claim they were mistreated at the federal detention center after they were arrested in roundups following the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>
        <p>The first assault in yesterday's indictment took place on Nov. 13, 2002, court papers said, when Captain LoPresti was making rounds of the jail's high-security special housing unit and ordered an inmate to remove a T-shirt he had wrapped around his head.</p>
        <p>When the inmate refused, Captain LoPresti felt ''disrespected'' and returned with other guards to kick and punch the man so fiercely that ''a pool of blood and clumps of the inmate's dreadlocks'' were left on the floor, the court documents said.</p>
        <p>To cover up the beating, prosecutors said, Captain LoPresti and at least two others, Lt. Kelly Tassio and Officer Rosebery, took a sheet from the inmate's bed and draped it from the window bars to make it seem as if the inmate had tried to hang himself. Two more guards, Officer Alfred Santana and Officer Steven Peterson, joined them in later submitting false reports claiming the inmate became enraged when they stopped him from committing suicide, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>Last June, during an investigation into the attacks, Lieutenant Tassio told federal agents that she had indeed written a false report on Captain LoPresti's orders, prosecutors said. Five days later, however, she recanted, the government said, and insisted the report was accurate.</p>
        <p>The second attack occurred on April 11, 2006, court papers said, when a fight broke out between an unnamed jail guard and a second inmate, who, like the first, was identified by prosecutors only as John Doe. Officer Rosebery stopped the fight, court papers said, then beat the inmate in his cell as Lieutenant Torres looked on, taunting from the hallway.</p>
        <p>The guards then hauled the inmate to an elevator, the papers said, to take him to the special housing unit. In the elevator, they tripped the inmate and one guard, Officer Glen Cummings, ''repeatedly stomped'' him as he lay on the floor, court papers said, and Lieutenant Torres stood lookout in the hallway while the elevator door was open.</p>
        <p>The beating in the elevator was caught by a surveillance camera, officials said. In this instance, the guards filed false reports claiming the inmate became ''combative'' on the way to the special housing unit, court papers said.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Detention Center, near Gowanus Bay in Sunset Park, has housed some of Brooklyn's most violent and troublesome federal inmates, from Bonanno family gangsters to Islamic terrorists.</p>
        <p>But in recent years, it has come under scrutiny for its treatment of inmates, particularly those swept up after 9/11 as part of terror investigations.</p>
        <p>In April 2002, the Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit legal and educational group, filed a lawsuit, Turkmen v. Ashcroft, charging that at least five Arab and South Asian inmates at the jail had been subjected to abuse, including being kept in solitary confinement with the lights on 24 hours a day. Captain LoPresti, Lieutenant Torres and Officer Rosebery are defendants in the suit, as well as in a companion suit called El Magrabi v. Ashcroft.</p>
        <p>In 2003, the inspector general for the United States Department of Justice issued two reports describing a pattern of mistreatment of detainees, and cited evidence that included videotapes of officers shoving unresisting, shackled detainees into walls and mocking them during body cavity searches. Turkmen v. Ashcroft accuses Officer Rosebery of repeatedly stepping on an inmate's shackle chains in the elevator, and Lieutenant Torres is accused of forcing another to strip in front of her. While the suit does not accuse Captain LoPresti -- one of the highest-ranking officers at the jail -- of any specific act, it says he allowed an atmosphere of abuse to exist. The suit is now before the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''These names aren't new to us,'' said Rachel Meeropol, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights. ''We are pleased that officials are finally being held accountable for a pattern of systematic physical and verbal abuse at the M.D.C.''</p>
        <p>Captain LoPresti's lawyer, Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, declined to comment on the charges yesterday. The captain was also charged in the indictment with writing official letters to help guards at the jail obtain weapons for use off duty, in violation of federal Bureau of Prisons regulations.</p>
        <p>The other guards charged in the indictment are Lt. Frank Maldonado and Officers Jaques Lamour, Jamie Toro and Angel Perez.</p>

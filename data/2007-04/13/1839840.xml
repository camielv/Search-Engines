        <p>Several thousand pipers and drummers in kilts will march up Avenue of the Americas tomorrow for the ninth annual Tartan Day Parade. A celebration of Scottish culture, the parade is the culmination of Tartan Week in New York. Full pipe bands as well as individual pipers and drummers from around the country and the world, including New Zealand, Canada and Pakistan, will fill the streets of Manhattan with the high-pitched wail of their native instruments. Organizations like the Caledonian Club of New York and the American Scottish Foundation will also march. ''It's a real celebration of Scotland and America,'' said Michael Kellet, first secretary for Scottish affairs at the British Embassy in Washington, ''it should be a real occasion.'' Specific plaid tartans are associated with different Scottish clans or families, and hundreds of clans will be displaying their colors. ''I'll be at the parade, and I'll have my kilt,'' Mr. Kellet said. Albannach, a Glasgow band making its parade debut, will perform at St. Andrews Pub (120 West 44th Street, Manhattan) before the procession. A post-parade party at Stout will feature the music of Albannach, Scocha and MacTalla Mor. (Tomorrow, Avenue of the Americas, between 45th and 58th Streets, 2 p.m.; Stout, 133 West 33rd Street, 4 p.m., $25 in advance, $40 at the door; tartanweekny.com.)</p>

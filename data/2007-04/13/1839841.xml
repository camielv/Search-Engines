        <p>BINDLESTIFF CIRKUS'S CAVALCADE OF YOUTH (Sunday) If you've ever wondered what those daring young men (or women) on the flying trapeze did before adulthood and professional success, see this show, whose spirited circus performers are all under 21. At 3 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 598-0400, ovationtix.com/trs/pe/67061; $10; $5 for under 18.</p>
        <p>CHILDREN'S CARNIVAL (Tomorrow and Sunday) No one will be sitting under the apple trees at the Queens County Farm Museum this weekend; instead the orchard will be the site of games, hayrides and carnival attractions. (Also April 21 and 22.) From 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., 73-50 Little Neck Parkway, Floral Park, (718) 347-3276; $8.</p>
        <p>'EVERYTHING ABOUT SCHOOL (ALMOST)' (Tonight through Sunday) This nostalgic musical, revived by Tada!, the youth theater troupe, humorously underscores what most of us realized sometime between classes: that the bossy, self-dramatizing second grader usually turns into a bossy, self-dramatizing teenager, and that the boy who mercilessly teases a girl in seventh grade is likely to be swooning at her feet a few years later. (Through May 13.) Tonight at 7 and tomorrow and Sunday at 2 and 4 p.m., Tada! Theater, 15 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 252-1619, Ext. 28; $18; $8 for 15 and under. (For tomorrow's shows only, buy one ticket and receive one free.)</p>
        <p>'GO, DIEGO, GO LIVE!: THE GREAT JAGUAR RESCUE' (Today through Sunday) Diego, cousin of the 7-year-old title character of Nickelodeon's preschool show ''Dora the Explorer,'' joins her onstage in an adventure in which they seek to retrieve Baby Jaguar's growl from those mischievous monkeys, the Bobos. Today at 11 a.m.; tomorrow at 11 a.m. and 2 and 5 p.m.; Sunday at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. At Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $29 to $79.</p>
        <p>'MISS NELSON HAS A FIELD DAY' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Miss Nelson, that sweet teacher, and Viola Swamp, the stern substitute who sometimes suspiciously resembles her, are back in another musical based on the books by Harry Allard and James Marshall. (Through May 20.) At noon, Manhattan Children's Theater, 52 White Street, near Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; $15.</p>
        <p>'THE NUMBER 14' (Tonight through Sunday) The title represents a bus, but not one from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. This Number 14 is driven by the Axis Theater Company of Canada, which has stopped at the New Victory Theater with a show of mime, masks and physical comedy. Mask-making is offered in the lower lobby one-half hour before curtain. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at noon and 5 p.m. At 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, newvictory.org; $12.50, $25 and $35.</p>
        <p>'OPENING DOORS: A JOURNEY IN MUSICAL THEATER' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Take the songs of Stephen Sondheim, Cy Coleman and other modern composers and combine them with the talents of selected New York City middle and high school students, and you have this cabaret show, presented by Wingspan Arts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 7 p.m., the Hypothetical Theater, the 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, wingspanarts.org; suggested donation, $10. Reservations: RSVP@wingspanarts.org.</p>
        <p>OPERA TRIPLE BILL (Sunday) In ''Happy Feet'' Mumbles the penguin is ostracized because he can't sing; in ''Happy Tweet!'' Stumbles the penguin is ostracized because he can -- opera, that is. How Stumbles persuades his pop-loving peers to share his tastes is just one of three brief operatic stories to be presented by the Manhattan School of Music in its annual performance celebrating its school outreach program. At 2:30 p.m., Greenfield Hall, 122nd Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428. Free, first come first served.</p>
        <p>PARENTING MAGAZINE FILM FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) A day of free -- yes, you read it right -- family movies, with perks like games and magic for children and chair massages for parents. The lineup is ''The Breakup'' (9 a.m.), ''Over the Hedge'' (11:10 a.m.), ''Shark Tale'' (12:55 p.m.) and ''Charlotte's Web'' (2:55 p.m.) At Clearview Cinemas, 1871 Broadway, at 62nd Street, parentingextras.com (the link is ''You're Invited''). Telephone R.S.V.P.'s: (212) 522-4551.</p>
        <p>'SPRING SPROUTS' (Sunday) It sprouts, of course, from seeds, the focus of this drop-in program at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Children will learn all about seeds, taste the edible kind and find out which they can plant easily at home. From 2 to 4 p.m., the Discovery Garden, 1000 Washington Avenue, Crown Heights, (718) 623-7200, bbg.org. Free with admission: $5; $3 for 65+ and students; free for under 16 and members.</p>
        <p>'TRIP THE LIGHT FANTASTIC' (Tomorrow) These lights will be truly fantastic: they are in the creations of Nam June Paik, James Turrell and Spencer Finch, artists whose work will be explored in ARTime's latest ''Saturday in the Galleries'' program for children 5 to 10. Each month a 90-minute art tour is followed by discussion and sketching. At 11 a.m. Reservations (required) and meeting place: (718) 797-1573 or ARTimeNY@nyc.rr.com; $25 for one child and adult; each additional child, $5.</p>
        <p>JIM WEST (Tomorrow and Sunday) Classic puppetry combines with classical music in two shows from Theatreworks/USA. Jim West, a master of large-scale puppets, will present ''Aesop's Fables'' tomorrow and ''Dinosaurs!'' on Sunday. At 10:30 a.m., the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; $25.</p>

        <p>LeWITT--Sol. It is with deep sadness, that we heard of the death of our friend. We are privileged to have known him and to own his work. Deepest sympathy to his family, friends, and to Susanna Singer and Jo Watanabe. DJ and Robert J. Dodds III</p>
        <p>$(6$)LeWITT--Sol. Sol and the group of like-minded friends founded Printed Matter in 1976. His generosity towards other artists and a wide range of radical art practices is revealed in that simple act. His own books run through his life's work like a thread, perpetually drawing us back towards his essential ideas. We remember Sol for his gentle penetrating humanity, his support of artists, friends, and art situations, his simple love of giving. The Staff and Board of Printed Matter, Inc.</p>

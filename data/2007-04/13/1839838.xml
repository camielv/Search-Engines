        <p>Tony Jaa fans, be warned: there's no kick boxing in this three-day, four-feature minifestival at the Museum of the Moving Image. Instead the main attractions are new films from two of the small crop of Thai directors who have broken into the American art-house circuit in recent years. ''The Unseeable'' (at 8 tonight) is a haunted-house movie, set in 1930s Bangkok, about a pregnant woman who comes to the city to find her baby's father and finds a compound full of ghosts (including the little girl above). It was directed by Wisit Sasanatieng, whose wild cowboy melodrama from 2000, ''Tears of the Black Tiger,'' finally opened here this year. His reference point in ''The Unseeable'' is Japanese horror rather than westerns and martial arts films, and both the plot and the color palette are more restrained than in ''Tears,'' but the aesthetic is similar: less attention is paid to chills and thrills than to the ways in which golden light reflects off the faces of beautiful, frightened women. Pen-ek Ratanaruang's ''Invisible Waves'' (8 p.m. tomorrow) is a companion piece to -- if not a remake of -- his last film, the 2003 ''Last Life in the Universe.'' Once again Tadanobu Asano, the hardest-working man in Asian movies, plays a Japanese slacker with criminal ties, cast adrift in Thailand. (Just to make the connection between the two films more complete his character, now named Kyoji instead of Kenji, again becomes involved with a woman named Noi, though this time she's played by a Korean actress rather than a Thai one.) Where Mr. Sasanatieng is movie-geek over the top, Mr. Ratanaruang is pan-Asian hipster minimalist: a Thai Jim Jarmusch, complete with long, slow takes and melancholy visual jokes. Fans of Haruki Murakami's fiction are likely to appreciate Mr. Ratanaruang's slightly chilly vibe; in ''Invisible Waves'' Kyoji fends off an amorous woman by saying he needs to get back to the sauce simmering on the stove, which could be an homage to Mr. Murakami's spaghetti-cooking heroes. (Tonight through Sunday night, Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us.)</p>

        <p>An obituary in some copies yesterday about the writer Kurt Vonnegut misidentified the novel in which a recurring Vonnegut character, Kilgore Trout, was introduced. It is ''God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine,'' not ''Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children's Crusade.'' The surname of another character, who appears in the novel ''Breakfast of Champions, or Goodbye Blue Monday,'' was misspelled. It is Philboyd Studge, not Sludge. (The obituary is reprinted today on Page A16.)</p>

        <p>You may leave ''Apostasy,'' Gino Dilorio's brave drama at Urban Stages, questioning some of the playwright's choices, but you'll also leave knowing you have just seen two exceptional examples of naturalistic acting by the women in the cast.</p>
        <p>They are Susan Greenhill and Susan Louise O'Connor, playing mother and daughter and deftly embodying all the contradictory emotions that relationship should entail: love, mutual dependence, resentment. Ms. Greenhill is the mother, Sheila, who is dying of cancer. Her adult daughter, Rachel, despite some unresolved tensions from childhood, is trying to play caregiver and cheerleader. Among other things, she supplies Mom with marijuana in the hope that smoking it will make her hungry (a cause the audience will fully support; Ms. Greenhill could not be more fragile-looking).</p>

        <p>You may leave ''Apostasy,'' Gino Dilorio's brave drama at Urban Stages, questioning some of the playwright's choices, but you'll also leave knowing you have just seen two exceptional examples of naturalistic acting by the women in the cast.</p>
        <p>They are Susan Greenhill and Susan Louise O'Connor, playing mother and daughter and deftly embodying all the contradictory emotions that relationship should entail: love, mutual dependence, resentment. Ms. Greenhill is the mother, Sheila, who is dying of cancer. Her adult daughter, Rachel, despite some unresolved tensions from childhood, is trying to play caregiver and cheerleader. Among other things, she supplies Mom with marijuana in the hope that smoking it will make her hungry (a cause the audience will fully support; Ms. Greenhill could not be more fragile-looking).</p>
        <p>This is a white Jewish family, but Sheila has news for her daughter: Lately she has been watching a black televangelist, Dr. Julius Strong (Harold Surratt), and is thinking of converting to Christianity and its vision of what happens after death. ''I feel as though I'm at the edge of something, and I'm not at all ready to jump,'' she explains. ''I need help.''</p>
        <p>We first meet Dr. Strong as a video projection (by William Cusick, part of a dandy set by Roman Tatarowicz), but he soon shows up at Sheila's hospice, drawn by the letters she has written him. Beware of any man of the cloth who immediately says, ''Call me Julius'': Sheila has financial resources, and Dr. Strong's church has debts. Where there's money, can sex be far behind?</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dilorio's fearless play, first staged last year at the New Jersey Repertory Company in Long Branch, is more than a soap opera. He weaves in compelling exchanges on issues of faith. Julius's unorthodox explanation of how he views his job is especially delicious.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dilorio throws some abortion politics into the mix in a way that feels gimmicky; this ultimately is a play that's not as realistic as the acting that delivers it. But that acting is something to see, particularly a devastating scene in Act 2 when Rachel walks in on her mother and the minister and finds them feasting on Chinese food. Ms. O'Connor's look as she takes in this tableau, the interloper usurping her role as nourisher, is a wonderful mix of heartbreak and fury.</p>
        <p>''Apostasy'' continues through May 6 at Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan; (212) 868-4444.</p>

        <p>9 P.M. (Hallmark) LOVE'S UNENDING LEGACY (2007). This fifth installment in the ''Love Comes Softly'' series, based on the novels by Janette Oke, finds Missie LaHaye (Erin Cottrell, above), now a frontier widow, and her son returning home to her parents two years after the murder of her sheriff husband. Altruistic to the end, she adopts an orphaned teenager, who then implores Missie to rescue her 7-year-old brother. Two men, a pastor and a sheriff, are willing to help, and to woo. But Missie's grief may prevent her from finding true happiness.</p>
        <p>5 P.M. (E!) THS INVESTIGATES SPRING BREAK NIGHTMARES -- It's not always fun in the sun. This special looks at the many ways college vacations can head south.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Nickelodeon) KISS AND TELL NIGHT -- A bunch of Nickelodeon teenagers lock lips for the very first time in this two-hour block of premiere episodes of ''Ned's Declassified,'' ''The Naked Brothers Band'' and ''Drake &amp; Josh.'' Nat and Alex Wolf, Devon Werkheiser, Miranda Cosgrove and Lil' JJ philosophize about puckering up on the screen, while Jesse McCartney and Katharine McPhee reminisce about their real-life first kisses. J. Boogie is host.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Oxygen) THE HOUSESITTER (2007). Tori Spelling and her new husband, Dean McDermott, right, do double duty for Oxygen this month. They star in this crime drama about a woman caring for the villa of an eccentric man who falls in love with a seemingly innocuous plumber; turns out he's the owner's psycho brother. And Ms. Spelling and Mr. McDermott can also be seen each Tuesday at 9 p.m. in ''Tori and Dean: Inn Love,'' a reality series about their foray into the bed-and-breakfast industry.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Sci Fi) KAW -- The tag line: ''A gathering of ravens is called an 'unkindness,' but a small farm town will call this one murder.''</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (BBC America) BRITPOP: LIVE FOREVER -- In mid-1990s Britain, Oasis captured the country's swinging mood in its debut alum, ''Definitely Maybe'' -- and jump-started, with Pulp and Blur, the homegrown music scene known as Britpop. This special travels with the bands to the top of the charts.</p>
        <p>11 P.M. (Fox) MAD TV -- Tom Bergeron of ''Dancing With the Stars'' shows off some fancy footwork in the evening's skits.</p>
        <p>11:30 P.M. (Comedy Central) LOUIS C. K. -- Mr. C. K. (short for Szekely, which he pronounces SEE-kay -- get it?) doesn't hold back in this, his latest stand-up special. On his mind: naming children, his hatred of hide-and-seek, his thoughts on being married, why he finds his daughter the most annoying person in his life, and trying to get rich -- the better to pay for his daughter's therapy sessions later on, maybe.</p>
        <p>MIDNIGHT (Fox) TALKSHOW WITH SPIKE FERESTEN -- Alex Borstein from ''Family Guy'' sits in the hot seat.</p>

        <p>At 17, Charles Simonyi slipped out of Soviet-controlled Hungary to seek freedom. At 33, he slipped away from the safety of a large corporation, Xerox, in search of fortune at a young start-up named Microsoft.</p>
        <p>And today, at 58, that fortune is allowing him to slip the surly bonds of Earth, at least for a couple of weeks, to visit the International Space Station.</p>
        <p>Dr. Simonyi is the fifth so-called space tourist -- a phrase those who buy the flights dislike -- and by a large margin the wealthiest. A software pioneer who led the teams that gave the world Microsoft Word and Excel, he has amassed a personal fortune of about a billion dollars, according to Forbes Magazine.</p>
        <p>That kind of wealth has bought him two jets -- which he pilots himself -- and a 233-foot-yacht, along with other expensive toys. In comparison to an average American family's worth, the estimated $20 million he paid to blast off in a Soyuz spacecraft is the equivalent to something like a visit to an amusement park or a weekend getaway.</p>
        <p>''A trip to outer space is actually, for someone like Charles, a logical step,'' Martha Stewart said in an e-mail message from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, where she has gone to see her friend launched into space and to film the event for her television program. Ms. Stewart called Dr. Simonyi ''intrepid, inquisitive, curious and actually very bold,'' adding that his adventure had created a wish to take a trip of her own.</p>
        <p>Those with less means than Ms. Stewart to buy a ticket can follow Dr. Simonyi's trip on his Web site, CharlesinSpace.com, which details the months of preparation for the flight, including gaining zero-gravity experience aboard an airplane, survival training, working in a spacesuit and practicing helicopter rescues.</p>
        <p>He follows four other space tourists -- Dennis Tito, Mark Shuttleworth, Gregory Olsen and Anousheh Ansari -- whose trips were arranged by Space Adventures Ltd., a company in Vienna, Va.</p>
        <p>In an interview from Russia, Dr. Simonyi said he would spend his time in space photographing Earth and taking part in experiments. Many involve things like blood tests, he said, so ''I'm more the experimental subject than the experimenter.''</p>
        <p>He has prepared for the possibility of the nausea many space voyagers encounter with Russian conditioning methods that include riding in a spinning chair and sleeping with his legs elevated above his head. ''It's one of those don't try-it-at-home things,'' he said, explaining that it left his head feeling bloated and heavy. ''It's the feeling that you're going to get a headache, but you don't.''</p>
        <p>Like any good guest, he will take a gift: takeout. Ms. Stewart selected the menu, and Alain Ducasse, the French chef, prepared it for April 12, Cosmonauts Day in Russia. The meal includes quail roasted in Madiran wine, duck breast confit with capers and semolina cake with dried apricots.</p>
        <p>Dr. Simonyi will fly up with Fyodor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov, both Russian cosmonauts, and return with Mikhail Tyurin, a cosmonaut, and Capt. Michael E. Lopez-Alegria of the Navy, who are finishing their six-month mission.</p>
        <p>The trip caps a lifelong interest in space and technology for Dr. Simonyi. At 13, he won a contest to be Hungary's ''junior astronaut'' and met a cosmonaut in Moscow. As a student, he punched holes in paper tape to program the Soviet Ural-2 computer. Wanting to read English-language accounts of the United States' space program, he said, was ''one of my motivations in learning English.''</p>
        <p>His interest stayed strong; in his first year at Microsoft, he persuaded another space enthusiast, Paul G. Allen, to fly to Florida for the first space shuttle launching. Mr. Allen, now one of the world's richest men, has pursued his own interest in space by paying for the development of SpaceShipOne, the small craft that won the Ansari X Prize in 2004.</p>
        <p>Dr. Simonyi said that he admired those who were trying to bring about a new space industry, but that when it came to space: ''I am not an entrepreneur. I'm a customer.'' (His company, Intentional Software, is creating a product to simplify the process of writing computer programs.)</p>
        <p>Another tech-millionaire-turned-space-entrepreneur, Elon Musk, said that being a private astronaut ''does not do much to advance the greater cause of space exploration,'' which he said was best furthered by companies like his, SpaceX, which has won a NASA contract to ferry astronauts to the space station after the space shuttle program shuts down in 2010.</p>
        <p>For Dr. Simonyi's part, he said he was just happy to be finally on his way. He said he fully understood the risks of space travel, like the station's being hit by orbital space debris, but added that in relative terms, ''the actual risk is very small.'' Besides, he said, ''if you ask whether I'd like to be in a head-on collision on the freeway or be hit by orbital debris, it's the latter.''</p>
        <p>And, to tie his past to his present adventure, he is taking a paper tape from the Ural-2 with him to orbit.</p>

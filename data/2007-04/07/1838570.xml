        <p>As the New York International Auto Show opened, Detroit's automakers hoped visitors would be entranced by new products and overlook weak March sales.</p>
        <p>All three companies lost market share last month as they cut back on low-margin deliveries to rental-car companies and failed to increase sales at their dealerships. Toyota, on the other hand, had its best month ever and said it had sold half a million hybrid cars.</p>
        <p>Ford executives told reporters that their restructuring plan is on track and introduced a boxy crossover vehicle, the Flex, that they think will help move sales in the right direction. General Motors introduced three minicars and asked consumers to vote for the one they want to see built, while the Chrysler Group showed off its redesigned Jeep Liberty sport utility vehicle.</p>
        <p>The Detroit automakers still account for a large portion of the auto show floor and a majority of overall sales in the United States, but they are perilously close to being overtaken by foreign-based competitors.</p>
        <p>Each one finished the first three months of 2007 with lower sales than a year ago, suggesting that there could be more disappointment when the automakers report first-quarter earnings.</p>

        <p>ON YouTube, copyrighted video clips of movies and TV shows are far less popular compared with noncopyrighted material than previously thought, according to a new study.</p>
        <p>On their face, the results could have serious implications for YouTube's owner, Google, and the media companies, most notably Viacom, with which it has been negotiating. But not everyone agrees.</p>
        <p>Vidmeter, which tracks the online video business, determined that the clips that were removed for copyright violations -- most of them copyrighted by big media companies -- comprise just 9 percent of all videos on the site. Even more surprising, the videos that have been removed make up just 6 percent of the total views (vidmeter.com).</p>
        <p>Google is in negotiations with big media companies in hopes of reaching agreements that would allow YouTube to feature clips of movies and television shows. Viacom, owner of MTV Networks, is suing Google over the showing of copyrighted material like clips from ''The Daily Show'' and ''South Park'' on the site.</p>
        <p>''This finding,'' writes Henry Blodget on his Internet Outsider blog, ''is the opposite of consensus, which assumes that Big Media videos account for a small percentage of total videos, but a large percentage of views.'' It means, he adds, that Google has ''a lot more leverage in the YouTube-Big Media negotiations than was commonly thought'' (internetoutsider.com).</p>
        <p>But the consensus might not have been so far off after all, writes Adario Strange on the Epicenter blog at Wired News (blog.wired.com/business). The study is flawed because it examined only those videos that YouTube removed after receiving a complaint from a copyright holder, he writes. It ''fails to take into account the vast number of copyrighted videos that slip under the radar daily, existing on YouTube sometimes for months before any removal request is made.''</p>
        <p>How large that number is, however, remains unknown. Far from this giving Google a leg up in its negotiating power, Mr. Strange says just the opposite may occur. ''None of this will slow the Viacom lawsuit,'' he writes. ''In fact, the report's finding may even bolster the company's claims. Vidmeter found that Viacom was the leader in terms of pirated content on YouTube.''</p>
        <p>KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL -- Christine Bockelman of SmartMoney.com offers a list of ''10 Things Your Restaurant Won't Tell You'' (available in a more user-friendly format at finance.yahoo.com). One of them is ''eating here could make you sick,'' Ms. Bockelman writes, citing a recent study that determined that 58 percent of restaurant workers in New York City report to work when ill.</p>
        <p>Restaurants will also never tell you, ''never go out to eat on a Monday,'' she writes. Because of the way deliveries are scheduled, ''any food not used over the weekend is at least three to four days old.''</p>
        <p>PRODUCTIVITY TIPS -- Also from the News You Can Use file, List Division: The National Business Research Institute's blog offers five factors that affect employee productivity. No. 1 is a no-brainer: ''Attitude is everything,'' so ''happy employees are productive employees'' (nbrii.com/blog)</p>
        <p>No. 2 tells us that bad bosses are often the biggest barriers to maintaining a productive staff.</p>
        <p>But the N.B.R.I. apparently disagrees slightly with a consultant who told the blog, ''A poor supervisor is definitely the No. 1 factor that causes low productivity.''</p>
        <p>MORTGAGING THE FUTURE -- A 102-year-old pensioner in East Sussex in England was recently granted a 25-year mortgage, according to the Times Online. The unidentified mortgage holder, who will rent his property out, ''joins a growing army of retired people hoping to cash in on buy-to-let schemes,'' according to the newspaper's Web site (business.timesonline.co.uk).</p>
        <p>Most lenders in Britain usually limit mortgages to those under age 75, but some banks have loosened their restrictions lately, leading to ''a rush of applications from older investors.''</p>
        <p>''Obviously,'' one lender said, ''there is an element of risk if property prices and rental income suddenly fall but there is no sign of that at the moment.''</p>

        <p>CBS breezed to an easy victory on Thursday night as ''CSI,'' now in its seventh season, garnered the night's highest ratings and 21.5 million total viewers at 9 p.m., according to Nielsen's estimates. A repeat of ABC's ''Grey's Anatomy'' in that hour drew 8.4 million viewers. CBS's ''Shark'' at 10 earned 15.3 million viewers, a new record and considerably better than the No. 2 show in the time slot, ABC's ''October Road'' (7.7 million). Fox and ABC shared second place for the night. ABC posted a slight edge in total viewers, while Fox fared better among adults 18 to 49. The Fox quiz show ''Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?'' (10.2 million) finished second at 8 behind CBS's ''Survivor: Fiji'' (13.3 million). NBC was fourth over all with a lineup of 40-minute ''supersized'' episodes of ''The Office'' at 8 (6.7 million), ''30 Rock'' at 8:40 (5.2 million) and ''Scrubs'' at 9:20 (5 million).</p>

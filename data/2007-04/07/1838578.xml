        <p>A federal appeals court ruled that United States courts did not have the authority to prohibit allied military forces in Iraq from transferring to Iraqi government custody an American who has been sentenced to death. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the prisoner, Mohammed Munaf, 53, did not have recourse to American courts because he had been convicted by a court of a sovereign nation. Mr. Munaf, an Iraqi who became an American citizen in 2000, was convicted for his role in the kidnapping of three Romanian journalists in Baghdad. Mr. Munaf, who was sentenced to death by hanging by an Iraqi judge, has said his trial was flawed and his confession coerced. Jonathan Hafetz, a New York lawyer representing Mr. Munaf, said an appeal would be sought.</p>

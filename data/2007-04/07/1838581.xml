        <p>Introduced on Wednesday: 2008 Audi S5</p>
        <p>Is it real? Very much so.</p>
        <p>What's the point? The $50,000-$60,000 V-8 luxury Eurocoupe class has few players, so Audi saw room for another entry with an A4-derived coupe.</p>
        <p>What they said: "The A5 is the most beautiful car I have ever designed," said Walter de'Silva, head of Volkswagen Group Design. (Audi introduced the S5 and V-6 powered A5 at the Geneva auto show in March.)</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: "We're sick of potential customers heading off to the Mercedes dealership for a CLK simply because Audi didn't offer any alternative."</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? The S5 shares the mechanicals of the S4 sedan, so it packs a 4.2-liter 354-horsepower V-8, all-wheel-drive and a 6-speed manual transmission.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? Audi hasn't announced prices, but you can expect the S5 to land between the S4 and S6 -- which is to say, probably starting in the mid-$50,000 range. Deliveries begin in June.</p>
        <p>How's it look? Over all, we concur with Mr. de'Silva's self-congratulations: this is a great-looking car. In its stance and proportions, the S5 is reminiscent of its upscale corporate cousin, the Bentley Continental GT -- a stylish and luxurious personal transport, rather than a sports car. The S5 has Audi's signature high cowl and raked side glass (as demonstrated most emphatically on the TT), but its roofline is upright enough to accommodate rear-seat passengers taller than Elijah Wood.</p>

        <p>Ingesting 44 songs by Hugo Wolf in a single gulp at Weill Recital Hall on Thursday night was an experience somewhere between generosity embraced and a marathon negotiated. The Austrian Cultural Forum, branching out from its tiny performance space in Midtown, divided the considerable burden of Wolf's ''Spanisches Liederbuch'' among three singers. And the performers onstage indeed seemed fresher after two and a half hours than the good-size audience, which had made it through two intermissions before beginning to dwindle.</p>
        <p>Wolf's harmonic imagination and way with words lightened the load for listeners. The ''Spanisches Liederbuch'' sets poems, mostly anonymous, from a Spanish collection in German translation. The pains and absurdities of romantic love are a frequent topic, but Wolfgang Holzmair, a baritone; Susanna Philips, a soprano; and Hermine Haselböck, a mezzo-soprano, have also separated the 10 ''spiritual'' (Geistliche) songs and placed them in the middle of a three-part program. Many items are short; many have their humor captured in music through Wolf's willingness to follow words and phrases beyond the regularity of bar lines.</p>

        <p>Ingesting 44 songs by Hugo Wolf in a single gulp at Weill Recital Hall on Thursday night was an experience somewhere between generosity embraced and a marathon negotiated. The Austrian Cultural Forum, branching out from its tiny performance space in Midtown, divided the considerable burden of Wolf's ''Spanisches Liederbuch'' among three singers. And the performers onstage indeed seemed fresher after two and a half hours than the good-size audience, which had made it through two intermissions before beginning to dwindle.</p>
        <p>Wolf's harmonic imagination and way with words lightened the load for listeners. The ''Spanisches Liederbuch'' sets poems, mostly anonymous, from a Spanish collection in German translation. The pains and absurdities of romantic love are a frequent topic, but Wolfgang Holzmair, a baritone; Susanna Philips, a soprano; and Hermine Haselböck, a mezzo-soprano, have also separated the 10 ''spiritual'' (Geistliche) songs and placed them in the middle of a three-part program. Many items are short; many have their humor captured in music through Wolf's willingness to follow words and phrases beyond the regularity of bar lines.</p>
        <p>Wolf's unusual harmony in ''Alle gingen, Herz, zur Ruh'' leaves Schubert and Schumann behind and knocks on the door of the 20th century. Vocal lines often begin on pitches that defy their piano introductions but soon make perfect sense. Piano parts -- managed here with great security and style by Russell Ryan -- like to play against the song, not alongside it, and can be very elaborate. Wolf, an Austrian who lived in the second half of the 19th century, grew up a rebel and a hothead, alternating between hero worship (Wagner) and juvenile delinquency (written death threats to schoolmates). Despite later success, he drifted into madness and died at 42.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holzmair has a lovely voice and ear and sells these songs, fervent syllable by fervent syllable. Ms. Philips's soprano is big, bright and penetrating, and with age will certainly round itself into something mellower. She is a scrupulous musician, though not very good at reducing her opera-house voice to the conversational levels needed for a space like this. Ms. Haselböck, like everyone else, was musically cultured and terribly intense. I did find her writhing stage presence a trial.</p>

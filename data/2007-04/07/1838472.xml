        <p>Editorial contends that there is at least one point on which supporters and critics of Nancy Pelosi's visit to Syria can agree: it is the White House, not speaker of House, that should be taking diplomatic lead; asserts that Bush administration has far more appetite for scoring political points than figuring out whether talking to Syria might help contain bloodletting in Iraq or revive efforts to negotiate Middle East peace</p>

        <p>There is at least one point on which we and the critics of Nancy Pelosi's visit to Damascus can agree: It is the White House, not the speaker of the House, that should be taking the diplomatic lead. But the Bush administration has far more appetite for scoring political points than figuring out whether talking to Syria might help contain the bloodletting in Iraq or revive efforts to negotiate peace.</p>
        <p>So long as Mr. Bush continues to shun high-level discussions with this troublesome but strategically located neighbor of Israel, Lebanon and Iraq, such Congressional visits can serve the useful purpose of spurring a much needed examination of the administration's failed policies.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pelosi and the five Democrats and one Republican who accompanied her are scarcely the first to raise such questions during the three years that Mr. Bush has instructed his top envoys -- and reportedly Israel as well -- to avoid negotiations with Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad. Plenty of other Republicans and Democrats have been taking similar trips and offering similar advice. They were ignored, but spared the White House's ridicule.</p>
        <p>In the administration's perverse view, the only legitimate time for negotiations would be after the most contentious and difficult issues -- Syria's support for Hamas and Hezbollah, its meddling in Lebanon and open border with Iraq -- have already been resolved. Thus, what ought to be the main agenda points for diplomatic discussions have been turned into a set of preconditions designed to ensure that no discussions ever take place. As the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, Congressional representatives of both parties, this page, and many others have pointed out, Washington should be eager to raise just those issues, along with the possibility of a land-for-peace deal with Israel, directly with Syrian leaders.</p>
        <p>By initiating such talks, the administration would give itself a chance of driving a wedge between Syria and Iran. That could strengthen Washington's efforts to restrain Iran's growing influence over Iraq. Further isolating Iran might also persuade Tehran that the price of its nuclear ambitions is too high.</p>
        <p>Israel also has more to gain from talking directly with Syria. If it wanted to, Damascus could curb arms supplies to Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and agree to a just peace on the Golan frontier. And if Syria chose not to take these necessary steps, it would get the blame it deserved. Right now, Syria is getting a free ride by offering unconditional talks which it knows that Israel, in deference to the Bush administration, must refuse.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pelosi did not help matters by claiming in Damascus that Israel was ready to talk -- an assertion that Israeli officials were quick to deny. Her job is to spur the Bush administration to pursue active diplomacy, not to attempt to conduct that diplomacy herself. The more she hews to the careful path, the more useful her efforts will be.</p>

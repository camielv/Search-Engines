        <p>The Tracinda Corporation, the investment arm of Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor, bid $4.5 billion in cash for the Chrysler Group, 12 years to the month after an earlier attempt by Mr. Kerkorian to buy the company, which was acquired eventually by Daimler-Benz of Germany.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerkorian joins three other bidders for Chrysler.</p>
        <p>Ten months ago Mr. Kerkorian, then the largest individual shareholder in General Motors, tried to unite G.M. with Renault of France and Nissan of Japan in a global alliance. But discussions ended in October without an agreement. Mr. Kerkorian sold his G.M. shares.</p>
        <p>Tracinda said it expected the process to take no more than 60 days and asked for an exclusive right to negotiate with DaimlerChrysler during that period. Tracinda said its offer was contingent on reaching a new agreement with the United Automobile Workers.</p>

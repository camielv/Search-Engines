        <p>After failing to line up new financing, New Century Financial became the largest mortgage company to file for bankruptcy protection since the market for loans to people with weak, or subprime, credit collapsed this year.</p>
        <p>In the next 45 days, the company plans to auction its three principal assets: its mortgage lending business, its servicing platform and its loan portfolio. It is unclear, however, how much the company will make from the sales since many other lenders are also up for sale.</p>
        <p>Shareholders are expected to be wiped out in the bankruptcy case and many creditors could also lose significant sums. Auctions of loans seized by the company's banks before the bankruptcy filing will provide an important estimate of how much the assets are worth.</p>

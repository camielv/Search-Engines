        <p>Introduced on Thursday: 2008 Subaru Impreza WRX</p>
        <p>Is it real? It's the real thing -- the next WRX will come in four-door and five-door body styles. Subaru has officially shunned the word hatchback, as it is trying to move the WRX beyond the tuner world. Uh, good luck with that.</p>
        <p>What's the point? Simple -- it's due for a change. Another factor: the next coming of the Mitsubishi Evolution is on the horizon.</p>
        <p>What they said: "With this car, we have incorporated comfort and maximized room inside," said Akihide Takeuchi, program general manger of the Impreza WRX. "We have made it nice-looking and added fuel economy. So the car is more balanced."</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: No matter how much Subaru wants to balance out the raw performance of the WRX with comfort, there's no getting around the fact that the WRX five-door will be the foundation of its next W.R.C. rally car, which means that performance always wins out.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? The good ol' 2.5-liter boxer engine has been tweaked with a new turbocharger and a new intercooler. It still puts out 224 horsepower, but the new combination should cure the WRX's notorious turbo lag. The WRX is built on a new platform with a wheelbase that's nearly four inches longer than the outgoing model.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? You can expect the prices to carry over when it goes on sale this summer: about $24,000 for the WRX (and $17,000 or so for the base Impreza).</p>
        <p>How's it look? With this revamp, the WRX moves a bit more mainstream. The huge hood scoop is still there, but the lines are simpler. No funny bugeye lamps or cubic fender flares. Honestly, the four-door kind of looks like a Kia Rio while the five-door has a bit of a Daewoo Lanos in it. The interior redesign is a major improvement.</p>

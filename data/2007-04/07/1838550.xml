        <p>City Island in the Bronx may finally be free of the police firing range located across Eastchester Bay.</p>
      </block>
      <block class="full_text">
        <p>At the door of his waterfront home on City Island in the Bronx yesterday, Ken Binder said one word when he learned that the police firing range, just across Eastchester Bay, was slated to close.</p>
        <p>''Soon?'' he asked eagerly.</p>
        <p>Well, not exactly. The range is moving to a police compound in the College Point section of Queens that will not be built for several years.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Binder, a retired interior designer, was ready to begin celebrating the range's demise.</p>
        <p>''I would get down on my hands and knees and kiss the feet of whoever would take it away,'' he said, his words punctuated by a volley of deep pops echoing from across the water.</p>
        <p>Since 1959, the New York Police Department has used the peninsula in Pelham Bay Park known as Rodman's Neck for all manner of ballistic and ordnance-related exercises -- target practice, training maneuvers, blowing up of unwanted explosives.</p>
        <p>And for just about as long, the residents of City Island, a sort of seafarer's Mayberry largely isolated from the annoyances of big-city life, have cursed the daylong barrage of booms and rat-a-tats. (Except for the detonation of confiscated fireworks around the Fourth of July. ''That's kind of fun,'' Mr. Binder said.)</p>
        <p>Despite the construction of muffling sheds and sound barriers, the report has continued largely without interruption -- thock, thock, thock-thock, thock.</p>
        <p>But on Thursday, the city announced plans for a 30-acre high-technology campus on the site of a city auto pound in Queens to house the Police Academy, the firing range and other training grounds scattered across the city.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the news exploded across City Island.</p>
        <p>''This is wonderful,'' said Jeanne Pezone, a lifelong resident who was helping out at Boy Scout Troop 211's plant sale in front of Trinity United Methodist Church at Bay Street and City Island Avenue. Ms. Pezone, 57, said that in recent years, the familiar racket had taken on a poignant new meaning.</p>
        <p>''My mother has Alzheimer's,'' she explained, ''and she forgets about the shooting, and every time she hears it, she goes, 'Listen, what's that noise?' And I say, 'Yes, Mom, it's the range.' ''</p>
        <p>The troop's scoutmaster commissioner, Edward Esposito, said it was not just the noise pollution that would not be missed.</p>
        <p>''A lot of my Boy Scouts swim in the water, and there's a lot of lead from the bullets that's leaked into the soil and the water,'' he said. ''I don't want it to spoil our waters and our fish.''</p>
        <p>Some residents refused to believe that the range would close.</p>
        <p>''I'll never see it,'' said Robert Gilbert, out for a walk with his yellow Labrador retriever, Suzie. ''I'm 65, and I'll be dead before it happens. They may say they'll close it, but they say a lot of things.''</p>
        <p>At the cavernous restaurant called Seafood City, John Weis, a retired police officer, peered out the patio window at the expanse of brown trees and old buildings that make up the firing range across the bay. ''It's been here for so many years,'' he said, somewhat wistfully. ''It ain't going to leave anytime soon.''</p>
        <p>And, perhaps predictably, there were those who wished the range would remain, for a variety of reasons.</p>
        <p>''For business, it's bad,'' said the woman at the cash register of the City Island Diner, who would not give her name. ''We'll miss them. The cops are good guys, and they come from all over the place.'' As for the noise, she said: ''It's like living next to the subway. You get used to it.''</p>
        <p>Up the street at JGL Wines and Liquors, the news seemed to disturb the very order of things.</p>
        <p>''Holy mackerel!'' said the proprietor, who would not give his name.</p>
        <p>His friend Yolanda Cirulli, who had fixed him a lunch of penne aglio e olio, did not know what to think. First Ms. Cirulli, a member of the City Island Civic Association, declared victory, recalling her years of battling the noise. But then she thought of the cats and dogs who live on the firing range and whom she cares for.</p>
        <p>''There are at least 25 cats there,'' she said, ''and those policemen, they love the cats. They treat them very well. What's going to happen to them?''</p>
        <p>JGL's proprietor added: ''Let me tell you another bad thing. When there's trouble here, the cops are here, instantly. And tons of guys. Last year a guy crashed his motorcycle on the corner. In five minutes, there must have been 50 cops.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cirulli decided that the closing was a good thing. ''Oh my God, it finally happened,'' she said. ''I can't believe it. You see, you have to persevere.''</p>
        <p>She just wanted to make sure that, for the cats' sake, it did not happen too soon.</p>
        <p>''This will take a little time, won't it?''</p>

        <p>Introduced on Thursday: Callaway C16 Cabrio</p>
        <p>Is it real? This superswift convertible, based on the Corvette C6, is available in minute quantities, manufactured in California. Or Connecticut. Or Germany.</p>
        <p>What's the point? To provide an alternative for people who feel a 505-horsepower Corvette Z06 is just too darned slow.</p>
        <p>What they said: "There's a niche that believes that too much is never enough," said Mike Vendetto, Callaway spokesman. "We hope to fit that piece of the puzzle."</p>
        <p>What they didn't say: Who exactly is paying $128,765 or tens of thousands more with optional equipment for what is essentially a rebodied Corvette with lots more power.</p>
        <p>What makes it tick? There's no doubt the Callaway is a world-class scorcher, running from 0 to 60 miles an hour in 3.3 seconds, covering the quarter-mile in 10.9 seconds. (That's for the highest-powered version.) A supercharged, 6.0-liter 'Vette V-8 delivers either 560 or an optional 616 horsepower.</p>
        <p>How much, how soon? Order one today the company says it's sold five already and you'll wait roughly 10 to 12 weeks for delivery.</p>
        <p>How's it look? Like the Corvette's sophisticated European cousin, especially the Ferrari-like snout and eggcrate grille. Spendthrift buyers may as well drop another 23 grand for the special German leather interior, available in virtually any color.</p>

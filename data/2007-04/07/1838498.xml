        <p>I RECKONED that inviting three fellow Texans to a tequila tasting might prove to be a risky proposition when I heard the jackhammers. It was a late winter evening, and I was shivering on the curb in front of Dos Caminos restaurant in Midtown Manhattan. The jackhammers were ripping up the sidewalk to make way for new rows of outdoor tables. My brain was already throbbing from the racket, and I hadn't even taken my first shot.</p>
        <p>I ducked into the velvet-draped entrance of Dos Caminos with my contact lenses stinging from the exhaust of a passing bus. My official purpose was to conduct an executive pursuit of the world's finest agave-based adult beverages. Only later would it dawn on me that I was actually on a metaphysical mission of utmost import.</p>
        <p>I slipped down a staircase to the restaurant's cavelike lower floor. As best I can recall, it looked like a cross between a tropical resort and a border town brothel: windowless rusty pink walls, a six-stool bar, scores of dining tables, pastel banquettes with gossamer curtains. But my recollections may be flawed. Sometimes being stone cold sober can be the most blinding condition of all.</p>
        <p>As I settled into a banquette to wait for my Texan drinking buddies, I perused the notes I had taken earlier in the week during a tequila tasting conducted by Eben Klemm, the beverage director for B. R. Guest Restaurants, which owns the Dos Caminos chain. I suggested to him that tequila was unlike any other alcohol, that it was really a drug with semihallucinogenic properties.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen any scientific evidence of that,'' Mr. Klemm informed me. Then he added, with a knowing grin, ''But it does seem to be a different kind of drunk.''</p>
        <p>Tequila boasts a uniquely exotic provenance that must be certified by the Mexican government's Tequila Regulatory Council. Just as authentic Champagne can come only from the eponymous region in France, authentic tequila must hail from the area around the town of Tequila, in the state of Jalisco. Likewise, it must be made from the blue agave plant. Premium tequilas are 100 percent blue agave. Blended tequilas, known as mixtos, must contain at least 51 percent blue agave with the balance coming from sugar cane or maize.</p>
        <p>Although tequila originated as a peasant drink, it often commands prices higher than those of many Scotches and vodkas, with certain specialty brands ranging from $40 a bottle up to $2,000 a bottle. According to Mr. Klemm, high tequila prices result from its lengthy, labor-intensive production process. Agave plants need at least six to eight years to mature. The pineapple-shaped hearts of the agave, called piñas, must be harvested by hand -- machine-powered combines are too imprecise -- and then cooked, crushed and fermented into liquid that is 35 percent to 55 percent alcohol, or 70 to 110 proof.</p>
        <p>If you spy a ''worm'' in the bottle, that's mezcal. Imbibe at your own risk. Mezcal can be made from any of 10 agave species baked in rock-lined pits. As I can testify on the basis of unfortunate experience, it smells like burnt hair, bites like a rabid dog and kicks like a mule on methamphetamines. Mr. Klemm said the famous ''worm'' found in mescal bottles was a grub originally intended to certify potency. ''If the liquid is less than 35 percent alcohol, the grub will rot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Describing tequila as ''a much cleaner spirit'' than mezcal, Mr. Klemm said there were more than 60 tequila producers in Mexico who distilled and marketed an estimated 400 different labels each year. Dos Caminos claims the largest selection of tequila in New York City, with 120 labels.</p>
        <p>Most tequilas fall into three traditional categories: blanco, reposado and añejo. Blanco is a white tequila aged in oak barrels for less than two months. Reposado, or ''rested,'' tequila is also white but it is aged from two months to a year. Añejo, or ''aged,'' tequila is aged in oak for more than one year but less than three years; it is usually much darker in color than blancos or reposados.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Mexican government roiled the tequila market by approving a fourth category known as extra añejo aimed at attracting upscale consumers. To qualify as extra añejo, the tequila must be aged in oak barrels for at least three years. Extra añejo tequilas come out of the barrels with a golden color, a buttery taste and a smoky aroma reminiscent of a fine Cognac. Therein lies the problem for self-proclaimed purists like Mr. Klemm who prefer a more herbal distillation.</p>
        <p>''The oak calms down the tequila,'' he said. ''If it is aged too long, the oak overpowers the taste, and the characteristics that make it agave get lost.''</p>
        <p>I felt like getting lost when my fellow Texans arrived at Dos Caminos looking for trouble and insisting on anonymity. As with the beverages we were about to sample, they represented three distinct drinking categories. The lone woman, who called herself Blank Out, was a Dallas sales representative with a relatively pale thirst. Rip-Toasted was a well-lubricated San Antonio lawyer with a peppery twang. Anjerquo, an Austin-based investment banker, had a sallow complexion made rosy by his predilection for Scotch.</p>
        <p>As the wizened extra añejo in the posse, I was expected to lead (and pay for) the tasting while duly recording their preferences. I began by ordering the same Partida Blanco ($12 a shot) and Partida Reposado ($14 a shot) I'd sampled with Mr. Klemm. He had described the blanco as ''very herbal-like agave with notes of lime, cilantro and clay.'' By contrast, he had deemed the reposado ''less fiery and more peppery, with a hint of vanilla from the oak.''</p>
        <p>My buddies Rip-Toasted and Anjerquo downed their shots of blanco and reposado, puckered their lips and frowned with unspoken opprobrium. Blank Out told me that the two tequilas conjured ambivalent memories. ''The first one tastes like college,'' she said. ''The second one is smoother. It tastes like being out of college.''</p>
        <p>Our next flight of tequila consisted of a Partida Añejo ($16 a shot) and an El Tesoro Paradiso, an extra añejo ($18 a shot). Mr. Klemm had characterized the añejo as ''mapley and without spiciness.'' He confessed that the extra añejo was ''just a bit too oaky and Cognacy'' for his palate.</p>
        <p>My fellow Texans took spirited exception on both counts. The always perky Senorita Blank Out commended the añejo as tasting ''breezy, like a good vacation in a hammock.'' My increasingly jerky amigo Rip-Toasted and my ever quirky patron Anjerquo preferred the extra añejo that Mr. Klemm had politely disdained. ''I detect a note of caramel in the extra añejo,'' Rip-Toasted reported.</p>
        <p>Anjerquo allowed, ''It tastes like Cognac except that it doesn't burn my mouth as bad.''</p>
        <p>Gradually and then all of a sudden, in much the same manner that the gin-guzzling F. Scott Fitzgerald described the process of going bankrupt, I realized that a tequila tasting was something of an oxymoron. I saw no further point in torching my tongue or in mincing words simply for the sake of posing as a connoisseur. Agave-based beverages weren't meant to be savored like fine wines. They were meant to induce what my drinking buddies and I referred to as a Tex-Mex state of mind.</p>
        <p>''If you ask me, the whole lot tastes like rocket fuel,'' I declared to the obvious delight and agreement of my compadres. The four of us chugged another round of extra añejos, and then another, and I called for the check.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, we bolted up to the sidewalk in front of Dos Caminos. The jackhammers were gone, and a springlike mist was falling all around us. I didn't feel the slightest bit woozy or weak-kneed. I was bright-eyed and blissfully borderline, pricklier than a cactus patch. As we piled into a cab bound for another cantina, I kicked up my cowboy boot heels, and hollered, ''Yee-hah! Viva tequila!''</p>
        <p>EXECUTIVE PURSUITS E-mail: pursuits@nytimes.com</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 12, 2007, Thursday  The Executive Pursuits column in Business Day on Saturday, about tasting tequila, referred incompletely to the territories in Mexico that are allowed to call their agave-based drinks tequila. The Tequila Regulatory Council of the Mexican government recognizes five territories -- not just Jalisco -- as sources for the production of tequila. The others are Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit and Tamaulipas. The column also misattributed a literary quotation about the process of going bankrupt, which was likened to overindulging in tequila. The reference to ''gradually and then suddenly'' was from ''The Sun Also Rises'' by Ernest Hemingway, not from F. Scott Fitzgerald.</p>

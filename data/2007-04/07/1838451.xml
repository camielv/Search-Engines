        <p>Max Pollak has a particular way of moving bodies. His group, RumbaTap, which he describes as ''an explosive, dancing body percussion ensemble,'' is deeply influenced by Afro-Cuban culture.</p>
        <p>In what is essentially a full-bodied experience, dancers slap their bodies while singing and tapping. Instruments aren't entirely necessary in such a realm, but in Mr. Pollak's ''ViiS,'' a tap and musical drama presented Thursday night at the Joyce SoHo, musicians are every bit as integral as the dancers.</p>
        <p>Inspired by spirits in African folklore and by the Finnish epic poem the Kalevala, Mr. Pollak's new production features five musicians, one main singer, four dancers and some very muddy storytelling. Taking its title from a Finnish word for the number five, the number of beats in the poetic meter of the Kalevala, ''ViiS'' tries to evoke a landscape in which a battle is fought over the Sampo, a magic mill. In program notes, Mr. Pollak refers to the prize as a machine ''capable of producing wealth for the owner in the form of flour, salt and coins.''</p>
        <p>In this truncated and oblique version of the epic, with Chikako Iwahori as co-director, six characters are portrayed by dancers (Mr. Pollak, in white, portrays a male warrior), and by musicians who periodically join the performers for duets. Pure tap sections are more absorbing than those in which the dancers try to channel their characters, but generally the two are incongruous, and ''ViiS'' is confusing and rambling.</p>
        <p>Lynn Schwab, representing love and sensuality, dances with an odd frozen smile, while Ms. Iwahori, in her depiction of fury, is so grim that her persona is unintentionally comic. As the young challenger, DeWitt Fleming Jr. is full of force, but little else.</p>
        <p>The story is essentially about how evil and greed give way to redemption, and so the red light that Ms. Iwahori seems to swallow in one dramatic gulp represents fire or the sun and, eventually, hope. Mr. Pollak, with flourish, pulls it from her mouth, and peace is restored. But it's hard to grasp just how tap dance fits into the vision; ultimately, Mr. Pollak's grand gesture gets lost in the shuffle.</p>
        <p>''ViiS'' continues through tomorrow at the Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street; (212) 334-7479 or joyce.org.</p>

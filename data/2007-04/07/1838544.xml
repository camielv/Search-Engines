        <p>Beijing Checks Idol Worship</p>
        <p>Government censors in Beijing moved yesterday to rein ''Happy Boy,'' China's version of ''American Idol,'' Agence France-Presse reported. The finale of last season's version of the show, ''Super Girl,'' won by Li Yuchun, right, was watched by 400 million viewers, roughly one-third of China's population. ''No weirdness, no vulgarity, no low taste,'' were among the restrictions imposed on the show's producers by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, according to a notice posted on the administration's Web site. In addition, relatives and contestants must do their best not to cry, scream or wail in order to ''maintain a happy and inspiring atmosphere,'' and the judges are prohibited from ''mocking or humiliating contestants.'' Contestants must only sing ''healthy and ethically inspiring'' songs, and the show must not indulge in ''gossip.'' The censor's notice said the rules were aimed at ''preparing a good atmosphere'' before the Communist Party's national congress late this year. The publication of the new rules came amid the initial search for ''Happy Boy'' contestants. Ten thousand people have already applied in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province. The search goes nationwide today.</p>
        <p>A Photographer's Legacy</p>
        <p>The foundation established after the death of the celebrity photographer Herb Ritts is donating $2.5 million and 189 of his works to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which plans to create a photography gallery in his name, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Mr. Ritts, who died in 2002 at 50, photographed the famous, often for magazines like Vogue and Vanity Fair. The museum mounted a show of his work in 1996 that was derided by many critics but proved to be one of its most popular exhibitions. ''The museum was making a major statement about accessibility, about what we thought was art, and what we thought were the preoccupations of a younger generation in America,'' said Malcolm Rogers, the Boston museum's director. The gift is the largest ever by the Herb Ritts Foundation, which has focused largely on AIDS-related causes since it was founded in 2003.</p>
        <p>Venice's Pop Menace</p>
        <p>Conservation organizations say that St. Mark's Square in Venice, below, could be damaged by two concerts to be staged there on June 5 and 6 June by Elton John, The Art Newspaper reported on Thursday. A 1989 concert there by Pink Floyd was attended by about 200,000 people, who left a mess that took three days to clean up. Two sixth-century columns next to the Basilica of St. Mark's were damaged when fans climbed them to get a better view. Anna Somers Cocks, who leads Venice in Peril, a group seeking to preserve the city, said, ''There is no parallel with the Pink Floyd concert as the numbers for Elton John will be strictly controlled, but there is some concern about the weight of the open-air theater and the people on the square as there is a complex system of drains underneath it.'' Maurizio Zanetto, secretary of the Venetian branch of the heritage organization Italia Nostra, said, ''We will do what we can to lobby against the Elton John concerts and raise awareness of the potential damage that will be done to St. Mark's Square.'' But Maurizio Calligaro, chief of staff for the mayor of Venice, noted that a crowd of 5,000 -- the size to which each concert will be limited -- pales beside the 35,000 people who gather in the square on New Year's Eve. Tickets are already on sale online for the concerts, though the city, which will be paid about 200,000 Euros ($268,730) for the use of the square, is not expected to give its permission for the events until next week. Gary Farrow, a spokesman for Elton John, said the singer ''looks forward to a beautiful and harmonious event in the city.''</p>
        <p>Art and Abbatoirs</p>
        <p>Some neighbors of the artist Damien Hirst in the Cotswolds, in central England, are upset over plans to include an ''abattoir rail'' at one of his studios, The Guardian reported on Thursday. The rail could be used to move animal carcasses before they are suspended in formaldehyde, a technique Mr. Hirst, below, made famous through works like ''Mother and Child Divided,'' a cow and a calf each cut in half and displayed in a tank of the preservative. A petition has been started and placards posted around the studio, an old manufacturing plant. Vicky Radwell, whose home overlooks the studio, pronounced herself ''gobsmacked'' by the news. ''Most people around here are quite horrified that there are going to be dead animals there,'' she said ''Dead animals in art is just outrageous. It's not beautiful, is it?'' A spokeswoman for Mr. Hirst said: ''This is nothing to do with an abattoir. It is an area where we will be using formaldehyde. That has been approved and we have planning permission for it. We never have -- and never would -- need an abattoir.''</p>
        <p>Who's the Wild One?</p>
        <p>The founder of the company that produces the ''Girls Gone Wild'' video series has defied a federal judge, refusing to surrender to United States marshals on a contempt citation, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Judge Richard Smoak of United States District Court ordered the company's founder, Joseph R. Francis, into custody after settlement negotiations stalled in a lawsuit brought by seven women who were minors when Mr. Francis' company, Mantra Films, videotaped them at the beach in Panama City, Fla. Mr. Francis, 34, who makes an estimated $29 million a year through the videos of girls exposing their breasts, drew the contempt order on Wednesday after lawyers for the women said Mr. Francis had threatened them during negotiations. ''This judge has gone as far as to call me the devil and an evildoer,'' Mr. Francis said on Thursday. ''It is a case of a judge gone wild.'' Mr. Francis's lawyers have appealed the order, which would send him to jail.</p>

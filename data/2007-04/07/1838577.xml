        <p>Detectives in Atherton arrested two people in a $100,000 wine theft from the cellar of a private residence. The 450 bottles that were stolen between Dec. 28 and Jan. 4 included a rare 1959 magnum from Château Pétrus in Bordeaux. The suspects, Zhi Mua Deng, 50, a domestic worker who had access to the house, and Xiao Yan Xiang, 52, were taken into custody after cameras installed by the police caught them returning to the cellar. ''It was just greed on the part of the crooks,'' said Detective Sgt. Joseph C. Wade, who was in charge of the investigation. ''The cellar was locked, but she had a key.'' The two are charged with burglary, conspiracy and possession of stolen property. At the suspects' residences, the police found wine boxes, but only three bottles of wine. ''We are still looking at what happened to the wine,'' Sergeant Wade said.</p>

        <p>The Food and Drug Administration yesterday ordered drug companies to stop making and selling anti-nausea suppositories containing a drug that the agency said did not work when used in that form.</p>
        <p>The move was part of a campaign by the agency to re-evaluate drugs approved before 1962, the year drug makers had to start proving that their products worked. Before 1962, they had to prove only that they did no harm.</p>
        <p>The suppositories, sold by prescription under the names Tigan, Tebamide, T-Gen, Trimazide and Trimethobenz, all contain the active ingredient trimethobenzamide.</p>
        <p>About two million such suppositories are sold each year, said Dr. Jason Woo, an official in the agency's compliance office.</p>
        <p>Trimethobenzamide in other forms, including pills and injectables, does have F.D.A. approval for use against nausea and vomiting, the agency said.</p>
        <p>The agency has had evidence since 1979 that trimethobenzamide suppositories do not work. But the review ''requires a lengthy analysis,'' Dr. Woo said. Also, the drug makers requested a hearing, ''which further slowed the process,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last June, the agency began ''reinvigorating'' the process, said Deborah M. Autor, the compliance office's director.</p>
        <p>Since then, it has removed its previous approvals of products containing quinine for leg cramps, ergotamine tartrate for migraines and carbinoxamine for children's allergies and colds.</p>
        <p>Although the agency estimates that less than 2 percent of prescription drugs sold now are unapproved, it believes there are ''several hundred'' unapproved active ingredients in prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>Representatives of the companies making the suppositories could not be reached yesterday because of the holiday. The companies have until May 9 to comply with the F.D.A. order.</p>

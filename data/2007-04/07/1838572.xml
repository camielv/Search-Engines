        <p>The United States reached a free trade agreement with South Korea, its biggest since the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.</p>
        <p>The deal, if ratified by Congress, means cheaper Hyundai and Kia cars for American consumers; Washington agreed to lift 2.5 percent tariffs on South Korean cars. The deal will also remove South Korea's 8 percent import duty on cars and phase out heavier tariffs on beef and oranges, helping American car companies, ranchers and farmers expand in South Korea, where consumers are developing a taste for foreign goods.</p>

        <p>The United States reached a free trade agreement with South Korea, its biggest since the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.</p>
        <p>The deal, if ratified by Congress, means cheaper Hyundai and Kia cars for American consumers; Washington agreed to lift 2.5 percent tariffs on South Korean cars. The deal will also remove South Korea's 8 percent import duty on cars and phase out heavier tariffs on beef and oranges, helping American car companies, ranchers and farmers expand in South Korea, where consumers are developing a taste for foreign goods.</p>
        <p>American cattle farmers, kicked out of the South Korean beef market three years ago after an outbreak of mad cow disease, lobbied for an immediate re-entry. That wish was not fulfilled during the trade talks.</p>
        <p>In coming months, each government faces the task of persuading its legislature to agree to the pact, which they say will add $20 billion to bilateral trade. They will continue to talk, meanwhile, on whether, and how fast, South Korea should lift its ban on American beef.</p>

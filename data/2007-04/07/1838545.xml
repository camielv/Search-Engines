        <p>The Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J., which is facing a $2.8 million shortfall at the end of its season, is continuing its efforts to stay afloat. About $300,000 in donations collected over the past few weeks will keep the theater running and allow the production of ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,'' above, to begin on Wednesday as scheduled, said Kenneth Thorn, the chairman of the theater's board of trustees. The board is working to secure a bank loan that would cover the rest of the season, Mr. Thorn said, though it is continuing to solicit contributions to lower the amount needed. The Paper Mill will hold a rally on Monday at the theater, with several state officials and Broadway performers expected to attend.</p>

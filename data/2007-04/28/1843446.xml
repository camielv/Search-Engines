        <p>The racing season at Keeneland closed under a gunmetal sky Friday. A year ago, Michael Matz prepared to make the 75-mile drive to Churchill Downs in Louisville, where he would train the great and fragile Barbaro to victory in the Kentucky Derby. This year, Matz made only consolation plans, a flight home to suburban Philadelphia. He may get no closer to the Derby on May 5 than his television.</p>
        <p>Dressed in a blue cap and jacket against the Friday morning chill, the slender, handsome Matz pushed a wheelbarrow laden with feed along the backside of Barn 24 at Keeneland.

        <p>The racing season at Keeneland closed under a gunmetal sky Friday. A year ago, Michael Matz prepared to make the 75-mile drive to Churchill Downs in Louisville, where he would train the great and fragile Barbaro to victory in the Kentucky Derby. This year, Matz made only consolation plans, a flight home to suburban Philadelphia. He may get no closer to the Derby on May 5 than his television.</p>
        <p>Dressed in a blue cap and jacket against the Friday morning chill, the slender, handsome Matz pushed a wheelbarrow laden with feed along the backside of Barn 24 at Keeneland. His prized 3-year-old, the dark-bay colt Chelokee, wore a tartan blanket and ate from a ball of hay that hung from his stall like a piñata.</p>
        <p>Matz had hoped for a second consecutive victory at the Kentucky Derby, but the field is limited to 20 thoroughbreds, based on earnings in stakes races. Chelokee ranks tied for 22nd on the earnings list after he was squeezed along the rail and finished third last month at the Florida Derby.</p>
        <p>A Kentucky Derby berth could open if other horses withdraw, but Chelokee sustained an abscessed heel in the last week after he wore the wrong shoe, Matz said. The colt also galloped an extra mile after a rein broke and his exercise rider could not easily bring him to a halt.</p>
        <p>''It might be little things telling me I should just wait,'' Matz, 56, said.</p>
        <p>So he booked a Saturday flight to Philadelphia. On Sunday, Chelokee is scheduled to travel overnight to the Fair Hill Training Center in Elkton, Md., to begin preparations for the Preakness on May 19, Matz said.</p>
        <p>''I don't look at it as, Poor me, I didn't get in the Kentucky Derby again,'' Matz said. ''I feel like I still have a nice horse and I'm going to miss one race.''</p>
        <p>He laughed.</p>
        <p>''It might be the biggest race in America, but hopefully, I'll have some more races,'' Matz said. ''It's a long year.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Matz plans to spend what is certain to be a bittersweet day at Delaware Park, where Barbaro won his maiden race Oct. 4, 2005. Some 200 to 500 fans of Barbaro are expected there to memorialize the euthanized colt on what would have been his fourth birthday.</p>
        <p>As Matz spoke in a tack room Friday, it was clear how much fondness he had for Barbaro. He laughed, but he also fidgeted with his fingers. At times, he voice quivered, and tears seemed to come into his eyes.</p>
        <p>''It was certainly heartbreaking, being so close to that horse,'' Matz said. ''He felt like one of my children. You'd go in and see him every day. You'd see him eat, sleep, do everything.''</p>
        <p>Peter Brette, Matz's assistant trainer, said that he still dreamed of Barbaro. And what did he see in his imaginings?</p>
        <p>''All the races he should have won,'' Brette said. ''We never knew how good he was. That's the hardest part. We never knew.''</p>
        <p>Barbaro dominated the 2006 Kentucky Derby by six and a half lengths, the largest margin of victory in six decades. But thoroughbreds possess a brittle excellence. Two weeks later, Barbaro took a horrific misstep in the Preakness, shattering his right hind ankle and his career.</p>
        <p>For eight months, a nation followed his every operation, kept rapt by medical reports that were by turn hopeful and despairing. Barbaro's interrupted glory and his persistence in his fight to survive brought a great outpouring, but affection was no cure-all for the medical complications that interrupted his healing. On Jan. 29, the colt was put to sleep.</p>
        <p>Matz said that he wrestled with questions. Could he have done anything differently to save his colt? Speaking of Dr. Dean Richardson, the veterinarian who treated Barbaro in Kennett Square, Pa., Matz praised him, then said, ''There's things I would have changed.''</p>
        <p>What things? Matz was asked. He thought for a moment, then corrected himself, saying: ''I don't think that's fair to say right now. I do think Dean will look back and say, 'Maybe I should have done this.' I think that's only natural. I do think he really tried the best of his ability to save that horse.''</p>
        <p>Matz spoke more eagerly about the thousands of letters of support he had received from around the world. One, he said, came from a 10-year-old boy named Mateo, an orphan in Namibia who has AIDS.</p>
        <p>Mateo, who was interested in horses, sent photographs and drew a picture of Barbaro. He was also curious about Matz's experience as an equestrian. (Matz is a three-time Olympian and was a silver medalist at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.) Matz's wife, D. D., wrote to Mateo, and the headmistress of the orphanage replied, saying that the boy had been left with a ''grin from ear to ear.''</p>
        <p>''He went into the next classroom and got under the table so the other kids wouldn't know who the letter was from,'' Matz said. ''The headmistress said that he slept with the letter and carried it all the time.''</p>
        <p>His own sense of tragedy -- forged from surviving a 1989 plane crash in Sioux City, Iowa, and rescuing three children from the wreckage -- has left Matz with this sober perspective about Barbaro: He will never forget the colt, but he cannot let himself be consumed by Barbaro's memory.</p>
        <p>''I'll always remember I was in an airplane accident, but I can't evolve around that accident,'' Matz said. ''People have to go on. With Barbaro, these are times when you remember him and are sensitive about the situation.''</p>
        <p>His voice breaking, Matz added, ''Also, I feel I can look back and say the only things I have now are the good things he did -- winning every other race he was in.''</p>
        <p>Matz plans to attend a trainers' dinner in Louisville next Tuesday. If Barbaro's owners, Roy and Gretchen Jackson, invite him to attend the Kentucky Derby, Matz will join them. Otherwise, he plans to watch from home on television, rather than maintain a slim hope that Chelokee will somehow become eligible.</p>
        <p>He has an improving horse, one that has won two of six races. Yet, Matz said, it will be a cavalry charge to the first turn in the Derby, and if Chelokee is not fully ready, it could jeopardize a promising spring and summer.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't have taken him over there unless we thought we had a chance to win,'' Matz said. ''I don't want to go there just to say I've competed in the Kentucky Derby. Especially after you went once and won it. What's the sense? It's fun while everything is going on, but after the Derby is over and you're trying to pick up the pieces, that's the part that's not so fun.''</p>
        <p>There was more hopeful news in the past week. Last Friday, a younger brother of Barbaro's was born here at Mill Ridge Farm. The foal weighed 148 pounds and was ''all legs,'' Matz said. A day later, he said, the colt galloped around the paddock.</p>
        <p>''It looked like a miniature Barbaro,'' Matz said. ''It was spooky.''</p>
        <p>Matz let himself dream for a moment.</p>
        <p>''Can you imagine three years from now if we're getting him ready for the Kentucky Derby?'' he told the farm manager.</p>
        <p>The manager replied: ''Do you know the odds of that? That's like winning the Powerball twice.''</p>
        <p>Matz said: ''There's nothing we can do to bring Barbaro back. We have to remember the good times. I doubt if I'll ever get one as good. But you've got to keep hoping. That's what keeps us getting up in the morning and coming out here.''</p>

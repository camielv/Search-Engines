        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Shifting Tone on Immigration, Candidate Giuliani Talks Tough'' (front page, April 22) suggests that Rudolph W. Giuliani has been inconsistent on the treatment of illegal immigrants. Allegedly as mayor of New York City, he befriended them. As a presidential candidate, he denounces the proposed legislation offered by President Bush that would provide illegals with amnesty.</p>
        <p>I am not a supporter of Rudy Giuliani and wrote a book entitled ''Giuliani, Nasty Man.'' Nevertheless, the flip-flop attack is unfair.</p>
        <p>It was I who issued the original executive orders that put into effect the policies concerning education for children here illegally, hospital care for illegal immigrants at New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation facilities for those unable to afford private doctors, and a direction to law enforcement personnel not to arrest an individual reporting a crime simply because of undocumented (illegal) status, unless he or she had committed some other crime as well.</p>
        <p>All of these provisions, while compassionate toward illegals, were for the protection of those living in the United States lawfully as well.</p>
        <p>It is far better to keep children in school than to have them wander the streets; medical care may prevent the spread of contagious diseases; and reporting crimes may prevent later assaults on others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's actions, then and now, are consistent.</p>
        <p>Edward I. Koch  New York, April 24, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is the former mayor of New York.</p>

        <p>Philip Johnson's Glass House in New Canaan, Conn., will open to the public for the first time on Monday. The architect, who died in 2005, donated the house and its 47-acre property to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which is starting a study center on the estate. The 1949 house, above, a single room 56 feet by 32 feet, is among the symbols of Modernist architecture, and Mr. Johnson, who died there at 98, had wanted the estate to become a museum. Three other structures on the site, also designed by Mr. Johnson, will be open as well. Two contain art that he collected with his partner, David Whitney, who also died in 2005. Tours, at $25 for 90 minutes and $40 for two hours, are limited to 10 people and require reservations; the official opening is June 23. The house will be closed from November to April each year. Reservations: philipjohnsonglasshouse.org</p>

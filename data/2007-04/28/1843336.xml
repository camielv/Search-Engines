        <p>The most popular regional is held in Gatlinburg, Tenn., in April. This year's, which ended on April 15, set a record, with more than 10,000 tables in play during the event's seven days. This is better than at some nationals, which run for 10 days. Also, Robert Hampton of Blythewood, S.C., collected 230.18 master points, the largest number won at any regional.</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal comes from a knockout team event won by Hampton and his teammates, David Berkowitz and Larry Cohen of Boca Raton, Fla.; Jerry Helms of Charlotte, N.C.; Bobby Levin of New York; and Steve Weinstein of Andes, N.Y.</p>

        <p>The most popular regional is held in Gatlinburg, Tenn., in April. This year's, which ended on April 15, set a record, with more than 10,000 tables in play during the event's seven days. This is better than at some nationals, which run for 10 days. Also, Robert Hampton of Blythewood, S.C., collected 230.18 master points, the largest number won at any regional.</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal comes from a knockout team event won by Hampton and his teammates, David Berkowitz and Larry Cohen of Boca Raton, Fla.; Jerry Helms of Charlotte, N.C.; Bobby Levin of New York; and Steve Weinstein of Andes, N.Y.</p>
        <p>At both tables the contract was four spades. West led the club eight -- either lowest from an odd number of cards or third-highest from an even number, which is a popular method in the tournament world. East won with his ace and shifted to the diamond king. How should South have continued?</p>
        <p>In this auction Cohen (South) opened with a strong club, promising at least 16 points. Berkowitz (North) responded with a negative one diamond, showing 0-7 points. South's one-spade rebid was natural and forcing for one round. North's two diamonds described exactly three-card spade support and 5-7 points. Three no-trump offered a choice of games, North preferring four spades.</p>
        <p>This is the type of deal in which an expert usually gains points. An initial diamond lead would have been fatal, but when East switched to that suit at Trick 2, it would have been easy for South to go wrong. A less experienced player would assume that the major suits were splitting favorably. He would take the second trick, then probably adopt one of two plans. He might unblock the ace-king of hearts before drawing three rounds of trumps ending on the board. With this unfriendly layout, though, he would fail.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, South, after taking the second trick, might cash the club king, ruff a club on the board, play off the ace-king of hearts and draw two rounds of trumps ending on the board. That would leave this position:</p>
        <p>Declarer cashes dummy's heart queen, discarding a diamond from his hand. But West ruffs and plays a diamond to his partner. Then the lead of the heart jack promotes West's spade jack as the fourth defensive trick. South loses two spades, one diamond and one club.</p>
        <p>Somehow sensing this, Cohen ducked East's diamond king at Trick 2. East continued with another diamond, and declarer followed the second line given above, producing the same end position, except that each hand had one fewer diamond. Now when West trumped the heart queen and led a diamond, South ruffed and drew West's remaining trump.</p>
        <p>At the other table four spades failed, so the Hampton team gained 12 international match points.</p>
        <p>The Hamden Sectional takes place May 4-6 at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Hamden, Conn. Details are at ctbridge.org/schedule/sch0705.pdf.</p>

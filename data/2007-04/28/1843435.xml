        <p>Blue chip stocks surged all week as many big companies reported better-than-expected results, though mixed economic data might quiet the enthusiasm next week. No such hesitation was evident among cash-rich equity buyers, though, as acquisitions continued apace, one with a new feature.</p>
        <p>A DOW MILESTONE -- The Dow Jones industrial average broke through the 13,000 mark this week and kept climbing, even as concerns mounted about the slowing economy and the housing market.</p>
        <p>The index, supported by solid earning reports from industrial companies, is on track to post its best monthly gain since December 2003.</p>
        <p>The stock market has also been helped by share buybacks and acquisitions by private equity firms.</p>
        <p>The rally's future will depend on how corporations fare in a weakening economy, which slowed to a 1.3 percent rate in the first quarter. With inflation still elevated, the Federal Reserve may not be as quick to cut short-term interest rates as some investors have hoped.</p>
        <p>Optimists hope growing exports will insulate companies from troubles in the domestic market, but skeptics worry that the economy has not yet felt the full impact of problems in the housing market.</p>

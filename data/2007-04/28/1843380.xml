      <abstract>
        <p>Dr Arnold S Relman letter holds that until we rid ourselves of myth that private market outperforms other alternatives in health care, we will never develop good-quality, affordable system that covers everyone (Paul Krugman April 20 Op-Ed and April 21 editorial)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Plot Against Medicare,'' by Paul Krugman (column, April 20), and your April 21 editorial ''The Medicare Privatization Scam'' correctly noted the higher costs of private for-profit health insurance. They might also have noted that a recent J. D. Powers survey found consumers more satisfied with not-for-profit private insurance plans than with investor-owned plans.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Plot Against Medicare,'' by Paul Krugman (column, April 20), and your April 21 editorial ''The Medicare Privatization Scam'' correctly noted the higher costs of private for-profit health insurance. They might also have noted that a recent J. D. Powers survey found consumers more satisfied with not-for-profit private insurance plans than with investor-owned plans.</p>
        <p>Even more important, as I have documented in my new book, ''A Second Opinion,'' there is good evidence that investor-owned medical care facilities are usually less efficient than comparable not-for-profit facilities. Further, their services are often of lower quality -- occasionally with serious consequences for the health of patients.</p>
        <p>Until we rid ourselves of the myth that the private market outperforms other alternatives in health care, we will never develop a good-quality, affordable system that covers everyone.</p>
        <p>Arnold S. Relman, M.D.  Boston, April 21, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer, professor emeritus of medicine and social medicine at Harvard Medical School, was the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, 1977-91.</p>

        <p>After spending weeks plotting the world's biggest banking takeover, Barclays on Monday announced an $87 billion stock deal to buy the Dutch bank ABN Amro.</p>
        <p>ABN Amro was in a hurry because Fred Goodwin, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, and his counterparts at Banco Santander Central Hispano of Spain and Fortis, a Belgian banking group, also wanted to buy ABN Amro but intended to split its assets among them.</p>
        <p>Rijkman W. J. Groenink, ABN Amro's chief executive, who opposes a breakup, also agreed on Monday to sell LaSalle Bank, ABN Amro's American operation and one of its most valuable assets, to the Bank of America for $21 billion.</p>
        <p>The sale angered Mr. Goodwin, who had his eyes on LaSalle, but instead of walking away he raised the ante. On Wednesday, he and his partners announced a bid worth $98.5 billion, but contingent on ABN Amro's keeping LaSalle.</p>
        <p>The next day, some shareholders accused Mr. Groenink at the company's annual general meeting of selling LaSalle to hinder a bidding contest.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Royal Bank group said it would outbid Barclays. But because of Dutch takeover regulations the Royal Bank group will have a three-day window after May 3 to formally submit its bid before ABN Amro completes its sale of LaSalle.</p>

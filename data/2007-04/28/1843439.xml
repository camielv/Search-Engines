        <p>In what would be the largest acquisition ever of a biotechnology company, AstraZeneca agreed Monday to pay $15.6 billion to acquire MedImmune, maker of the FluMist nasal spray flu vaccine.</p>
        <p>The deal, with AstraZeneca beating out several rivals, reflected the eagerness of big pharmaceutical companies to obtain new products to maintain growth as older products lose patent protection. So-called biologic drugs made in cell cultures look like a new area of growth to companies like AstraZeneca that have typically made chemical pills.</p>
        <p>The deal also highlighted the growing influence of hedge funds and activist investors in biotechnology. MedImmune, based in Gaithersburg, Md., put itself on the block after Carl C. Icahn threatened a proxy fight to force such an action.</p>
        <p>With many biotech companies presumably being worth more to a desperate pharmaceutical company than to public investors, it would not be surprising to see more biotech companies sold -- or forced to be sold.</p>

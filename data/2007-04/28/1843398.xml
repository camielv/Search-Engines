        <p>Only five Devils participated in an optional skate Friday afternoon, and one of them was Patrik Elias, their captain and top scorer.</p>
        <p>Elias, who missed the Devils' 5-4 loss Thursday to the Ottawa Senators because of the flu, said after skating for 30 minutes Friday that he was optimistic that he would play in Game 2 of the N.H.L. Eastern Conference semifinal series Saturday at Continental Arena. ''I feel good enough to play now,'' he said.</p>

        <p>Only five Devils participated in an optional skate Friday afternoon, and one of them was Patrik Elias, their captain and top scorer.</p>
        <p>Elias, who missed the Devils' 5-4 loss Thursday to the Ottawa Senators because of the flu, said after skating for 30 minutes Friday that he was optimistic that he would play in Game 2 of the N.H.L. Eastern Conference semifinal series Saturday at Continental Arena. ''I feel good enough to play now,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although he described his ailment as nothing more than a severe bug, with aches and a high fever, Elias's health is a sensitive issue because he contracted hepatitis A nearly two years ago. He missed the first 39 games of the 2005-6 season as a result.</p>
        <p>Elias, the left wing on the Devils' top line, led the team with 69 points in 75 games this season.</p>

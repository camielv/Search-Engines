        <p>China named Yang Jiechi, who was ambassador to the United States from 2001 to 2005, to become foreign minister, shuffling its diplomatic team as its rising economic power has given it greater sway in world affairs. Mr. Yang, 56, formerly a vice minister, is fluent in English and well known for a courteous but cautious manner. He replaces Li Zhaoxing, another English speaker and former ambassador to Washington, who is 66. No reason was given for the replacement, but Mr. Li had passed the retirement age for ministerial officials. Mr. Yang assumes the helm at a time when China has greatly expanded its diplomatic activities around the world, especially in Asia and Africa, and as its economic growth and increased military spending have raised concerns in some quarters that it may begin to challenge Washington for leadership in world affairs.</p>

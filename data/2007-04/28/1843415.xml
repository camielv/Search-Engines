        <p>Gere Conciliates</p>
        <p>A day after a judge in India issued a warrant for his arrest for kissing the Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty in public, Richard Gere offered an apology and asked the media ''to end the circus'' over the matter, Reuters reported yesterday. Mr. Gere's conciliatory statement marked a change from Thursday, when he said on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' that the controversy was the fault of ''a very small, right-wing, very conservative political party in India,'' adding that he expected the warrant to be thrown out. But yesterday, the actor, who twirled Ms. Shetty in his arms, dipped her backward and then kissed her several times on the cheek at an event in New Delhi this month to promote AIDS awareness among Indian truckers (above), said in a statement that ''my clumsy attempt at a 'Shall We Dance' dance move was a naïve misread of Indian customs.'' He added that he had intended no offense and described the charity event as a celebration of courageous people fighting H.I.V. and AIDS in India.</p>
        <p>And Shetty Diversifies</p>
        <p>As Mr. Gere sought to calm India's kiss-troubled waters, Ms. Shetty, the kissee and the winner of Britain's reality television show ''Celebrity Big Brother,'' said she would open a chain of Indian curry houses in Britain, Reuters reported. Ms. Shetty, who became a popular figure in Britain after she was insulted by some of her ''Big Brother'' housemates, triggering allegations of racial abuse, was reported in an Indian daily to be starting a chain of curry restaurants in the country, to be named the Shilpa Shetty Dining Hall.</p>
        <p>Albee Presents</p>
        <p>The playwright Edward Albee inaugurated a new drama award on Thursday, presenting the Yale Drama Series prize for aspiring playwrights to an Irish writer for a play about Siamese twins, Reuters reported. John Austin Connolly, a retired psychologist from Dublin, is the first winner of the new competition for emerging playwrights, with a prize of $10,000. Mr. Albee judged the competition, which drew more than 500 entries, organizers said. Mr. Connolly's play ''The Boys From Siam'' is based loosely on the lives of Chang and Eng Bunker, conjoined twins who in the 19th century became the original so-called Siamese twins. The play will be published by Yale University Press.</p>
        <p>Courts Giveth and Taketh</p>
        <p>Hugh Grant, who was arrested Wednesday by police over allegations that he threw a container of baked beans at a photographer, accepted undisclosed damages Friday from a British newspaper publisher over false claims about his relationships with his former girlfriends Jemima Khan and Elizabeth Hurley, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Grant had sued Associated Newspapers, publisher of The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, over stories published in February. Mr. Grant's lawyer, Simon Smith, said the actor would give the money to a cancer charity. In a statement, Mr. Grant said he had taken legal action because he was tired of the newspapers ''publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain.'' Associated Newspapers apologized to Mr. Grant and agreed to pay his legal costs.</p>

        <p>Kevin Kline will make his New York Philharmonic debut as the narrator of Prokofiev's ''Peter and the Wolf,'' July 5 at 7:30 p.m. and July 6 at 8 p.m. at Avery Fisher Hall, and on July 7 at 8 p.m. at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts in upstate New York. The Mexican singer Mariano Barba dominated the 2007 Billboard Latin Music Awards on Thursday, even winning for top song of the year, a prize usually reserved for pop stars like Shakira, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Barba won three awards in the Mexican regional music category, and his ballad ''Aliado del Tiempo'' (''Ally of Time'') won for hot Latin song. Colombia's Shakira and the Haitian-American rapper and producer Wyclef Jean won best duet for ''Hips Don't Lie.'' The Venezuelan singer Ricardo Montaner was honored for his work with disabled children.</p>

        <p>10 P.M. (Showtime) EDMOND -- (2005) After a tarot card reader tells him, ''You are not where you belong,'' a nebbishy businessman walks out on his marriage and unleashes his long-suppressed rage -- and sexual desires -- in this explosive adaptation of David Mamet's 1982 one-act play. Stephen Holden, writing in The New York Times, said that William H. Macy, above, ''a master at playing sticks of human dynamite in mild-mannered camouflage,'' gives ''the nerviest screen performance of his career.''</p>
        <p>11 A.M. (SNY) JETS NATION: DRAFT DAY '07 -- SportsNet New York begins its two-day coverage of the National Football League draft, featuring interviews with the Jets head coach, Eric Mangini, and general manager, Mike Tannenbaum, as well as player profiles, analysis of the Jets' draft needs and interviews with the players selected. The quarterback Kellen Clemens, last year's second-round pick, and the running back Leon Washington, the fourth-round selection, will broadcast live from the SNY plaza across from Radio City Music Hall, where the draft will be held. Additional programming will be shown live tonight at 9:30 and tomorrow at 10 a.m. and 9:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (ABC) PROTECT OUR CHILDREN: TOO SEXY, TOO YOUNG? -- Diana Williams looks at the early sexualization of children and the efforts of the Long Island Professional Education Network and SearchHelp, a developer of parental-control software, to educate parents and children about the dangers of the Internet.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (21) SAM COOKE: LEGEND -- This authorized biography reviews the career of Mr. Cooke, the voice behind ''You Send Me'' and ''Wonderful World,'' through performances and interviews with his fellow musicians, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Lloyd Price, who will speak live from the studio.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Logo) FREDDIE MERCURY: MAGIC REMIXED -- No bed of roses: this musical journey through the thorny life and times of Freddie Mercury, right, the lead singer of Queen, travels from his Indian ancestry to his death from AIDS, and includes interviews with Elton John and Boy George, concert footage and home videos.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) AMERICA'S MOST WANTED: AMERICA FIGHTS BACK -- Lauren Nelson, Miss America, helps John Walsh and a special police unit go after online sexual predators.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Sci Fi) LAKE PLACID 2 -- (2007) The second time around for the giant crocodiles with enormous appetites in a groggy upstate town. John Schneider, Chad Collins (left) and Cloris Leachman star.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (History Channel) THE STATES -- Part 2 of this 10-episode cram course in United States history makes stops in Texas, Massachusetts, Arkansas and other states to dissect events that include the discovery of oil in 1901, the arrival of the Puritans and the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957.</p>

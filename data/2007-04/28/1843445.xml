        <p>Six Penn State football players were charged yesterday for what the authorities said were their various roles in an off-campus fight.</p>
        <p>The starting safety Anthony Scirrotto faces the most serious charges: felony counts of burglary and criminal solicitation. He and the others also face felony criminal trespassing charges.</p>
        <p>The other players are the reserve lineman Chris Baker, who was also charged with felony burglary; Justin King, who was expected to return as a starter in the defensive secondary; the projected starting corner Lydell Sargeant; and the reserves Jerome Hayes and Tyrell Sales.</p>
        <p>The charges stem from a confrontation between three men and Scirrotto and a female friend outside an apartment complex in State College, Pa., early on April 1, according to the police. After the initial confrontation, Scirrotto and the others entered an apartment where the men were. That led to a melee that Hayes described in court papers as ''chaos for five straight minutes.'' The accusers said in the court papers that they were punched and that one had a beer bottle broken over his head.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how the case will affect the status of the players for the coming season. Penn State Coach Joe Paterno issued a statement saying that a decision would be made after due process.</p>
        <p>''We are very concerned with the accusations made today and will determine the appropriate consequence for each player's status on the team when due process has transpired,'' Paterno said. ''Until such time, we will have no further comment regarding the situation.''</p>
        <p>Michael Madeira, the Centre County district attorney, said in a telephone interview yesterday that if the case proceeded to trial, it would probably not occur until August. Penn State opens its season against Florida International at home Sept. 1 and plays host to Notre Dame the next weekend.</p>
        <p>Scirrotto led Penn State with six interceptions last season, and King entered the program as a top recruit in 2005.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Skeptical Vietnam Voice Still Echoes in the Fog of Iraq,'' by Dexter Filkins (An Appraisal, April 25):</p>
        <p>Mr. Filkins was right to thank David Halberstam for helping us to have a clearer picture of the Iraq war. It was through the courageous reporting of Mr. Halberstam and his colleagues -- many of whom later became reporters for The New York Times -- that this country learned the truth about the Vietnam War.</p>
        <p>His example has clearly inspired Mr. Filkins and others to search for the truth about the conflict in Iraq. While laudable, this is never a popular stance to take with governments that promote war, or an easy choice to make for someone who loves his country.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Halberstam pointed out in 1983 in an interview with me regarding a proposed program about the history of the war correspondent: ''We became caught between the traditional definitions of loyalty, patriotism, salute the flag and a higher definition, it seemed to me, of democracy, the need to tell the truth.''</p>
        <p>David Halberstam will be missed, but it's heartening to know that his legacy, ''the need to tell the truth,'' lives on.</p>

        <p>All six campuses of Broward Community College and two university campuses in South Florida were evacuated and searched by the police after a note threatening an attack was found. The note, mentioning the Virginia Tech killings and threatening a similar attack at the community college, was written on a poster board and found at a Hollywood construction site, said Capt. Tony Rode, a spokesman for the Hollywood police. Florida Atlantic University officials evacuated two campuses that share space with the community college. Earlier this week, the police arrested a man they say admitted writing a note threatening to bomb a Hollywood middle school and another one threatening to set fire to an apartment building. The man, Larry Boynton, 52, is considered a person of interest in the college threat, Captain Rode said.</p>

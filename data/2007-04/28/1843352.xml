        <p>General Motors nearly doubled the compensation for its chief executive, Rick Wagoner, last year, even though he voluntarily reduced his salary to aid the automaker's restructuring effort, G.M. disclosed Friday in its annual proxy filing.</p>
        <p>G.M. valued Mr. Wagoner's 2006 pay package at $10.2 million, up from $5.5 million in 2005. Most of the compensation came in the form of stock awards and options, and he received no bonus for a second year. Mr. Wagoner's base salary, which had been $2.2 million since 2003, was cut to $1.3 million last year at his request.</p>

        <p>General Motors nearly doubled the compensation for its chief executive, Rick Wagoner, last year, even though he voluntarily reduced his salary to aid the automaker's restructuring effort, G.M. disclosed Friday in its annual proxy filing.</p>
        <p>G.M. valued Mr. Wagoner's 2006 pay package at $10.2 million, up from $5.5 million in 2005. Most of the compensation came in the form of stock awards and options, and he received no bonus for a second year. Mr. Wagoner's base salary, which had been $2.2 million since 2003, was cut to $1.3 million last year at his request.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagoner and other top executives, including the vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, and the chief financial officer, Frederick A. Henderson, will continue to receive reduced salaries in 2007.</p>
        <p>Including noncash compensation, Mr. Lutz earned $8.4 million in 2006, nearly triple the $3 million he received the previous year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henderson, who became G.M.'s chief financial officer in January 2006, earned $5.2 million in his first year on the job. His predecessor, John M. Devine, earned $3.9 million in 2005.</p>
        <p>G.M. said 2007 base salaries will be $1.7 million for Mr. Wagoner and $1.3 million for Mr. Lutz and Mr. Henderson. Their total compensation for the current year was not disclosed.</p>
        <p>For the second consecutive year, none of the automaker's top executives received cash bonuses in 2006. G.M. also did not award its workers bonuses or profit-sharing checks last year, when it lost $2 billion, a significant improvement over the $10.4 billion it lost in 2005.</p>
        <p>In a letter to shareholders distributed Friday as part of G.M.'s annual report, Mr. Wagoner called the improved performance in 2006 ''validation that we have the right strategy'' but noted that the company still has a difficult path ahead.</p>
        <p>''Rest assured, nobody at G.M. is declaring victory,'' he said. ''We all know there's a lot more work to do to achieve our business goals of steady growth, solid profitability and positive cash generation. And yet, we improved further and faster in 2006 than many people thought possible.''</p>
        <p>Executive compensation is being watched particularly closely this year by the United Automobile Workers union, whose contract with the Detroit automakers expires in September. Negotiations for a new labor agreement will begin this summer.</p>
        <p>Some union members have criticized the Ford Motor Company for paying its chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, more than $28 million in his first four months on the job. Most of that amount came in the form of a hiring bonus and compensation to make up for benefits he forfeited in leaving his previous job at the jet maker Boeing.</p>
        <p>To appease workers who were upset at the prospect of bonuses for management, Ford paid all employees modest bonuses of at least $300 in March. All hourly workers represented by the U.A.W. were given $500.</p>

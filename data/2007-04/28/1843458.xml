        <p>A Palestinian security officer was shot dead in a clash with local residents at the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza, Palestinian officials said. The officer, Abdulrahman Abu Teir, 24, was killed after armed members of a family tried to barge into the terminal without waiting in line, witnesses said. Palestinian security forces control the passenger crossing into Egypt, under the supervision of European monitors, but Israel determines when it will be open. The crossing was opened Thursday for the first time since April 19, but it was too crowded to operate, a spokeswoman for the European monitoring mission said. Up to 5,000 Gazans arrived at the crossing yesterday. It remained open all day, the spokeswoman said, because the unrest occurred outside the terminal itself.</p>

        <p>Of Gregory Jacobs's thriller ''Wind Chill,'' let us first give thanks for what it isn't: a procession of teenage corpses, and, to avoid the more vulgar expression, torture-tainment.

        <p>Opened yesterday in New York, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Seattle, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago and Minneapolis.  Directed by Gregory Jacobs  87 minutes</p>
        <p>Of Gregory Jacobs's thriller ''Wind Chill,'' let us first give thanks for what it isn't: a procession of teenage corpses, and, to avoid the more vulgar expression, torture-tainment. That said, let us give thanks for what it largely is: a moody, spooky tale, rendered with laudable economy.</p>
        <p>A college student (Emily Blunt) hooks up with another (Ashton Holmes) for a ride home at Christmas break, and gradually learns of his hidden past. After a hit and run on a remote, snow-swept country road, the two discover that their route has its secrets too.</p>
        <p>The principals' badinage has charm and understated perversity, and the production values display the finesse fitting a movie counting George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh among its producers. Though it reaches its climax, after the requisite jolts, with undue haste, ''Wind Chill'' mostly has a measured, frosty ambience that lets its performances warm the screen.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Holmes vacillates fluidly between cherubic innocence and veiled menace, this is Ms. Blunt's movie. The actress, a strong asset in ''The Devil Wears Prada,'' has a winning way with melting hauteur, and she easily carries this spare diversion. Expect her to carry much bigger movies before long.</p>
        <p>ANDY WEBSTER</p>
        <p>''Wind Chill'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and mild violence.</p>

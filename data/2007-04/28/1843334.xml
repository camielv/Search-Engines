        <p>When Christopher Hogwood founded the Academy of Ancient Music in 1973, the early-music movement was often equated with dry playing and odd sounds from obdurate period instruments. On Thursday night, while watching and listening to the group in a delightfully engaging concert at Zankel Hall, it was striking how much freedom this movement now affords.</p>
        <p>An early-music ensemble like the academy, although established, still has to consider certain existential parameters: what is its philosophy toward the music it is making? How does it play it? What does its presentation say about the music and the group? Compare the musicians with the players in a standard orchestra, whose task is too often simply to put on penguin suits and execute the works without the same kind of exploration of their musical identities.</p>

        <p>When Christopher Hogwood founded the Academy of Ancient Music in 1973, the early-music movement was often equated with dry playing and odd sounds from obdurate period instruments. On Thursday night, while watching and listening to the group in a delightfully engaging concert at Zankel Hall, it was striking how much freedom this movement now affords.</p>
        <p>An early-music ensemble like the academy, although established, still has to consider certain existential parameters: what is its philosophy toward the music it is making? How does it play it? What does its presentation say about the music and the group? Compare the musicians with the players in a standard orchestra, whose task is too often simply to put on penguin suits and execute the works without the same kind of exploration of their musical identities.</p>
        <p>The academy certainly showed off a vibrant personality on this stop on its first album tour under Mr. Hogwood's successor, the gifted keyboard player Richard Egarr. The album, which came out in February, is devoted to Handel's Concerti Grossi (Op. 3), a collection of music both scintillating and disparate.</p>
        <p>Three of these pieces were woven through a concert that also offered ''Water Music'' suites by Handel (some quieter, perhaps deservedly less-known sections of his famous work) and Telemann (''Hamburger Ebb und Fluth''), also represented by a concerto in E minor that contrasted the timbres of dusky flute and piping recorder.</p>
        <p>The music was not so much great as eminently entertaining. If this was water music, it was alive with glints of sunlight and recorder off the waves, the undercurrent of a jolly bassoon, the fresh breeze of two wonderful woody oboes. Beautifully balanced, playing fluidly and turning on a dime, the players brought alive each of Telemann's tableaus or contrasted his linearity with Handel's lithe muscularity.</p>
        <p>One memorable moment came between the two movements of the Concerto Grosso (Op. 3, No. 6), in which the two most distinctive period instruments, the harpsichord and the long-necked, lutelike theorbo, were pulled from the fabric of the ensemble like fine threads in a duo improvisation by Mr. Egarr and William Carter.</p>
        <p>Rife with small and wonderful detail, the concert demonstrated anew that the secret of making classical music accessible lies not in surrounding it with lectures and program notes but simply in presenting it with a point of view, and very well.</p>

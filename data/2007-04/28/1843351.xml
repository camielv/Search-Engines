        <p>Federal reports that criticized conditions at Colorado veterans' nursing homes have caused an outcry here. Legislators have scrambled to allocate new money to the homes, the state agency that operates them has promised improvements and the Veterans Affairs Department moved up its annual inspection of a home suffering from especially serious disrepair.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, officials from the V.A. inspected that home, the Homelake state veterans center, which was reported to be in such poor shape that half of its cottages were inaccessible to disabled residents. The department's reports also documented a string of deficiencies at other state-operated veterans' nursing homes across Colorado, including one where many veterans had contracted bedsores.</p>

        <p>Federal reports that criticized conditions at Colorado veterans' nursing homes have caused an outcry here. Legislators have scrambled to allocate new money to the homes, the state agency that operates them has promised improvements and the Veterans Affairs Department moved up its annual inspection of a home suffering from especially serious disrepair.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, officials from the V.A. inspected that home, the Homelake state veterans center, which was reported to be in such poor shape that half of its cottages were inaccessible to disabled residents. The department's reports also documented a string of deficiencies at other state-operated veterans' nursing homes across Colorado, including one where many veterans had contracted bedsores.</p>
        <p>''Previously, I'm not sure what level of attention was there,'' said Viki Manley, the director of the Colorado office of state and veterans nursing homes, which runs the facilities.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, this has been going on for years, and it's taking us some time to catch up,'' said Ms. Manley, who took over as director earlier this year. ''It's time to take a comprehensive look at everything we do.''</p>
        <p>Colorado has five nursing homes for veterans scattered through the state. Though they are overseen by the federal veterans' department, which supplements the health care of the roughly 400 veterans living in them, the state is charged with their daily operation.</p>
        <p>The Veterans Affairs Department survey reports, which focused largely on patient care and home upkeep, were compiled last year and were first reported by The Associated Press. At one home, in Rifle, the department found there had been an inadequate follow-up investigation when one resident died after a fall. At another home, the Walsenburg state veterans' nursing home, 42 residents had developed bedsores since the previous annual report was conducted there, the reports found.</p>
        <p>The most notable shortcomings, however, were at Homelake, a facility that dates to the 1890s, when it served as a home for Civil War veterans.</p>
        <p>According to the reports, Homelake's antiquated buildings suffered from safety and maintenance deficiencies, including exposed hazardous materials and problems with water and sanitary lines. Several of Homelake's buildings have been closed because of structural concerns, the report stated.</p>
        <p>''There have been problems for several years, and I think it's mostly because of funding,'' said Paul Sherbo, a Veterans Affairs Department spokesman. ''When we see these problems, we try and work with the state to resolve them. We're always concerned with veterans' care.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Manley said that preliminary findings from the inspection emphasized longstanding concerns with the rundown state of Homelake's buildings and residential cottages and some administrative issues, but no pervasive problems with the overall quality of care.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherbo declined to comment on the inspection's results because they are still in draft form. The completed report from the Homelake inspection is expected in May. Ralph Bozella, chairman of the state and veterans nursing home commission, which helps oversee the facilities, said that he was pleased by the care provided by the staffs at the facilities but that the state had neglected proper maintenance of the homes for far too long.</p>
        <p>''We've known this was going on for a while,'' Mr. Bozella said. ''I have testified, written letters, saying you guys have got to do something, calling for the state to put money into the homes.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Manley agreed with Mr. Bozella's assertion.</p>
        <p>''We lacked in getting the issue moved up in the eyes of the General Assembly, who could get us the money we needed,'' she said. ''There wasn't, perhaps, the communication in the past to raise the proper alarms.''</p>
        <p>But the fallout from the reports has already changed the political landscape. Gov. Bill Ritter Jr., a Democrat, recently signed two pieces of legislation that will increase oversight of the homes, making the existing state and veterans nursing home commission a permanent body, and also creating local advisory boards in the communities where the nursing homes are located.</p>
        <p>The legislature has allocated an additional $917,000 from the state budget to pay for repairs at Homelake, and Governor Ritter is expected to sign off on the budget next week. After he does, Mr. Bozella said, the federal veterans' department will provide an additional $2.2 million in matching money.</p>
        <p>Other states are also facing pressure over substandard conditions at veterans' nursing homes.</p>
        <p>In February, the Department of Justice began investigating conditions at two state nursing homes for veterans in Tennessee. Also in February, Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota created a commission to examine chronic problems with veterans nursing homes in that state following a series of investigations and three deaths at a Minneapolis home.</p>
        <p>The director of the Arizona Department of Veterans Services resigned in March after state health investigators discovered a litany of violations at a veterans' nursing home in Phoenix, including patients who were left in soiled underwear and covered in bodily fluids that had leaked from medical devices.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial holds that Institute of Medicine has proposed new standards for snack foods in schools that could help wean young people off junk foods, but it may be hard to wean school districts from revenues they receive from snack food vendors; maintains that Congress could assist by mandating standards</p>

        <p>We'll leave it to the ethicists to determine whether Shrek, an animated ogre who is hugely popular with the preteen and preschool set, is too hobbled with conflicts of interest to serve as a health adviser to his fans. Shrek is appearing in public service ads urging youngsters to exercise as an antidote to the worsening childhood obesity epidemic. Yet he is also the star of a soon-to-open sequel whose image is being used to promote all sorts of candies, cookies, soft drinks, sugary cereals and other high-calorie ''junk foods.''</p>
        <p>That sure does send a mixed message to the kiddies. But perhaps Shrek can rationalize his dual role by noting that if you eat the junk food he promotes, you will become as stout and potbellied as he is and will really, really have to exercise to take off the excess pounds.</p>

        <p>The more important development for childhood nutrition may be a new set of standards for snack foods in schools just proposed by the Institute of Medicine, a unit of the National Academy of Sciences. Schools are already required to meet some nutritional standards for the meals they serve under federally subsidized programs. But the array of soft drinks, candies, cakes, chips and other junk foods that students gorge on from vending machines and school stores are a nutritional wasteland, with lots of calories but dubious health value.</p>
        <p>The institute, at the request of Congress, has now developed standards for foods that are not already subject to the rules for federally subsidized programs. The standards promote the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and other healthy foods, while limiting calories, saturated fat, added sugars and other menaces to health or waistlines. They effectively rule out high-calorie, low-nutrient snacks and beverages, exile vending machines for even many acceptable snacks to lightly traveled areas, and ban marketing symbols on the machines (no Shreks allowed).</p>
        <p>Although the standards could help wean young people off junk foods and steer them toward healthy lifetime eating habits, it may be hard to wean school districts from the revenues they receive from snack food vendors. Congress could assist by mandating the standards.</p>

        <p>An eerie calm slipped over Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, on Friday for the first time in a month.</p>
        <p>After intense combat that killed more than 1,000 people, insurgents melted back into the broken city, and hundreds of families began to return home.</p>
        <p>The transitional Somali government claimed victory, saying that its troops had vanquished the insurgency and that peace and prosperity were just around the corner. ''The fighting in Mogadishu is over,'' said Abdikarim Farah, Somalia's ambassador to Ethiopia, at a news conference in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.</p>
        <p>''Mogadishu was once called the Pearl of the Indian Ocean,'' he said. ''God willing, it will come to deserve that name again.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, though, the city hardly looked like a pearl. Bodies covered with flies littered the streets, and many buildings were still smoking. Looters picked through the Coca-Cola factory, where a year's supply of sugar was stolen.</p>
        <p>In the past month the people of Mogadishu have endured some of the heaviest combat ever fought in the city, which like the rest of Somalia has gone 16 years without a functioning government.</p>
        <p>Much of the fighting was artillery exchanges between Ethiopian-led forces backing the transitional government and insurgents connected to the Islamist movement that was recently ousted from power.</p>
        <p>Civilians were caught in the cross-fire, and United Nations officials estimate that more than 350,000 people fled.</p>
        <p>On Friday a trickle of them returned to inspect charred homes and bullet-pocked streets. The United Nations has ambitious plans to roll a convoy of trucks into Mogadishu and the surrounding area to feed hundreds of thousands of people. The first food shipment arrived Thursday.</p>
        <p>But the insurgency is probably not over.</p>
        <p>Instead, it seems, the insurgents have simply absorbed the same lesson that the Islamist militias learned in December when the conflict started: that undisciplined bands of young fighters are no match for better trained, better equipped Ethiopian soldiers.</p>
        <p>''Their snipers were killing us left and right,'' said Mohammed Isse, 45, a gunman who left an Islamist militia to join an insurgent group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Isse estimated that Ethiopian soldiers had killed more than 800 insurgents. Still, he was unbowed. ''We're just going to switch tactics,'' he said. ''We're thinking suicide bombs, kidnappings and attacks on government hotels.''</p>
        <p>''Stuff like that,'' he added.</p>

        <p>Correction to April 26 article about football player Calvin Johnson concerns quotation by his father</p>
      </abstract>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Because of an editing error, a sports article on Thursday about receiver Calvin Johnson on the eve of the N.F.L. draft misattributed a quotation about the influence of his family's values on Johnson. It was Johnson's father, Calvin Sr. -- not Johnson himself -- who said the family ''wouldn't tolerate a lot of being foolish.'' The article also referred imprecisely to Johnson's leaping ability. He performed an 11-foot-7-inch standing long jump, not just a long jump.</p>

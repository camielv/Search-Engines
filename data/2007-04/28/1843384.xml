        <p>Something in the silver Mercedes sport utility vehicle was potentially dangerous, at least if the police lieutenant's radiation detector was any guide. The device's alarm went off as the lieutenant, who works with the Police Department's counterterrorism unit, was driving to work yesterday around 8 a.m., heading west on the Belt Parkway in Brooklyn near Cropsey Avenue.</p>
        <p>The device, a RadEye Pager, sounds its alarm when it detects higher than normal levels of radiation nearby. The police have about 900 RadEye Pagers in use citywide, all for counterterrorism purposes.</p>

        <p>Something in the silver Mercedes sport utility vehicle was potentially dangerous, at least if the police lieutenant's radiation detector was any guide. The device's alarm went off as the lieutenant, who works with the Police Department's counterterrorism unit, was driving to work yesterday around 8 a.m., heading west on the Belt Parkway in Brooklyn near Cropsey Avenue.</p>
        <p>The device, a RadEye Pager, sounds its alarm when it detects higher than normal levels of radiation nearby. The police have about 900 RadEye Pagers in use citywide, all for counterterrorism purposes.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the lieutenant pointed his RadEye Pager this way and that, and determined that the radiation was coming from the silver Mercedes beside him. He alerted highway officers, who pulled the Mercedes over.</p>
        <p>The driver, Syed M. Haider, popped the trunk, and inside was a small rectangular device known as a Troxler Gauge. The gauge, a legal construction device, measures asphalt, concrete and soil density using low-level radioactive isotopes, which happened to set off the pager's alarm. To be legally transported, though, a Troxler must be inside a shielded container, and Mr. Haider's Troxler was not.</p>
        <p>In any event, his brother, Syed W. Haider, who owns Haider Engineering in Baldwin, in Nassau County, arrived soon with the proper container, and into it the Troxler went.</p>
        <p>The driver and the company were issued six summonses, a law enforcement official said. The official said the level of radioactivity was low and would not be a health risk.</p>
        <p>''There isn't an alarm that does not have to be investigated,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The company's owner said that his brother had been in a rush yesterday and that properly packing the Troxler slipped his mind. ''It's a simple matter of forgetting,'' the brother said. ''We showed up with the container, and everything is O.K.''</p>

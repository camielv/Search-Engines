        <p>Democratic leaders in Congress are planning a special ceremony on Tuesday afternoon to send President Bush a bill that sets timetables for troop withdrawal from Iraq.</p>
        <p>The timing is no accident. It comes on the fourth anniversary of the day Mr. Bush stood on an aircraft carrier under the banner ''Mission Accomplished'' and declared that major combat operations in Iraq had ended.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' ceremony, featuring the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is part of the elaborate political theater at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue surrounding the Iraq spending bill, which is destined to produce only the second veto of Mr. Bush's presidency.</p>
        <p>But with Mr. Bush planning to spend Tuesday in Florida talking with military commanders, the White House was being coy on Monday about what kind of theatrics of his own -- if any -- he might stage. Democrats, however, said they expected the veto to come Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's spokesman, Tony Snow, said, ''We'll make clear what we intend and how we intend to do it at the proper time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden after meeting with leaders of the European Union, expressed optimism that the two sides could reach a compromise after his veto, which Democrats concede they will not be able to override.</p>
        <p>''I believe that there's a lot of Democrats that understand that we need to get the money to the troops as soon as possible,'' he said, ''and so I'm optimistic we can get something done in a positive way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush first exercised his veto last year, when the Republican-controlled Congress sent him a bill to expand federal financing for embryonic stem cell research. On that occasion, the president spoke at the White House surrounded by so-called ''snowflake babies,'' those born from frozen embryos and then adopted.</p>
        <p>The spending bill veto would be the first since Democrats took control of Congress this year and would open a new chapter in the confrontation between the legislative and executive branches over the Iraq war. The path to legislation the president might sign remained unclear on Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has asked Congressional leaders to meet at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the legislation. Democrats have already been considering possible alternatives.</p>
        <p>One leading option, put forth by Representative John P. Murtha, Democrat of Pennsylvania, is to pass a measure that includes benchmarks for the Iraqis to advance on establishing a stable government and reconciling ethnic differences.</p>
        <p>That proposal would not include timetables for troop withdrawal -- a move that would anger some in the party's liberal wing who believe voters gave them a mandate last election to force Mr. Bush to end the war.</p>
        <p>''These new members are upset,'' Mr. Murtha said. ''They were sent here to stop the war. This is a very delicate thing that we're working with.''</p>
        <p>The bill will be sent to the White House via a legislative courier after Tuesday afternoon's ceremony. After the expected presidential veto, the legislation would return to the House for consideration. If the House fails to override the veto, with a two-thirds vote, the legislation is considered dead and the Senate would not try to override the veto.</p>
        <p>Democratic leaders delivered a final argument on Monday for Mr. Bush to sign the bill.</p>
        <p>''We ask him again to listen to the American people and his own military experts,'' Mr. Reid said on the Senate floor. ''We ask that he finally summon the courage to admit his mistakes and take the steps we propose to begin to heal the grave wounds he has caused.''</p>

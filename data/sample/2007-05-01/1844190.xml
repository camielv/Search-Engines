        <p>8 P.M. (TCM) BRANDO -- ''Before Brando, actors acted,'' says Michael Winner, who directed Marlon Brando in ''The Nightcomers.'' ''After Brando, they behaved. That is the difference -- an extraordinary effect on the history of drama and the history of movies.'' This two-part documentary tries to unlock the enigma of Brando (above, in ''The Wild One,'' from 1953) through interviews with everyone from his former high school classmates to the likes of Al Pacino, Martin Scorsese, Jon Voight, Jane Fonda, Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper. It also includes film of Brando onstage and on screen, from ''Truckline Café,'' which first earned him recognition on Broadway, through ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' which catapulted him over the top, with stops at ''Julius Caesar,'' in which he proved he could enunciate; ''The Godfather,'' his signature work; and the intimate ''Last Tango in Paris.''</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- Tonight Jon Bon Jovi (whose hair could rival Sanjaya's anytime) helps the remaining finalists find their inner rocker. Tomorrow his band, Bon Jovi, performs ''Make a Memory'' from its new album, ''Lost Highway,'' to be released on June 19. And then two -- count 'em, two -- contestants go home.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (My Network TV) AMERICA'S TRASHIEST WEDDINGS -- In the so-bad-it's-good category, a special in which five couples rehash their wedding days, stag nights and in-law troubles. It's not pretty.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Food Network) WEDDING CAKE SURPRISE -- Five cake decorators swirl on the frosting for a chance to win $10,000 and have their cake displayed at a wedding (a respectable one).</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (NBC) LAW &amp; ORDER: CRIMINAL INTENT -- An astronaut's affair with a married rocket man (Tate Donovan) leaves her dead in their hotel.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) DANCING WITH THE STARS -- Results from last night's ballroom blitz.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13, 49) THE MORMONS -- Part 2 of this documentary about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Sundance Channel) BIG IDEAS FOR A SMALL PLANET -- Dennis Wilde, a ''green-minded'' developer; Trey Taylor, right, who has developed an underwater turbine system; and Heather Flores, a guerrilla gardener, talk about rethinking urban life.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (My Network TV) BODY DOUBLES: INTERNATIONAL TWINS SEARCH -- Looks times two: siblings compete for the title of ''The Most Beautiful Twins in the World.''</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (National Geographic) FINAL REPORT: CLINTON IMPEACHMENT -- An examination of whether President Bill Clinton's actions warranted the series of events they unleashed.</p>
        <p>11:35 P.M. (NBC) THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO -- Dr. Phil McGraw and Rove McManus, the Australian variety show host, are guests. But the evening's big coup is Patti Smith, right, who performs from her latest album, ''Twelve.''</p>

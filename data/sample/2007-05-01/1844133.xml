        <p>BLAY--Freda Robinson, 86, died on April 27, after a brief illness. Predeceasing her was her beloved husband John S. Blay and her sister Ruth Joseph. Born in Syracuse, NY to the late Harry and Anna Rubenstein, she was a graduate of Syracuse University College of Fine Arts. Professionally known as Freda Robinson, she was Vice President of Parfums Nina Ricci Paris from 1962-1983 and a consultant to the company until 1993. After retiring she became an officer on the Board of Directors for the New York City chapter of the Alzheimers Association. As in her life, Freda's last weeks were filled with grace, dignity and thoughtfulness for her friends and relatives. All will miss her strength and delicacy but none more than her beloved Heidi, Kate and John Zdrojeski. Contributions in her memory may be made to the Alzheimers Association, New York City chapter, 360 Lexington Avenue, NY 10017 and Cabrini Hospice, 227 East 19th Street, NY 10003.

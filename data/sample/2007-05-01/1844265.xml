        <p>Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia closed a loophole Monday in the state's gun laws that allowed a mentally disturbed Virginia Tech student to buy the guns used in a shooting rampage that left 33 dead at the university on April 16.</p>
        <p>The governor issued an executive order intended to prohibit the sale of guns to anyone found to be dangerous and forced to undergo involuntary mental health treatment. Under the order, their names would be included a database of people banned from buying guns.</p>
        <p>In December 2005, a Virginia judge directed Seung-Hui Cho, the gunman in the massacre, to undergo outpatient treatment. But because Mr. Cho was treated as an outpatient, Virginia did not send his name to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.</p>
        <p>Only 22 states submit any mental health records to the federal database. Federal gun laws depend on the states for enforcement, and the failure of Virginia to flag Mr. Cho has raised growing questions about the adequacy of background checks to scrutinize potential gun buyers.</p>
        <p>The governor said the database ''should include any determination that someone is mentally ill and so dangerous to himself or others as to warrant involuntary treatment.''</p>
        <p>The governor also instructed the State Police to request orders for involuntary inpatient care and involuntary outpatient care from district courts and to include that information in the database.</p>
        <p>''We realized that this is something we can fix right now and that we needn't wait to fix it,'' Mr. Kaine said in a news conference.</p>
        <p>He added that he hoped his move would encourage other states to tighten their mental health restrictions on gun buyers.</p>
        <p>''We were all very surprised to find that despite a federal prohibition on purchase of weapons by the mentally ill that dates back to the 1960s,'' Mr. Kaine said, ''the majority of states report no data on mental health adjudications in the national database.''</p>
        <p>Even in states with these stricter mental health restrictions, gun buyers can sidestep background checks by obtaining firearms from a private seller or at a gun show from a ''private'' individual or ''collector.''</p>
        <p>Those purchases account for about half of the guns sold in the United States each year. Efforts by Virginia lawmakers to close this gun-show loophole have been repeatedly blocked by gun-rights advocates.</p>

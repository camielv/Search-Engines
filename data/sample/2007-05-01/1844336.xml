        <p>Three New Jersey counties -- Camden, Gloucester and Mercer -- were added yesterday to President Bush's disaster declaration in regard to the northeaster of April 15. Last week, the president declared disaster areas in Bergen, Burlington, Essex, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties, with Hudson, Middlesex and Morris added on Saturday. Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey had requested that the entire state receive the designation, which gives residents access to federal aid. The president also allowed for infrastructure repairs to municipalities in 11 counties.</p>

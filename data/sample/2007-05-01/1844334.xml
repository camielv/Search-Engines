        <p>A Brooklyn man who was arrested Sunday on drunken-driving charges near the scene of a hit-and-run accident that killed a 13-year-old boy riding a bicycle was charged yesterday with vehicular manslaughter, the police said. They said that the boy, Anthony Delgado of Brooklyn, was struck just after midnight on Sunday at the intersection of Palmetto Street and Central Avenue in Bushwick. The man, Melvin Morales, 34, was arrested a short time later, after being stopped for a reason unconnected to the hit and run, the police said. Investigators said that evidence on his sport utility vehicle linked it to the hit and run, and that a surveillance camera had captured images that would provide evidence against Mr. Morales.</p>

        <p>The cross-examination of a crucial witness at the trial of Conrad M. Black grew heated on Monday when a defense lawyer attempted to portray the witness as forgetful or inept.</p>
        <p>In response, the witness, Marie-José Kravis, a former director of Mr. Black's company, Hollinger International, maintained that she and other directors were misled about millions of dollars in payments Mr. Black and other executives received.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kravis was a member of the audit committee at Hollinger, the newspaper company Mr. Black founded, from 1998 to 2001, the period in which he and three colleagues are accused of paying themselves over $60 million in unauthorized bonuses.</p>
        <p>She was one of the three audit committee members -- all of whom are to testify at the fraud trial that began last month. Her testimony is notable because of her prominence both as a director of several major companies and as a member of New York society. Her husband, Henry R. Kravis, is a founder of the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, had socialized with the Kravises, and Mrs. Kravis served as a co-host of a book party for Mr. Black in 2003, just as accusations of impropriety surfaced.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kravis, who served on the board from 1996 until 2003, had maintained a low-profile role as the scandal at Hollinger unfolded. As a prosecution witness in the case against Mr. Black and three former associates, Jack A. Boultbee, Mark S. Kipnis and Peter Y. Atkinson, Mrs. Kravis said last week that she had missed several references to the contentious payments in various securities filings that she had approved.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Black's lawyer, Edward Greenspan, ran though a series of drafts and final documents signed by Mrs. Kravis and other directors that contained largely identical paragraphs describing payments made to Mr. Black and the other executives. In all, Mr. Greenspan presented 11 documents from 2000 to 2003 that he said were sent to Mrs. Kravis in her role on the audit committee and board.</p>
        <p>The prosecution's case rests on the claim that the payments were presented to the audit committee and board under the fraudulent pretense that the buyers of newspapers from the company had demanded that payments be made to the individuals rather than the company -- and that the money should have gone to Hollinger.</p>
        <p>In his cross-examination, Mr. Greenspan, a renowned defense lawyer in Canada, sought to show that Mrs. Kravis had several chances to ask Mr. Black or other executives about the payments but never did.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Greenspan splashed the relevant paragraphs on a big screen in the courtroom, Mrs. Kravis said she had either missed the paragraph in question or could not remember seeing it. ''We just can't rely on your memory for anything, can we?'' Mr. Greenspan asked Mrs. Kravis.</p>
        <p>''That's not correct,'' she replied.</p>
        <p>At another point, Mr. Greenspan asked: ''You don't have anything against footnotes, do you?''</p>
        <p>''No,'' Mrs. Kravis replied.</p>
        <p>Later, she testified that questions were not asked because some transactions brought before the committee were presented as noncompetition agreements rather than as related-party transactions, which might have drawn closer scrutiny.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan also pointed out that Hollinger International had adopted a charter for its audit committee in 1999, which, among other things, required financial literacy, independence from the company for each member and a designated expert in ''accounting or financial management.''</p>
        <p>The other two audit committee members were Richard R. Burt, a former ambassador, who testified last week; and James R. Thompson, a lawyer and former governor of Illinois. Mr. Thompson is expected to begin his testimony Tuesday. ''As a group we had financial literacy but there was not a financial expert,'' Mrs. Kravis said.</p>
        <p>Their exchanges became mutually exasperating and testy, prompting Judge Amy St. Eve to say: ''Don't talk at the same time and don't argue with the witness.'' Mr. Greenspan paused and said to Mrs. Kravis, ''If you don't do it, I won't do it.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kravis had also given damaging testimony last week about two of the more showy accusations against Mr. Black: that he charged a surprise 60th birthday party for his wife at a chic New York eatery mostly to the company, and that the couple had improperly used the company's Gulfstream jet for a vacation to Bora Bora without covering the full $500,000 expense.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kravis agreed with Mr. Greenspan's assertion that the company had no formal policy about executives' use of the company plane at the time of the Bora Bora trip. She said that in the absence of a policy, ''it was the law'' that the company followed, a statement to which Mr. Greenspan looked puzzled.</p>
        <p>Where the birthday party was concerned, Mr. Greenspan attacked Mrs. Kravis's earlier contention that it did not seem to be a company event by reading off a guest list of numerous media luminaries and business figures in attendance.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kravis confirmed that most of the audit committee's contact with management was with F. David Radler, Mr. Black's former partner, who has pleaded guilty and is expected to testify on the government's behalf.</p>
        <p>Once unhappy shareholders began asking questions in May 2003 about payments and compensation, Mr. Greenspan noted that Mr. Black wrote the audit committee a memo on the subject in response to an e-mail message from Mrs. Kravis relaying her concerns. ''You got what you asked for when you asked Conrad, right Mrs. Kravis?'' Mr. Greenspan asked. ''He did respond, yes.''</p>
        <p>Several months later, in October, Mrs. Kravis wrote Mr. Black a note saying that because K.K.R. was looking at buying regional newspapers in the United States, she was resigning from the board ''to avoid any appearance of conflict.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Black faxed a handwritten note, accepting her resignation with regret and thanking her for her services. ''You will be missed,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 7, 2007, Monday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Tuesday about the fraud trial of Conrad M. Black misspelled the given name of the former director of Mr. Black's company who testified that she and other directors were misled about millions of dollars in payments to Mr. Black and other executives. She was Marie-Josée Kravis, not Marie-José.</p>

        <p>Three men posing as police officers pulled over a vehicle on the New Jersey Turnpike yesterday afternoon, forced the passengers to the ground and stole the car, the state police said. The victims, who were not identified, told the police that three men in a white Ford Explorer pulled alongside their southbound Toyota Avalon near the Alexander Hamilton rest area on the turnpike, held up silver badges on chains around their necks, and motioned for the driver to pull over, said Sgt. Jeanne Hengemuhle, a spokeswoman for the state police. The men pulled into the rest area, where they were forced out of the car and onto the ground. One of the men from the Ford got into the Toyota, which had a New York license plate, DUU-2791, and both cars sped off, the sergeant said.</p>

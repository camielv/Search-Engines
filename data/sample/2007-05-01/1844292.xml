        <p>On a rink filled with the young players who never miss a practice, optional or not, Rangers forward Jaromir Jagr skated around with a big smile.</p>
        <p>Less than 24 hours after the Rangers' 2-1 victory against Buffalo in double overtime in their Eastern Conference playoff series, Jagr could have taken the day off. Most of his over-30 teammates did. But Jagr, 35, chose to work up a sweat with his mostly younger teammates, filling a short practice with a big presence.</p>
        <p>After Sunday's game, Jagr said that he was not overly tired. The game lasted nearly 97 minutes, and Jagr was on the ice for 30 minutes 1 second of it, playing 40 shifts. Jagr's ice time was also affected by the nine penalties called on the Rangers. Penalty-killing is not among his many skills.</p>
        <p>Coach Tom Renney diligently used his whole lineup in order to manage his players' time on the ice.</p>
        <p>''In overtime, you're using four lines,'' Jagr said. ''The first line, it might play a little more often, but without the timeouts, most of the teams play four lines. That's why I wasn't that tired. I'm used to playing a lot more.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers will try to use the confidence boost from their victory at Madison Square Garden to even the series at 2-2 Tuesday. They will be playing in front of the home crowd again, but they will also benefit from the fact that their stars did not carry too heavy a workload Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Sabres are younger than the Rangers and more celebrated for their depth. They play all four of their lines liberally, and each line has players who can score.</p>
        <p>Buffalo Coach Lindy Ruff likes to say that he has three No. 2 lines. He encourages them to play short shifts, so the playing time is distributed evenly. In Game 3, for example, center Daniel Brière logged the most minutes and played the most shifts of any Buffalo forward, with 31:33 in 40 shifts. Adam Mair had the fewest, 14:11 in 19 shifts.</p>
        <p>Sabres forwards averaged a little less than 25 minutes in Game 3. The defensemen averaged about 30.</p>
        <p>Still, at the Sabres' practice Monday at the Garden, none of the regulars participated.</p>
        <p>The Rangers, who rely so heavily on their top two lines, managed similar restraint in playing time, but doing so was not easy. Martin Straka, who centers the second line, played the most of any forward, 30:45, largely because he plays on the first power-play unit and on the penalty kill. Michael Nylander was the only other forward who played longer than Jagr, 30:04. The fourth-line wing Brad Isbister played the least, 9:18 and only 14 shifts. The forwards averaged more than 23 minutes. The defensemen averaged 31.</p>
        <p>''Guys were pretty disciplined with their shift length,'' said Brendan Shanahan, a 38-year-old forward. He did not skate Monday after playing 28:54. ''I wouldn't say there's a big difference between our top six forwards and their top six forwards. Plus, some of the guys on our fourth line are our penalty killers, so they got a lot of ice time with all the penalties we were given.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers' penalty-kill unit leans heavily on the fourth-liners Blair Betts and Jed Ortmeyer, and that duty occupied most of their ice time.</p>
        <p>''I think we were able to get out there in certain situations, maybe create a little momentum as far as some energy, get some hits, give the other lines a little bit of a break,'' Ortmeyer said.</p>
        <p>Renney has tinkered with that fourth line in this series. He inserted Isbister after Game 1, benched Ortmeyer for a game and has now benched Ryan Hollweg. Renney likes Isbister's straight-ahead mentality, and his work digging pucks out of the corner. Ortmeyer adds speed. Betts has the most skill and had some scoring opportunities in Game 3.</p>
        <p>''They pay attention to our game plan,'' Renney said of the fourth line. ''Lots of nights, it's an example of how we want to do things. You can use that to illustrate what we're looking for. It's just dogged determination to do the right things and sort of manage the game and what they're all about as best they can.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Renney repeatedly used his fourth line during overtime.</p>
        <p>And players like Jagr reaped the benefits.</p>
        <p>''The fresher team is going to win the series,'' Jagr said. ''Hopefully the victory gives us enough confidence, enough energy, and our fans are going to be able to give us enough energy to tie the series.''</p>

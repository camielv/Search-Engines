        <p>SOMEBODY keeps knocking Jesus off his pedestal outside St. Martin of Tours Church in the Bronx.

        <p>Folks in the Crotona neighborhood are reeling, too. This statue has been a backdrop to wedding, baptism and first communion photos for generations.

        <p>SOMEBODY keeps knocking Jesus off his pedestal outside St. Martin of Tours Church in the Bronx. This time, vandals streaked the face with black marker and wrote ''devil'' and ''666,'' and the half-smashed statue spent most of last week propped up against the pedestal as if recovering from a dizzy spell.</p>
        <p>Folks in the Crotona neighborhood are reeling, too. This statue has been a backdrop to wedding, baptism and first communion photos for generations. It is the site of countless silent prayers or rapid signs of the cross for passers-by. Everyone insists the statue will reclaim its rightful place in their hearts and neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Just how is more complicated.</p>
        <p>Several parishioners -- no doubt speaking from experience with robberies at homes they now secure with bars, chains and alarms -- suggested putting Jesus on lockdown.</p>
        <p>''You are not going to put my Jesus in a cage!'' said the Rev. John Flynn, the pastor of the Roman Catholic parish. ''Don't you dare think that. He has got to be out there by himself. We are not going to hide him.''</p>
        <p>On Good Friday evening, vandals pried the fiberglass statue off its pedestal, tossing it and a knife onto the dirt. Parishioners cleaned it off and glued it back on the pedestal. On April 23, the statue was knocked down, defaced and thrown face down, its right shoulder smashed and its red robes chipped.</p>
        <p>Nancy Padilla and some friends were at a prayer meeting when a parishioner they know only as El Mexicanito -- ''the Little Mexican Guy'' -- burst in to say that the statue had been robbed.</p>
        <p>''Everyone rushed outside,'' she said. ''We looked over the wall and there it was. That's when we saw the arm was broken. I told El Mexicanito to get some water to wash it. But the three sixes did not come out. Demons must have done this.''</p>
        <p>Actually, there are whispers in the neighborhood that a group of young men who play handball and smoke and sell whatever they can in a nearby park may know more than a little about the crime. Some of them have ''666'' tattoos, said one person who saw them often in the park. Often, that is, until last week, when they made themselves scarce.</p>
        <p>The police are investigating. People are praying, and painting. By Sunday, volunteers had restored the statue. And they glued it down, yet again.</p>
        <p>Delia Mojica, the director of religious education at the parish, passed by the statue a few days ago, carrying a book titled ''God's Law Guides Us.'' Obviously, somebody had differed. Twice.</p>
        <p>''How could someone be so mean?'' she wondered. ''I don't think it was somebody in their right mind.''</p>
        <p>A man sidled up to her, peered over the top of his glasses and shook his head.</p>
        <p>''They need to make a cage,'' he said. ''With glass.''</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of April 26 article about New Jersey Schools Construction Corporation; 56 projects have been completed in past five years; $5 billion was not spent on land purchases and planning costs alone</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Thursday about a reduction in the number of schools that the New Jersey Schools Construction Corporation says it can build or rehabilitate with the money it has on hand referred incorrectly to the status of the agency's previous projects and to their costs. Fifty-six -- not zero -- projects have been completed in the past five years, including 30 new schools and 26 major renovations. The more than $5 billion spent so far includes $1.25 billion for these projects as well as land acquisition and planning for others; the $5 billion was not spent on land purchases and planning costs alone.</p>

        <p>The Democrats' debate last week offered a prime site for presidential hopefuls to promote their ideas, credentials and, most important, affection for Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina.</p>
        <p>Few endorsements have been as coveted as that of Mr. Clyburn, the House majority whip, African-American leader and prominent figure in an early primary state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clyburn says he is hesitant to endorse anyone for fear that it will drive the other candidates away from the state. But that did not stop the groveling on Thursday as he made his pre-debate rounds at South Carolina State University and on Friday at his annual fish fry in Columbia, an event that all the major Democratic candidates attended (in Clyburn lapel stickers).</p>
        <p>When asked whether any candidates had called him on his birthday, Mr. Clyburn said no, and he was not happy about it. He was kidding, presumably. But they will all have another chance on July 21.</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Oscar Wilde's short story ''Lord Arthur Savile's Crime'' is a clever mystery, written to indict the fate industry -- the palmists, spiritualists and telepathists, frauds every one of the them, with whom late-19th-century aristocrats seemed so enthralled. The writer Rob Urbinati has used the story, with its dramatic twists and turns, as a blueprint for his latest theatrical effort, ''West Moon Street.'' And while it might seem a bit like taking paprika to Hungary, to lighten up Oscar Wilde he has molded the story into a briskly paced comedy of manners true to its author's greater spirit.</p>
        <p>A production of the Prospect Theater Company, ''West Moon Street'' is simply a delight. Mr. Urbinati and his director, Davis McCallum, see the allegorical potential in Wilde's story. ''Lord Arthur Savile's Crime'' is, in the end, a treatise on the fears that unravel us in the wake of marriage, the equations we make between domestic serenity and death. And ''West Moon Street'' has fun making all the connections.</p>

        <p>Oscar Wilde's short story ''Lord Arthur Savile's Crime'' is a clever mystery, written to indict the fate industry -- the palmists, spiritualists and telepathists, frauds every one of the them, with whom late-19th-century aristocrats seemed so enthralled. The writer Rob Urbinati has used the story, with its dramatic twists and turns, as a blueprint for his latest theatrical effort, ''West Moon Street.'' And while it might seem a bit like taking paprika to Hungary, to lighten up Oscar Wilde he has molded the story into a briskly paced comedy of manners true to its author's greater spirit.</p>
        <p>A production of the Prospect Theater Company, ''West Moon Street'' is simply a delight. Mr. Urbinati and his director, Davis McCallum, see the allegorical potential in Wilde's story. ''Lord Arthur Savile's Crime'' is, in the end, a treatise on the fears that unravel us in the wake of marriage, the equations we make between domestic serenity and death. And ''West Moon Street'' has fun making all the connections.</p>
        <p>In the story, a young Oxford graduate, Lord Arthur, learns from a palm reader at a dinner party near the eve of his wedding that he will be complicit in a murder. Convinced that he must get this killing business out of the way before he marries, Lord Arthur postpones his wedding and sets about trying to determine who he will extinguish.</p>
        <p>''He had lived the delicate and luxurious life of a young man of birth and fortune, a life exquisite in its freedom from sordid care, its beautiful boyish insouciance,'' Wilde writes of Arthur, processing the news. ''And now for the first time he became conscious of the terrible mystery of Destiny, of the awful meaning of Doom.''</p>
        <p>David Ruffin does a sly, wonderful job mining Lord Arthur for all the boyish insouciance Wilde intended him to embody so that we see exactly what it is he'll have to sacrifice. And Mr. Ruffin is surrounded by a cast of equally skilled comic performers, among them, Glenn Peters who plays, in drag, the doddering old aunt whom Lord Arthur sets out to eliminate, and Jocelyn Greene as a consummate drawing room flibbertigibbet -- grating giggle and all. ''West Moon Street'' is the kind of play at which it is virtually impossible to have a gloomy time.</p>
        <p>''West Moon Street'' continues through May 20 at the Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101.</p>

        <p>CESSNA DELIVERS VERY LIGHT JET -- As the very light jet market stirs to life, the Cessna Aircraft Company delivered its first retail Citation Mustang jet last week to Goode Ski Technologies. Goode is currently flying a Cessna 310 twin-engine piston propeller aircraft, and says it bought the Mustang to make it easier to travel to ski locations to test its products. Cessna already has two Mustangs flying for marketing purposes. The $2.5 million, four-passenger Mustang is the latest model of a very light jet to enter commercial service. Eclipse Aviation recently delivered three of its Eclipse 500 very light jets to DayJet, a company that plans to begin on-demand air-taxi service in June and has ordered 239 of the aircraft. Competitors producing very light jets, which are sometimes called microjets, include Adam Aircraft, Honda, Embraer and Piper. A new online magazine, www.verylightjets.com, is devoted exclusively to the new aircraft.</p>
        <p>NEW ORLEANS LOSES CONVENTION -- The National Business Aviation Association moved its 2008 convention to Orlando, Fla., from New Orleans because Lakefront Airport in New Orleans, severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, ''does not appear to be coming back as fast as other parts of the city,'' said Ed Bolen, the trade group's president. The group, which draws more than 30,000 participants to its annual meetings, requires both large exhibition and meeting spaces and extensive nearby airport space for acres of displays of business aircraft. In 2005, the group was forced to hurriedly relocate its convention to Orlando from New Orleans; the hurricane hit a few weeks before the gathering was scheduled to take place. This year's convention is in Atlanta in October. Despite the loss of the business aviation event, New Orleans convention officials say business is slowly recovering. In March, the American College of Cardiology annual meeting drew 30,000 attendees, the largest convention in New Orleans since Katrina.</p>
        <p>ENTERTAINMENT ON DELTA -- Delta Air Lines is continuing to improve its in-flight entertainment, which is usually a fairly neglected feature on major airlines' domestic routes. On domestic flights over four hours, and in international premium cabins, Delta is now offering an HBO channel on personal seat-back monitors with on-demand series, movies and other HBO programming. The channel, which is in addition to the airline's current on-demand programming, is available free to first-class domestic and business-class international customers, and at $5 a feature film and $2 for other television programs in coach cabins equipped with the seat-back monitors.</p>
        <p>ACCOMMODATING THE A380 -- The first commercial flight of an Airbus A380 superjumbo jet is scheduled for late this year by Singapore Airlines, though it is not clear yet when the first commercial A380 service to any airport in the United States will begin. The Government Accountability Office issued a 72-page report last week on potential safety and capacity issues in accommodating the 500- to 853-seat plane at the 18 domestic airports that are spending a total of nearly $1 billion on runway, taxiway and terminal modifications. While a big-capacity aircraft can reduce some congestion in carrying so many passengers at once, the size of the plane -- it has a wingspan of 262 feet -- could also reduce the number of flights that airports can handle. That is because of the need to maintain extra runway and taxiway separation between A380s and other aircraft, says the report, which is available at www.gao.gov/docsearch/repandtest.html.</p>
        <p>SUMMER CROWDS -- Airport congestion will only become worse when the summer peak travel season arrives. According to eSkyGuide, the online flight directory produced by American Express, the average number of scheduled domestic airline flights during June, July and August is up 2.1 percent, to a weekly average of 199,420 over last summer. Within that number, flights by low-cost carriers rose 8.7 percent to an average of 38,399 a week. International flights are up 2.4 percent over last summer, to an average of 28,077 a week.</p>

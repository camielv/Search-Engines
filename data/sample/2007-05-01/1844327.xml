      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of April 28 article about plans by New Jersey Gov Jon S Corzine to leave hospital early</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Saturday about plans by the injured New Jersey governor, Jon S. Corzine, to leave a Camden hospital early this week and continue his recovery at Drumthwacket, the governor's mansion in Princeton, gave an erroneous figure in some copies for the estimated value of his assets, as reported in a 2005 financial disclosure form for the United States Senate, where he served before being elected governor. He said his assets were worth up to $261 million, not up to $61 million. An article about Governor Corzine's discharge from the hospital yesterday appears today on Page B1.</p>

        <p>KRAMER--George P., 80, died at home on April 27, 2007. He was born in Holyoke, MA, graduated with the class of 1950 from Harvard College, and received his LLB in 1953 from the Harvard Law School. At Harvard, he was an editor of The Crimson and a member of the Signet Society. He served as a lieutenant in the USN. As a young lawyer at Watson and Leavenworth, he developed an interest in trademark law and was recognized as an authority in the field; he was senior counsel at Hunton and Williams when he died. He served as Secretary of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York and, later, on its Executive Committee. In 1971, he accompanied the U.S. Antarctic Policy Group South Pole Expedition and planted an anniversary-year flag of the Bar Association at the Pole. After college, George established the Caleb Cheeshahteamuck 1665 Fund at Harvard in memory of its first Native American student. He was the longest serving Secretary of the Harvard Club of New York and a trustee of Hancock Shaker Village. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, his daughter, Alice Truax, his sons, Hawley and Charles Truax, his daughters-in-law, Jane Thrailkill and Julie Truax, and his grandchildren, Olivia, Naomi, and George. A memorial service will take place on May 4 at 5pm at the Union Church in Tyringham, MA. On Sunday, May 6, friends may call at the family apartment in NYC between 5 and 8pm. Contributions in George's memory may be made to Hancock Shaker Village, PO Box 297, Pittsfield, MA, 01202 or to Cabrini Hospice, 227 East 19th Street, NY, NY 10003.</p>

        <p>New Yorkers who moved to Staten Island to escape congestion and pollution will be disappointed to hear that while air quality deteriorated in all five boroughs over the past year, it is worst in Staten Island, according to the eighth annual air pollution report by the American Lung Association. The report, which is scheduled to be released today, found that ozone pollution -- or smog -- is highest on Staten Island. And particle pollution, usually known as soot, has become substantially worse there, as well as in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Louise A. Vetter, chief executive of the American Lung Association of the City of New York, said that among the factors that contribute to Staten Island's pollution are the heavy volume of vehicular traffic and diesel exhaust from ferries and barges in New York Harbor. Prevailing winds and other meteorological phenomena may also cause pollution from other states to hover over Staten Island, Ms. Vetter said.</p>

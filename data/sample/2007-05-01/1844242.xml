        <p>Campaign strategies, endorsements, advertising content and hairdo management. Many factors can influence a political race, and every handicapper has an equation for predicting. Since the late 1980s, a group of psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania has had a system based on a single factor: optimism.</p>
        <p>The researchers, by analyzing stump speeches, have found that the most optimistic candidate usually wins, taking more than 80 percent of the presidential elections since 1900.</p>
        <p>The system is no oracle. It picked Michael S. Dukakis over George Bush in 1988.</p>
        <p>This year, the analysis, led by Andrew Rosenthal, Prateek Sharma and Martin Seligman, found a clear front-runner, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. Rudolph W. Giuliani brought up the rear, and the other candidates bunched in the middle.</p>
        <p>The research team evaluated 15 comments from each candidate, listed in random order and without naming the source. The optimism rating depended largely on how candidates characterized problems: as temporary and manageable, signaling optimism, or chronic and global.</p>
        <p>''They're at war with us,'' said Mr. Giuliani of terrorists. ''They want to kill us.''</p>
        <p>Voters pick up these signals, consciously or not, and for good reason, Dr. Seligman said, adding, ''We know optimists tend to try harder under adversity, and that is a very important quality'' in a leader.</p>

        <p>Nagi Kawkabani, the co-chief executive of Brevan Howard Asset Management, a London-based hedge fund, went on a global road trip to drum up interest in a public offering.</p>
        <p>In 200 meetings over six weeks around the world, with executives from pension funds and endowments and other money managers, Mr. Kawkabani repeated the same story: hedge funds offer potential for extraordinary returns and a unique chance to diversify investments.</p>
        <p>But when his audience asked to see Alan Howard, the investment wizard who left Credit Suisse First Boston to help found Brevan Howard, they were told he was too busy to attend.</p>
        <p>Shielding the star of the firm may have cost Brevan Howard dearly. When it listed one of its funds on the London Stock Exchange on March 9, it raised about 770 million euros (just over $1 billion), only half of what it had expected to raise.</p>
        <p>''I am not surprised,'' said Herwig Langohr, professor of finance and banking at the Insead business school in Fontainebleau, France. ''I would not want to buy a security in a fund whose main manager I haven't met.''</p>
        <p>In hedge fund and equity funds, far more than in ordinary mutual funds, the track record and personality of the main investment manager are critical factors in attracting investors.</p>
        <p>But making their leaders more accessible isn't the only change that such funds may face. Long accustomed to operating secretively, hedge funds and private equity firms may need to get used to greater scrutiny if they want to capitalize on the keen interest in their high-returning funds and go public.</p>
        <p>But one of their biggest challenges will be to entice the small investor into a complex, sometimes arcane investing business, and to develop a credible public persona without spilling too many secrets.</p>
        <p>Among the firms considering how to accomplish that are Thomas H. Lee Partners and the Carlyle Group, two private equity firms; Citadel, an American hedge fund; and GLG Partners, a European hedge fund based in London, all of which have planned or are weighing offerings.</p>
        <p>The Blackstone Group, the New York-based private equity firm, started the countdown in March for its planned $4 billion offering this year. One of the world's biggest hedge funds, AQR Capital Management, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., and has about $35 billion under management, may also consider an initial public offering, analysts have said.</p>
        <p>But for the handful of firms that have listed recently, the results have been spotty.</p>
        <p>The Fortress Investment Group, a New York firm, raised $634 million when it listed on the New York Stock Exchange in February. The offering was heavily oversubscribed, but the stock price has since dropped 6 percent, and some analysts have suggested that such alternative funds may already be hitting the limit of investor interest.</p>
        <p>When Gottex Fund Management, a Swiss hedge fund, listed one of its funds in London in March, it raised £45.4 million ($90 million), less than a quarter of its goal of £200 million. Also in March, an infrastructure fund of the 3i Group, based in London, raised just more than half its goal of £1.3 billion.</p>
        <p>''There were enough people a year ago willing to invest in hedge funds just because they are hedge funds, but that's not the case anymore,'' said Patrick Reeve, managing director at Close Ventures, a venture capital company in London.</p>
        <p>The private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company raised $5 billion by listing an affiliate, KKR Private Equity Investors, in an initial offering last May in Amsterdam. That was three times as much as was originally planned for the fund. But the shares have never traded above the initial offer price of $25.</p>
        <p>Any disappointing public offering is also a blow to the sponsoring stock exchanges. The Amsterdam exchange, operated by Euronext (recently bought by the NYSE Group), and London have competed fiercely to attract such listings. London, which traditionally has had stricter listing rules than Amsterdam's, even changed the interpretation of those rules in October to be more competitive.</p>
        <p>The advantages for the firms selling shares in their funds are clear: they get a one-time windfall of permanent capital. But the advantages may be less assured for potential investors.</p>
        <p>First, the practices of hedge funds can be difficult to understand, and analyst research about the industry over all, let alone individual firms, is scarce. Second, hedge funds are, almost by definition, extremely secretive about their investment strategies.</p>
        <p>While they have to disclose enough information to persuade investors to buy shares, they do not want to give away too much to competitors.</p>
        <p>It is a steep learning curve for hedge funds, which typically know most of their investors. Now they will have to get used to a more fluctuating client base, said Richard Perry, a partner at the law firm Simmons &amp; Simmons in London.</p>
        <p>Moreover, investors may risk big losses even if the underlying fund makes great returns. That is because shares in hedge funds, like any stock, are influenced not only by the fund's performance but also by the ups and downs of stock markets.</p>
        <p>A stock market slump could actually push the value of the shares below the value of a fund's assets. Some funds -- but not all -- have clauses that give shareholders the right to sell their shares at a fixed price in such an event.</p>
        <p>Unlike current investors in private equity or hedge funds, whose money is typically locked in for several years, shareholders have the option of selling their shares at any time. But that assumes a willing buyer, and there is no guarantee that there will be enough trading in the stock to make it possible to dispose of shares.</p>
        <p>''You may end up losing out when you try to offload your shares and find that you would've been better off investing in the hedge fund directly,'' said Odi Lahav, director of European hedge fund ratings at Moody's, the debt rating agency, in London.</p>
        <p>A hedge fund has no decade-long track record to help investors determine whether it is a good addition to their portfolios, or for investment banks to set the right initial share price. Many hedge funds have not even existed for that long. The Brevan Howard fund, for example, was set up in 2003.</p>
        <p>As more of these deals come to market, assessing the markets' appetite and benchmarking the deals will become easier, Mr. Lahav said.</p>
        <p>He pointed out that even though Brevan Howard raised less money than it had envisioned, 770 million euros was still a respectable amount.</p>
        <p>The mixed experiences of hedge fund listings so far show that they are not easy to get right. That prospect may deter some, but others may learn from their competitors' mistakes, said Charles Cade, an analyst at Winterflood Securities, an investment trust in London.</p>
        <p>''The key is not to expect over a billion, and take a longer-term view,'' he said. ''What you don't want is to disappoint investors by missing the estimates.''</p>

        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-13</p>
        <p>Israeli Premier Rebuked Over War Against Lebanon  An Israeli government commission excoriated Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for ''severe failures'' in the war against Lebanon, setting off a debate on whether he should remain in office.  A1</p>
        <p>5 Guilty in London Bomb Plan  A jury found five British Muslim men guilty of planning fertilizer bomb attacks around London, after a yearlong trial that for the first time revealed evidence linking the plotters and two of the men who blew themselves up on London's transit system in July 2005.  A1</p>
        <p>Sunni Threat to Pull Ministers  The largest bloc of Sunni Arabs in the Iraqi Parliament threatened to withdraw its ministers from the cabinet over their government's failure to deal with Sunni concerns. President Bush stepped in, inviting one of Iraq's two vice-presidents to Washington.  A1</p>
        <p>Wolfowitz Hints at Resignation  Paul D. Wolfowitz defended himself, declaring that it would be ''unjust and frankly hypocritical'' for the World Bank's board to find him guilty of ethical lapses. He hinted that he would discuss resigning if the board cleared him of misconduct. A3</p>
        <p>U.S. Military Jailer in Iraq on Trial  A senior commander in the American military's main detention center in Baghdad testified at a military hearing that his predecessor, Lt. Col. William H. Steele, gave gifts to the daughter of a high-value detainee, breaching military law. A10</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A14-21</p>
        <p>Another Round of Rallies To Protest Deportations  Last year, hoping to influence Congress to adopt legislation making illegal immigrants legal, hundreds of thousands of immigrants held marches and work stoppages nationwide. There will be another round of marches and rallies, but this time immigrants will also be protesting a surge in deportations.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Drilling Expansion Is Proposed  The Bush administration proposed leasing out millions of acres along the coasts of Alaska and Virginia to oil and gas drillers, a move that would end a long-standing ban on drilling in those environmentally sensitive areas.</p>
        <p>A21</p>
        <p>Senate Debates Drug Bill  The Senate began debate on legislation that could fundamentally change the way the Food and Drug Administration operates by providing it with more power and more money to ensure that drugs are as safe as advertised.</p>
        <p>A18</p>
        <p>Court Rules in Favor of Police  The police did not violate a speeding driver's rights by ramming his car and causing an accident that left him permanently paralyzed, the Supreme Court ruled.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Client List Is Sought  The woman who faces charges of running a prostitution ring in Washington that serviced the prominent and powerful said that she intended to force many of those clients to testify in her behalf.</p>
        <p>A20</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION A22-23</p>
        <p>First Gambling Court Does a Brisk Business  Defendants at the country's first and only gambling treatment court, in Amherst, a Buffalo suburb, can avoid jail time by following a court-supervised program that includes counseling, credit checks and regular meetings with a judge. Mirroring the rise in gambling nationally, the court's caseload has grown steadily since it opened in 2001.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Subway Deaths Halt Work  More than 20 subway maintenance projects were put on hold as transit officials ordered all work on subway tracks, signals and tunnels halted for at least 48 more hours in response to the recent deaths of two track workers.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>An Apology for New Jersey  Gov. Jon S. Corzine apologized to New Jerseyans as he left a hospital in Camden 18 days after a devastating traffic accident in which he was not wearing a seat belt and was being driven at more than 91 miles on the Garden State Parkway.</p>

        <p>F.D.A. Labeled Unprepared  Last year, Food and Drug Administration inspectors sampled just 20,662 food shipments out of more than 8.9 million that arrived at American ports. Now critics in Washington are warning that the agency is understaffed and under-funded. C1</p>

        <p>Re ''M.I.T.'s Admissions Dean Resigns; Ends 28-Year Lie About Degrees'' (front page, April 27):</p>
        <p>One should not lie about one's formal qualifications. But on the other hand, as your article made clear, Marilee Jones had been doing the job well for a decade.</p>
        <p>She was a known quantity at M.I.T. when she was hired as its dean of admissions, having already worked at the institution for many years.</p>
        <p>If she could, and did, do this job well without a degree, why should she -- or anyone -- need a degree to be hired for it?</p>

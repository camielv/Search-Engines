        <p>Q. Is balding an indicator of more rapid aging and a shorter life span?</p>
        <p>A. No evidence of a link between hair loss and premature death was found in a large and well-known Danish study published in 1998 in The Journals of Gerontology. Perhaps surprisingly, other signs of aging like wrinkles and gray hair were not linked to early deaths, either.</p>
        <p>The study, involving a random sample of 20,000 men and women in the Copenhagen City Heart Study, recorded the extent of baldness, gray hair, wrinkles and a ring around the cornea, called arcus senilis, that often occurs in old age. The group was followed for 16 years.</p>

        <p>The authors concluded: ''We found no correlation between the mortality and the extent of graying of the hair or baldness or facial wrinkles in either of the sexes, irrespective of age. A single exception was observed in a small subgroup of men with no gray hair.'' Those lucky men had a slightly lower mortality rate, but the difference was statistically significant.</p>
        <p>Arcus senilis was significantly correlated with a shorter life span in women.</p>

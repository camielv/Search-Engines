        <p>In its first study of how an American company treats its workers, Human Rights Watch asserted yesterday that Wal-Mart's aggressive efforts to keep out labor unions often violated federal law and infringed on its workers' rights.</p>
        <p>Human Rights Watch, which typically focuses on rights violations in Burundi, North Korea or other foreign countries, said that when Wal-Mart stores faced unionization drives, the company often broke the law by, for example, eavesdropping on workers, training surveillance cameras on them and firing those who favored unions.</p>

        <p>In its first study of how an American company treats its workers, Human Rights Watch asserted yesterday that Wal-Mart's aggressive efforts to keep out labor unions often violated federal law and infringed on its workers' rights.</p>
        <p>Human Rights Watch, which typically focuses on rights violations in Burundi, North Korea or other foreign countries, said that when Wal-Mart stores faced unionization drives, the company often broke the law by, for example, eavesdropping on workers, training surveillance cameras on them and firing those who favored unions.</p>
        <p>''While many American companies use weak U.S. laws to stop workers from organizing, the retail giant stands out for the sheer magnitude and aggressiveness of its anti-union apparatus,'' the human rights group wrote.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart Stores has more than 1.3 million workers at its nearly 4,000 stores in the United States, and none of its workers belong to a union.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart, in response, vigorously defended its labor practices. David Tovar, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said that Wal-Mart provided an environment for open communications and gave its employees ''every opportunity to express their ideas, comments and concerns.''</p>
        <p>''It is because of our efforts to foster such an environment that our associates have repeatedly rejected unionization attempts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tovar said the report used unsubstantiated accusations from as long as seven years ago.</p>
        <p>Two of the five organizing drives that the 219-page report examined took place in 2005, while the other three campaigns took place more than five years ago.</p>
        <p>''Contrary to the allegations in this report, Wal-Mart respects our associates' right to a free and fair unionization vote,'' Mr. Tovar said. ''We remain committed to compliance with U.S. laws regarding workers' right to unionize.''</p>
        <p>Carol Pier, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch and author of the Wal-Mart report, said her organization decided to look specifically at Wal-Mart because of concerns about violations of labor laws.</p>
        <p>''When the largest private employer in the United States seems to be able to violate U.S. labor law with virtual impunity, that's a very serious cause for concern, both with respect to its impact on its employees, but also on the conduct by other employers in the United States,'' Ms. Pier said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart called the study ''pro-union.'' Ms. Pier said that only $50 of her organization's $33 million budget came from labor unions.</p>
        <p>Over the last few years, the main union for retail workers, the United Food and Commercial Workers, has suspended efforts to organize any Wal-Mart stores in the United States, largely because Wal-Mart's counteroffensive makes that so difficult, union officials said. Moreover, union officials said they could put more pressure on Wal-Mart by mounting a sophisticated publicity campaign to embarrass it over its wages, benefits and overall treatment of its employees.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the unionization drives described in the report, at Wal-Marts in Kingman, Ariz.; Aiken, S.C.; New Castle, Pa.; and Loveland and Greeley, Colo., grew out of discontent over wages and health benefits.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart says it has increased wages, to an average of $10.51 an hour for full-time workers, and has improved its health insurance, creating a plan with premiums of $23 a month anywhere in the country.</p>
        <p>''People want to work at Wal-Mart because we offer competitive wages, affordable health benefits and real career opportunities,'' Mr. Tovar said.</p>
        <p>But critics say that even with the increase in wages, many Wal-Mart workers still live below the poverty line and its low-premium health plan remains unaffordable to many workers because the deductibles often run to $3,000 a family.</p>
        <p>Human Right Watch issued a report in 2000 saying that America's labor laws and labor law enforcement were so weak that they made it difficult for workers to unionize and violate international labor standards.</p>
        <p>The report issued yesterday asserted that Wal-Mart took advantage of those weak laws to push its workers into opposing unions, by, for example, ordering them to attend meetings with anti-union speakers and videos.</p>
        <p>''Wal-Mart assets that respect for the individual is one of the core values that have made us into the company we are today,'' the report said. ''Wal-Mart's systematic interference with individual workers' right to freedom of association flies in the face of this professed core value.''</p>
        <p>The report found that unions and workers had brought 292 cases against Wal-Mart, with the National Labor Relations Board finding that 101 cases had merit. Those cases were consolidated into 39 complaints, with 17 administrative law judges ruling that Wal-Mart had violated labor laws. The labor board reversed two of those decisions.</p>

        <p>CBS's exclusive interview with the former director of central intelligence George J. Tenet on ''60 Minutes'' on Sunday might have captivated Washington, but it made only minor ripples in the ratings. According to Nielsen's estimates, the news magazine led the 7 p.m. hour with a below-average 10.8 million viewers, ranking second in the time period among adults 18 to 49, behind ABC's ''Funniest Home Videos,'' which drew 8.4 million total viewers. Although CBS tied ABC as the most-watched network of the night, it ranked third over all in the 18 to 49 set. Among viewers in that demographic, ABC's lineup of ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' at 8 (10.3 million), ''Desperate Housewives'' at 9 (16.9 million) and ''Brothers &amp; Sisters'' at 10 (11.5 million), remained dominant over all. Fox finished second with its animated comedy lineup, which included a first-ever victory for ''Family Guy'' (8.2 million) over ''Desperate Housewives'' at 9 among viewers 18 to 34. NBC was a distant fourth for the night in the 18 to 49 set. Its broadcast of the film ''Along Came Polly'' from 9 to 11 averaged 5.1 million viewers.</p>

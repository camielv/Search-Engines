        <p>The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival may have to start sharpening its identity.</p>
        <p>It began in 1999 as a rock festival with taste -- one that made a point of going deep in bringing together the bigger alternative-rock acts with dance music, and particularly bent itself toward white America's leisure class. And right after the looting and burning at Woodstock '99, Coachella seemed remarkably safe and conscientiously run.</p>
        <p>It still is. And Coachella still has taste, that elusive thing. With 122 different sets across five stages this year, it still managed to go fairly deep into new or cult-music territory. This year's festival, which ran through the weekend, has grown more than twice as big as it was in the first year, with a third day added and daily crowds of 50,000 to 60,000.</p>
        <p>Over the last few years, however, more single-location festivals have cropped up with similar consumers in mind, including Lollapalooza and the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago; Bonnaroo in Tennessee; Vegoose in Las Vegas; and Virgin Festival in Baltimore. Coachella isn't a breeze to get to; it's two hours away from Los Angeles, and with all its camping, it remains a pilgrimage, of a kind.</p>
        <p>But despite its successful trademark of putting on newsmaking reunions -- this year's included the Jesus and Mary Chain, Crowded House and Rage Against the Machine -- Coachella's lineup of bands is starting to look fairly standardized within the new pop-festival market. Without politics, religion or recreational drugs acting as some kind of centrifugal force, it's getting harder to know what the special thing is that you're making your pilgrimage toward. The Red Hot Chili Peppers? Ghostface Killah?</p>
        <p>For Coachella, the special thing could be the desert. Twilight shows here remain stunning for natural reasons. No matter what your degree of festival glaze, when the sun lowers, the air feels fresh, the sky seems endless, and music sounds better. But the sundown slot, before the headliner, is an unmistakably important one for a band, given the size of the crowd and the concentration of media within it. This is when bands put on their best game.</p>
        <p>On Friday evening the Scottish band the Jesus and Mary Chain, middle-aged and reunited after eight years, cast their dour gloss on 1960s bubblegum pop with its old clouds of noise and fuzz much reduced. The set was streamlined, dogged and shrewdly withheld; the force of the slow tempos and the guitar feedback was just powerful enough. Scarlett Johansson, one of a handful of famous actresses hanging out at the festival this year, joined the band for ''Just Like Honey.''</p>
        <p>But it was no big thing. The big thing was the band's singer, Jim Reid, and the rigor of his acid blankness; the corners of his mouth almost never turned above a flat line. ''Are you having fun?'' he asked the crowd, after singing ''Sidewalking.'' The crowd said yes. ''Well, we'll see what we can do about that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At twilight on Saturday, the much more positive Arcade Fire worked its best hand -- lustrous, world's-end romantic poetry in Springsteen overdrive -- in much the same way. Blankness, committedness: they were battling each other throughout the weekend.</p>
        <p>A certain amount of leftist politics were on display, but so was deep-dish navel-gazing. Tom Morello, performing a solo voice-and-guitar set under his new moniker the Nightwatchman, sang his new song, ''One Man Revolution,'' hammering home revolutionary agitprop with little groove or ornament.</p>
        <p>But the great English humorist Jarvis Cocker could be heard singing ''One Man Show,'' sketching a life of crass middle-aged loneliness and gearing up for ''a hot date with a baked potato.''</p>
        <p>The young English soul singer Amy Winehouse played on Friday with the American band the Dap-Kings as her backup. With a horn section and two rhythm guitars, the band knows the physics of chugging, Memphis-style '60s soul. But it also drives home the notion that Ms. Winehouse, who likes to sing about doing what she wants to do even if it's bad for her, is leaning hard on a very old and acceptable sound. She was a harsh, brittle performer, offsetting her talent with twitchy distraction.</p>
        <p>Lily Allen, the weekend's other young, female English pop star, radiated inexperience, forgetting words in the casually provocative teen-speak of her ska-pop songs and still having a cheery time. Even more deeply English were Arctic Monkeys, from Sheffield, as is Mr. Cocker. Arctic Monkeys' wordy, jokey, artfully un-self-conscious pub-punk, next to Mr. Cocker's mock grandiosity, traced the sensibilities of that single far-off town; lessons like this, among other things, are what festivals are for.</p>
        <p>Dance-music sets have always packed them in at Coachella; it is at those shows that an audience interested in microtrends relaxes its consumer clench. This year the schedule made it seem as if dance music were having a resurgence instead of a decline. One of the bigger slots -- main stage, end of Saturday night -- was given to D.J. Tiësto, who offered a rocked-up version of 1990s trance. The festival's Sahara tent alternated loads of electronic D.J. music with groups like LCD Soundsystem, the Rapture and the reunited Happy Mondays, who played live-band approximations of D.J. sets.</p>
        <p>Bjork's visually beautiful show was dance music, too: she merged electronic beats with a live drummer and an all-female brass choir, playing songs from her new record, ''Volta,'' as well as bigger rearrangements of old songs like ''Hyperballad'' and ''Joga.'' The same could be said for Konono No. 1, the Congolese band with three thumb-pianos sounding like a bass guitar and two rhythm guitars; its long, trancelike improvisations in a single mode made the crowd move and cheer as if it heard the next big thing.</p>
        <p>There was a cresting of politics on Sunday night, and everyone expected it. Manu Chao, the French-Spanish troubadour, played a strong set of old and new songs within his framework of broad folk-populism: reggae double-timing into punk; flamenco guitar; peace slogans and chants in Spanish and English; simulated radio patter; sampled siren sounds going off at intervals. He was angry, but offered solutions.</p>
        <p>''You cannot fight terrorism with terrorism,'' he said, after dedicating a song to President Bush. ''You can fight terrorism with education and schools.''</p>
        <p>Rage Against the Machine was just angry, and nearly all business. Back together for its first show in seven years -- others are to follow, at least through this summer -- it went precisely back to where it left off. Where Manu Chao was noisily border-crossing, setting off sampled sirens to suggest close-range urban bustle, Rage wants its audience to feel the fear and dread of places where the working classes die in their uniforms, and a violent urge to disobey.</p>
        <p>Part of the band's sound, and part of its riffs, come from the hard midtempo funk of Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsies, but their songs are far more rigid in every way -- feeling, design, sentiment. Given such a long layoff, the band played hard and well. Still, seven years isn't such a long time, and all was much the same: Zack De La Rocha's enraged whine lives intact; Tom Morello still makes his guitar rant and spit, his control over the wah-wah pedal and his guitar's kill-switch undiminished.</p>
        <p>The crowd bounced like springs, and yet, on another level, the music came off almost purely as a political project. Only in a version of Afrika Bambaataa's ''Renegades of Funk'' -- with lines like ''every time I pop into the beat we get fresh'' -- was it clear that this was only a rock band.</p>

        <p>Morocco and the Polisario Front, which are struggling for control of resource-rich Western Sahara, agreed to hold direct talks for the first time under the terms of a unanimously passed United Nations Security Council resolution. Morocco, which annexed the Front in 1979, hopes to incorporate it as an autonomous province with its own regional government. The Polisario Front wants a referendum that will offer the 260,000 residents the choice of autonomy or independence from Morocco.</p>

        <p>Correction:  May 8, 2007, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, a report in the World Briefing column last Tuesday, about direct talks between Morocco and the Polisario Front under terms of a Security Council resolution, referred incorrectly to the area Morocco annexed in 1979. It was the Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony that Morocco hopes to incorporate as an autonomous province -- not the Front, a group seeking Western Sahara's independence.</p>

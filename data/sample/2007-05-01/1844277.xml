        <p>Gripping a semiautomatic rifle, Alonso Carrión, a ranger at Galápagos National Park, recently showed off an impressive arsenal inside a well-guarded complex here.</p>
        <p>It contained .223-caliber rifles, exploding bullets, telescopic sights, two-way radios, nylon nets and a kennel with dogs imported from New Zealand. If it seemed arsenal enough to fend off an invasion, that was precisely its intent.</p>
        <p>This archipelago, which inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, has been for many decades the scene of a war between two nonnative species that have drastically altered life here. It is a battle of man versus goat.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes we have to kill one animal so that others can survive,'' Mr. Carrión, 36, explained.</p>
        <p>Man is finally winning, thanks to about $10 million from private donors and the United Nations to pay for the extermination project dreamed up by park officials and the Charles Darwin Foundation.</p>
        <p>Pilots from New Zealand were hired to fly helicopters above the largest island, Isabela, so that gunmen could reach herds of goats with AR-15 rifles and one million rounds of ammunition imported from the United States.</p>
        <p>They killed tens of thousands of goats, which disturb a prized environment and threaten native species like tortoises by competing for food like cactus, rangers and scientists say.</p>
        <p>Shooting teams also went out on foot, accompanied by goat-sniffing dogs. Over sunbaked lava terrain that tears hiking boots to shreds, they tracked packs of goats in outings that lasted up to 20 days. They left thousands of goat carcasses to decompose under the tropical sun.</p>
        <p>Today some of the smaller islands and part of Isabela Island are almost rid of goats. ''It hasn't been pleasant, but it's absolutely necessary for the future of the islands,'' said Felipe Cruz, a galapagueño, as those born here are called, who helps oversee the extermination.</p>
        <p>The Galápagos goat problem evolved, so to speak, over time. Whalers are thought to have left the first goats on these islands, about 600 miles from Ecuador's mainland, almost two centuries ago as a food source when the islands were little more than a pit stop for their ships from New England.</p>
        <p>The whaling traffic petered out later in the 19th century when the first petroleum boom drove demand for whale oil down, but the goats multiplied. By the late 1990s, more than 140,000 wild goats made the Galápagos Islands their home.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the human population, which arrived at roughly the same time as Darwin in the 1830s and numbered less than 1,000 in the middle of the last century, has expanded to about 30,000. It is growing at more than 6 percent a year, or more than twice the rate in the rest of Ecuador.</p>
        <p>With no comprehensive program to limit population growth here, growing commercial activities fuel tension. A small group of park officials brawled with more than two dozen military service members last month on Baltra Island after discovering illegal sea kayaking permitted by the Air Force. Battling goats has proved easier.</p>
        <p>The goat extermination effort, which began in the 1970s before gathering momentum in the late 1990s, has raised ethical questions.</p>
        <p>Poor residents who rely on goat meat for food and income, particularly on Santa Cruz Island, where officials hope to expand their eradication efforts, have opposed the project.</p>
        <p>The park has long allowed galapagueños and other settlers to hunt goats on Santa Cruz, the most populous island with about 18,000 residents. Live goats fetch about $15 a head for sale to dealers who ship them to slaughterhouses in Guayaquil, on the mainland, but hunters say their prey has become harder to find since park rangers increased the scope of their own hunts.</p>
        <p>''They're killing these goats from helicopters and leaving them to die out there when I'm trying to feed my children,'' Eladio Peñafiel, 35, said in an interview as he prepared to go goat hunting on horseback. ''It's as if they want to exterminate us, too.''</p>
        <p>Others contend that the focus on goats is just the latest example of man's efforts to shape life.</p>
        <p>''The environment of the Galápagos has already been massively impacted by human activities,'' said Robert H. Nelson, an expert on natural resource management at the University of Maryland. ''The actions there now are in effect merely creating a simulation of God's original nature untouched by human hand. It is more like Disneyland than the real thing.''</p>
        <p>Park officials have little patience for the criticism, pointing to their efforts against other invasive species, like wild donkeys, cats and rats. Introduced plants like blackberries and guava also threaten native vegetation, and projects are under way to limit them.</p>
        <p>So they are releasing so-called Judas goats -- sterilized females treated with hormones -- to lure straggling surviving goats into the open where they can be killed, and they keep the hunting dogs at the ready.</p>
        <p>''We're at war, and we've won one of our biggest battles,'' said Mr. Cruz, the hunting overseer. ''But we can't rest until we kill them all.''</p>
        <p>That may ultimately be impossible. People here have already jeopardized the eradication project by reintroducing goats into the wild, according to park officials. A walk through Barrio La Cascada, a poor area of the town of Puerto Ayora, shows the challenges of trying to limit the activities of both goat and man.</p>
        <p>Construction crews are building dozens of cinder-block houses, including some on the boundary of the park itself. The newcomers lace their Spanish with Quechua, the main indigenous language of Ecuador's highlands. And here, bouncing along a dirt road amid the half-built hovels, is a goat.</p>
        <p>Germán Manzano, 47, a truck driver, found the goat on the road from the airport and brought it home to his wife. ''I'm deciding between selling him or fattening him up,'' he said. ''I think we'll eat him soon.''</p>

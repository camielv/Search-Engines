        <p>'Sesame Street' Takes On a Role in the Middle East  ''Sesame Street'' is returning to Israel and the Palestinian territories. Years after the original episodes went off television because of a lack of financing, the show is returning in Israeli and Palestinian versions, The Associated Press reported. For the first time, the Israeli version, ''Rechov Sumsum,'' will feature an Israeli Muppet of Arab origin, Mahoub, who speaks Hebrew and Arabic. And new human actors will include Russian and Ethiopian Jewish immigrants, who have been unwelcome to some Israelis. The Palestinian show, ''Shara'a Simsim,'' seeks to offer positive role models to boys in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Gary Knell, the president of Sesame Workshop, the New York-based nonprofit organization behind ''Sesame Street'' programming worldwide, said, ''There's a desire of the political leaders to change the endless debate that seems to be passed down from generation to generation.''</p>
        <p>New Law to Protect Critics From Being Misquoted  The European Commission has passed legislation that would keep bad reviews from looking good, the London newspaper The Independent reported. The measure, to take effect in December, will make it illegal for advertisers to misquote reviewers by taking a positive word or phrase from a theater review if it gives a misleading sense of the whole review. The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive bars advertising that includes ''false information'' or any claim that ''deceives or is likely to deceive the consumer'' and thus ''causes or is likely to cause him to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.'' Helen Kearns, the commission's spokeswoman on consumer affairs, said the measure would be ''policed on a case-by-case basis'' by the Office of Fair Trading. ''It should apply to misleading advertising right across the board,'' she added, ''from airline tickets to theater tickets.''</p>
        <p>Egypt Seeks Loan Of Museum Antiquities  Egypt plans to appeal to museums abroad for the temporary return of some of its most precious artifacts, including the Rosetta Stone and a bust of Nefertiti, above, The Associated Press reported. Zahi Hawass, secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the Foreign Ministry would send letters this week to France, Germany, the United States and Britain asking for the loan of the ancient works, to be exhibited either in 2011 at the opening of the Egyptian Museum near the Great Pyramids at Giza or in 2010 at the opening of the Atum Museum in the Nile Delta city of Meniya. The 1,680-pound Rosetta Stone, a key to deciphering ancient hieroglyphics, is in the British Museum, where a spokeswoman, Hannah Boulton, said a loan request would be considered. Germany has already balked at requests to lend the 3,000-year-old bust of Nefertiti from its Egyptian Museum in Berlin. Mr. Hawass said he was also seeking the zodiac ceiling painting from the Dendera Temple, now in the Louvre; the statue of Hemiunu in the Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum in Hildesheim, near Hanover, Germany; and the bust of Anchhaf at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.</p>
        <p>Barbra Streisand To Tour Europe  Barbra Streisand will start what is billed as her first tour of continental Europe when she sings on June 21 in Vienna, and on July 18 she will give her first concert in England since 1994, Concert Productions International has announced. The European tour will take her to Paris on June 26, Nice on July 10 and Dublin on July 14. The promoters said additional dates would be announced shortly. Ms. Streisand is to be accompanied by a 58-piece orchestra.  The complete lyrics of Sting, including those of hits like ''Roxanne,'' ''Every Breath You Take'' and ''Spirits in the Material World,'' will be published in the fall in book form under the title ''Lyrics by Sting'' by Dial Press, an imprint of the Bantam Dell Publishing Group, The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>Langella to Play Nixon In Ron Howard Movie  Frank Langella, above, will recreate the role of Richard M. Nixon when the Peter Morgan play ''Frost/Nixon'' is adapted for the screen under the direction of Ron Howard, Variety.com reported. Michael Sheen, starring as the interviewer David Frost opposite Mr. Langella on Broadway, will reprise his role in the film, scheduled to go before the cameras on Aug. 27.  Ridley Scott, who directed Russell Crowe in ''Gladiator,'' will direct him again when he stars in ''Nottingham,'' Variety. com reported. The film, scheduled to go into production next year, is a revisionist version of the Robin Hood legend that presents the Sheriff of Nottingham as noble and brave (though he works for a wicked king).</p>

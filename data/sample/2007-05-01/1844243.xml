        <p>Government investigators said Monday that byproducts from pet food contaminated with wheat gluten imported from China were used in chicken feed on some farms in Indiana.</p>
        <p>The latest revelation came as part of the investigation into imported rice protein concentrate and wheat gluten that have been found to contain melamine and melamine-related compounds. Pet food contaminated with melamine has killed at least 16 cats and dogs and sickened thousands of others.</p>

        <p>Government investigators said Monday that byproducts from pet food contaminated with wheat gluten imported from China were used in chicken feed on some farms in Indiana.</p>
        <p>The latest revelation came as part of the investigation into imported rice protein concentrate and wheat gluten that have been found to contain melamine and melamine-related compounds. Pet food contaminated with melamine has killed at least 16 cats and dogs and sickened thousands of others.</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department and the Food and Drug Administration said that some 30 broiler poultry farms and eight breeder poultry farms in Indiana had received contaminated feed in early February and fed it to chickens within days of receiving it. All of those potentially affected chickens have since been processed.</p>
        <p>The two agencies said they believed the likelihood of illness to people eating contaminated chicken was low because the contamination was most likely diluted. Without evidence of harm to humans, the agencies said they were not issuing recalls of any of the processed chicken products.</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department and the F.D.A. revealed last week that eight pork producers in seven states had purchased adulterated feed. Some 6,000 hogs were quarantined as a result in California, Kansas, North Carolina, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah. Authorities are also in contact with a feed mill in Missouri that might have received adulterated products.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Tyson Foods acknowledged that it had sent nearly 200 hogs that may have eaten feed containing melamine to a pork-processing plant. But the F.D.A. and the U.S.D.A. said they were not concerned that those hogs posed any risk to people, according to Bloomberg News.</p>
